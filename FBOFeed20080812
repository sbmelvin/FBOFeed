<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with BTR Inc., 11300 Corobon Lane, Great Falls, VA 22066 for services regarding the generation of cell lines from primary multiple myeloma and MGUS tumors.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be for two months from date of award.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide services to support the study entitled "Generation of Cell Lines from Primary Multiple Myeloma and MGUS Tumors", as part of an inter-agency agreement between the NCI, DHHS and NNMC, Defense Department. The work will include the construction of lentivirus vectors that can express oncogenes and viral genes as protein products that inactivate tumor suppressor genes. These vectors will be transfected into packaging cells that will produce infectious lentiviral particles. Combinations of infectious lentiviral particles will be used to infect primary multiple myeloma tumor cells with the expectation that some combinations of these lentiviral particles will generate permanent myeloma cell lines from tumor cells that otherwise could not be grown as cell lines.  The resultant myeloma cell lines would then be compared with the original tumor cells to determine what phenotypic changes have occurred as a result of the transition from in vivo tumor cell to an in vitro cell line.  The myeloma cell lines will also be used to assess the value of different therapeutic agents.</p>
<p>The contractor must provide uniquely qualified professionals, Research Scientists, to do this work based on the following considerations.  First, experience growing primary multiple myeloma tumor cells and multiple myeloma cell lines in tissue culture. Second, knowledge on establishing the conditions for isolating and  growing normal B-lymphocytes in tissue culture, and then using combinations of cytokines that enable her to cause these cells to differentiate into normal plasmablasts and plasma cells, which are the normal counterpart of multiple myeloma tumor cells.  Third, extensive experience (PhD. and published papers) in the construction and use of lentiviral agents to efficiently introduce exogenous genes into quiescent or minimally proliferating normal and tumor cells. Fourth, experience in lentiviral vectors to express several of the genes that are likely needed to generate cell lines from primary myeloma tumor cells.  Fifth, experience developing a number of specialized cell and molecular biological procedures that are necessary to efficiently carry out the proposed experiments.   BTR Inc. is the only known source that meets all the requirements described above in order to perform the requested services.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on August 26, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80171-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for approximately 410 Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) Kits for the J52 engine in the Navys EA-6B aircraft, and intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with United Technologies Corporation/Pratt & Whitney, Military Engines 20, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108-0968.  The applicable NAICS Code is 336412, Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing.  The IGV kits consist of 2 bolts with self-locking heli-coils (P/N ST2601-11) and 2 spacers (P/N 2194927), and are intended to reduce the looseness of the bolts that securely fasten the IGV to the outer coupling.  Bolt looseness allows movement of the vanes relative to the outer coupling causing wear of the bolt, vane, and the coupling.  Continued wear to the vane may lead to loss of outer diameter retention which could lead to the vanes shifting aftward into the 1st stage blade path, causing 1st stage blade damage at a minimum.  This could lead to a possible In-Flight Shutdown (IFSD).  These IGV kits will mitigate this risk and prevent Driver IGV looseness by replacing the "tall head bolt" with a standard bolt and high-alpha spacer beneath the bolt head.  This will provide a longer clamped length, which increases resistance to movement due to vibration and thermal mismatch.  United Technologies Corporation/Pratt & Whitney (Pratt & Whitney) has rights in privately developed commercial technologies and processes incorporated into the J52 engine and has privately developed computer software needed for J52 analysis.  This privately developed data, along with the corporate expertise necessary to identify and correct problems with the J52 engine, are the sole property of Pratt & Whitney.  Given their involvement with the design, development, qualification, manufacturing, and continuing improvements of the J52 engine, their ready access to the original design intent, original engineering drawings, and the most recent design changes to the J52, and their immediate access to the necessary special tooling, special test equipment, and test facilities necessary to prototype and test proposed J52 engineering solutions, Pratt & Whitney is the only known firm with the technical expertise, technical knowledge, and technical data to provide the required IGV Kits.  It is anticipated that a task order under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) containing one firm fixed price (FFP) CLIN will be awarded.  The term of the task order is expected to be approximately twelve months.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire a GWI Help Desk Application in support of the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source Acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.   This application will provide ticket creation, routing, updating and closing and Customer Service Level Agreements (SLAs) which can be based on category, customer or template.  The system includes Unlimited License Agreements. Based on Market Research it was determined that Groupware Incorporated DBA GWI Software is the only company that can provide a stand alone system that meets all the requirements of the National Naval Medical Center. No other company currently provides custom SLAs based on category, customer and template. GWI is the only application which currently provides relational incidents, which are tied together with assets, modifications, and technicians so as one is modified the other are automatically updated.  GWI is also the only helpdesk application which currently provides real-time lessons learned based on incidents, and technician input.  GWI is the only helpdesk application that does not only inventory management, but also software licenses management and historical comparisons. This procurement is being conducted as a commercial item acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12, using Subpart 13.5 test program procedures.  Award of a firm fixed contract is anticipated. All required deliverables shall be furnished within 30 days after date of contract award.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard for this procurement is 511210 and 500 employees respectively.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending challenges to David Moore at david.moore8@navy.mil.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all challenges to this sole source determination received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

NBZ081 CPARS PAST PERFORMANCEThe Federal Acquisition (FAR) requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected (FAR Part 42) and used in source selection evaluation (FAR Part 14).  The CPARS process establishes procedures for the collection and use of PPI for business sector contracts.  CPARS generated PPI is one of many tools used to communicate Contractor strengths and weaknesses to Source Selection Officials and Contracting Officers.  The use of an automated CPARs collection tool, http://cpars.navy.mil is aimed at reducing reliance on paper, improving the business process, and being more efficient.  This is one of several initiatives the DON has deployed to meet DODs paperless contracting mandates.  DON is utilizing the CPARS Automated Information System (AIS) to collect PPI and pass it to the Federal Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) where PPI will be available to be retrieved by all the Services.

<DESC>The U. S. EPA, Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, for NAS to provide an objective assessment and validation of scientific and engineering excellence in EPA?s mission and programs; informing the Agency of relevant scientific and technical data and related views of experts about research and science activities; and to provide support in applying the judgments of science and engineering to public policy.  Under the proposed procurement, the National Research Council (NRC) of NAS will provide expert advice by convening review committees that will perform timely reviews and recommendations on a variety of issues associated with ORDs mission and programs.
EPA requires the services of an expert, highly prestigious and objective organization to provide independent advice and review of the high priority, cross-Agency science issues that comprise the EPA Science Agenda.  NAS is the only known source that can provide this broad range of scientific expertise at a level of objectivity and public acceptability that is critical to meet the EPAs needs under this procurement.  Objectivity and unbiased judgment are imperative because of the intense interest and scrutiny of the Agencys policies and decisions by the public, Congress, the regulated and environmental communities and other stakeholders.  
The National Academies members are without Peers in their field, with unquestioned objectivity and independence.  As the preeminent scientific organization in the nation, the NAS has the unique ability to assemble the nations most highly distinguished scholars and scientists to serve on boards and committees to address national environmental problems requiring scientific input that are of high priority and often of urgent need covering the full range of scientific and technical disciplines. 
An indefinite quantity type contract, with a maximum value of $15 Million, is anticipated.  The ordering period will be five years.  This notice is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation will be issued based on this notice.  However, any organizations believing itself capable of meeting EPAs needs may submit documentation to demonstrate its qualifications to meet the EPAs needs.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. 
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690.  The anticipated award date is 12/30/08.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Cincinnati?s Environmental Engineering Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio to purchase services to conduct a comparative study of Natural Materials with Engineered Nano-Particles for the Office of Research and Development/National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) Cincinnati Ohio.EPA/NRMRL is looking to study the fate and transport of nano-particles in soil systems and how the presence of these nano-particles influence contaminant transports and soil remediation technologies. EPA will focus this research on comparing nano-particles occurring naturally with engineered ones based on their mobility in soil systems, aggregation and dissolution to increase the understanding on the fate of nano-particles.  EPA intends to use materials such as silica as a model for naturally occurring nano-materials, whereas titania and iron oxide for engineered particles having varying reactive properties. The mobility of nano-particles through porous media and their tendency to aggregate or agglomerate to form larger macro-scale particles will be evaluated under different conditions.  EPA will study the influence of accumulated nano-materials on contaminants mobility and soil remediation technologies such as encapsulation techniques. 
A.  MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  The contractor shall have the facility and expertise in measuring the fate and movement of environmentally persistent contaminant in soil. The equipment for the comparative study of Natural Materials with Engineered Nano-Particles include:
     -  Experimental system will be built to simulate ground water and nano-particles                   movement.  The system will allow varying process variables and sample                 collections from various points in the process.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice for the Transportation Threat Assessment & Credentialing (TTAC), Hazmat Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) office is to request contractor support a single-point information management system and web site tool that enables applicants to submit biographic and biometric (fingerprints) information, collect fees, and provide applicants information on services and enrollment locations.  The system will operate totally from the established fees collected according to DHS, TSA, and Hazmat Fee Rules: Fees for Security Threat Assessments for Hazmat Drivers; Final Rule (49CFR Part 1572 January 13, 2005).  

BACKGROUND

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act was enacted on October 25, 2001.  Section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended 49 U.S.C. Chapter 51 by adding a new section 5103a titled Limitation on Issuance of Hazmat Licenses.  Section 5103a prohibits a State from issuing to any individual a license to transport hazardous materials in commerce unless a determination has been made that the individual does not pose a security risk.  The risk assessment includes checks of relevant criminal history databases, immigration and legal status, and relevant international databases where applicable.  

The TSA Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program meets this statutory mandate and conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) for anyone who seeks to apply for, renew or transfer a Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) on their state-issued Commercial Drivers License (CDL).  The TSA security threat assessment includes a (1) fingerprint-based FBI Criminal History Records Check (CHRC), (2) an immigration/legal status check and (3) an intelligence-related check for ties to terrorism.  
	
Applicants must forward biographical and biometric (fingerprint) information to TSA in an approved and established format to facilitate the security threat assessment process.  TSA allowed States to elect to perform the biographical and biometric collection, or utilize a TSA-contracted agent to perform these functions on their behalf.  Fifteen States currently collect the required biographical information and biometric data through their individually established and maintained programs.  Thirty-Seven States and the District of Columbia utilize the TSA-contracted agent (for the purposes of this document it is understood the term State or States includes the District of Columbia).  Additionally, drivers registered in a state serviced by the contractor (TSA Agent) may be fingerprinted in any other state serviced by the TSA Agent.  

CAPABILITIES COVERAGE

Congress has directed that this program be fee-based and self-sustaining.  TSA established fees to fund the threat assessment after providing the public an opportunity to comment on proposed fees.  The fee per applicant is comprised of three elements:  

(1)	the cost for collecting and processing fingerprint and application information (vendor fee); 
(2)	the fee the FBI charges to run the fingerprints against the criminal history records; and 
(3)	a TSA program fee to cover costs to administer the program, including conducting the security threat assessments.  

Payment of the Federal fee is a requirement to undergo the TSA security threat assessment, and is established through the Federal rule-making process. Vendors must have capability to remit fees collected, directly to TSA.     

TSA seeks to identify a vendor that can provide the following services above.  The system is comprised of the following broad categories:

(1)  Enrollment 
(2)  Fingerprint Collection 
(3)  Help Desk 
(4)  Web site 
(5)  Fee Collection and Reconciliation 
(6)  DHS/TSA IT system requirements 

ADMINISTRATIVE 
The TSA intends to solicit for a Fee Based, Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract on or around the August 29, 2008.   This solicitation will be for a one-year base period and (three) one-year option periods. This will be a best value procurement.   

Any questions or inquiries must be emailed to the TSA Office of Acquisition to Audrey.Taylor@dhs.gov and to Ricky.McGlothin@dhs.gov.

<DESC>COHERENT X-RAY SCATTERING MARKET RESEARCH

RESPONSES DUE BY: 5:00 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time, September 12, 2008.


1.0	REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
1.1	Introduction
The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS/S&T) Explosives Division (EXD) desires to promote further development of Coherent X-Ray Scattering (CXS) (or Diffraction (CXD)) technology as a reliable method for identifying and/or detecting explosives in airport baggage.  CXS is a high-interest research project being coordinated with the Transportation Security Administrations Chief Technology Office (TSA/CTO) and in conjunction with other Explosives Division R&D activities.
This RFI is being issued to ascertain the level-of-interest and capabilities of private industry to develop prototype systems suitable for laboratory assessment by the Government.  This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.
1.2	RFI Objectives
The Coherent X-ray Scattering (CXS) Project is a critical element in the broader Manhattan II and Explosives Research programs aimed at stimulating commercial industry development and integration of key enabling technologies, subsystems and advanced algorithms for application to next generation checked baggage systems that provide improved performance and affordability characteristics.  S&T informal market research has indicated that industry contractors either have mature coherent x-ray scattering technologies that do not currently meet TSA needs or immature technologies that need further development as prototype systems before being sufficiently mature to conduct a meaningful laboratory assessment and data collection process.  It is anticipated that approximately 1  2 years additional development and integration effort will be required by commercial industry contractors in order to deliver to the Government prototype systems suitable for laboratory assessment and testing for aviation passenger carry-on and checked baggage screening venues.
Respondents to this RFI will be requested to provide sufficient information to determine pre qualification both as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and as US companies or US-registered subsidiaries of foreign companies.  Organizations or companies will be invited to submit descriptions of their offering in 10 pages or less.  Please see Section 1.9 of this RFI for further information on the desired content of white papers submitted for consideration.  Proprietary information, performance capabilities or future modification plans will be accepted and appropriately protected by the Government.  Based on white paper submissions in response to this RFI, the Government may encourage interested companies to submit proposals to an S&T Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for development and delivery of two prototype systems and related data.  The two prototype systems are primarily intended for laboratory assessment of detection and throughput capabilities, however, affordability will be a future consideration based on acquisition planning by TSA.  CXS prototype system capabilities will be assessed for potential deployment as stand-alone EDS or as adjunct, secondary screening devices as further discussed in Section 1.3; both configurations are welcome for submission.
1.3	Potential Concept of Operations (ConOps)
The preliminary technical requirements identified in Section 1.6 of this RFI are intended to provide sufficient guidance for interested respondents to understand the potential future ConOps under which TSA may consider further field testing of any prototype systems resulting from this solicitation.  CXS systems could be used to identify explosive materials in checked or carry-on baggage, including alarm resolution as a secondary EDS device.  Industry sources are requested to identify in their white paper the envisioned ConOps for a future CXS system as either a stand-alone security screening system or deployed in conjunction with current or future EDS equipment.
1.4	Technology Maturity
S&T believes the current state of CXS detection technology indicates significant company-funded development and integration effort will be needed to achieve targeted Technology Readiness Levels.  The maturity of any prototype system delivered to the Government for lab assessment should be consistent with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or 6 defined as follows:
TRL 5:  Component validation in a relevant environment.
TRL 6:  System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in relevant environment.

Interested respondents should address in their white papers the magnitude and duration of additional company-funded development effort that will be needed to achieve the Governments TRL objective for prototypical systems.  For this RFI and any subsequent proposal, a component under the TRL 5 definition is considered to be the necessary subsystems to detect and identify threat materials, provide an operator interface and collect data in support of system performance assessment.
1.5	Preliminary Program Structure
This section of the RFI is intended to describe the preliminary program structure envisioned by the Government including ground rules, cost estimating assumptions and notional program milestones.  Industry is expected to fund any necessary system development, integration and baseline testing in order to provide the following primary deliverables for any subsequent contract that may be awarded.
	Two prototype systems for each selected contractor suitable for lab assessment delivered to Government with system description, technical data package and preliminary operations manual.
	Industry develops and integrates key enabling technologies, subsystems and algorithms for two prototype systems (TRL 5-6 maturity) suitable for testing in lab environment to assess performance.
	Industry conducts program review briefing, develops test plan and collects baseline performance data.  Copy of information and data provided to Government.
	The contract period of performance could be up to 2 years as determined by the Offeror.  Estimated target cost for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract would be approximately $2-3M for each selected contractor for procuring the contractor proposed system information, all hardware, and baseline performance data.  A preliminary cost estimate is requested in any white paper responses to this RFI.  
	Government will purchase two hardware systems and associated technical information and data at fixed cost but will use phased payment of total contract cost based on series of payable milestones.
	S&T does not intend to select the system design or contract for developmental engineering efforts.  The Government would get a summary briefing of system capabilities and appropriate baseline testing data to demonstrate proper operation and readiness for delivery to the Government.
	Contractor test data and performance projections would be provided to the Government to support Government lab assessment.  The two purchased systems from any selected contractor would be delivered to Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL) for lab assessment and potentially transferred to TSA's new T&E center (TSIF) for pilot testing.  
	The contractor would provide technical support for their systems using a follow-on contract option for a period of up to one year.  Contractors will have access to some of the pilot testing data depending on classification but not the government assessment of performance. 
	Any future acquisition plans for a Coherent X-ray Scattering system would be determined by TSA.  S&T and TSA would cooperatively collect operational data during any lab or pilot testing for assessment of the system to meet TRD performance objectives and to develop future acquisition plans.
Based on industry white paper responses to this RFI, S&T is planning to use a BAA solicitation to award firm fixed price contracts to deliver two prototype systems suitable for laboratory assessment.  Any contractor interested in submitting a proposal will also assume responsibility for final design, manufacture and integration to meet requirements that will be further defined in a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) issued at a future date.
Any proposals submitted to the Government under the BAA would be required to discuss the scope and schedule plans for conducting a contractor program review, providing overall system description and technical data package, delivery of two systems for Government testing, and providing contractor technical support for approximately one year laboratory or pilot testing.  S&T has developed the following notional model for payable milestones and is requesting contractor comments or recommendations in conjunction with any white papers or subsequent proposals.  During execution of any awarded contracts, completion of the milestone and subsequent invoice payment would be based on S&T Program Manager approval or concurrence.  A notional set of payable milestones (based on a notional 24 month total period of performance) are as follows:
	Contractor Program Review  Estimated six (6) months after contract award (ACA); successful completion criteria is comprehensive briefing on system design and performance objectives; completion payment = 10% of contract total cost.
	Contractor T&E Plan and Data License Complete  Estimated twelve (12) months ACA; successful completion criteria is agreed test plan to demonstrate system operation and performance and a Data Access License Agreement (if needed); completion payment = 10% of contract total cost.
	Contractor First Prototype Power On  Estimated eighteen (18) months ACA; successful completion criteria is power on and successful operation of first prototype system; completion payment = 30% of contract total cost.
	Contractor Second Prototype Power On and Commencement of Lab Testing  Estimated twenty two (22) months ACA; successful completion criteria is power on and successful operation of second prototype system and commencement of contractor conducted lab testing; completion payment = 30% of contract total cost.
	Contractor Completion of Lab Testing  Estimated twenty four (24) months ACA; successful completion of agreed test plan and delivery of both prototype systems and data to the Government = 20% of contract total cost.
	Priced option for contractor provided support to government for 1 year duration after delivery of first system = TBD cost.
1.6	Preliminary Technical Requirements
The preliminary technical requirements identified in this Section of the RFI are intended to provide sufficient guidance for interested respondents to understand the desired capabilities and performance of any prototype systems resulting from this solicitation.  Prototype CXS systems and/or subsystems should demonstrate the following capabilities:
	Detects and identifies a wide variety of military, commercial and homemade explosives (HME) that could be concealed in airport baggage.
	Meets or exceeds current TSA EDS certification standards.
	Discriminates between explosives and non-threat substances in airport baggage.
	Identifies (preferred) specific explosive materials, or at a minimum, detects the presence of explosives.
	False Alarm Rates (FAR) of less than five percent (5%).
	Minimum system throughput (in a stand-alone commercial aviation Checked Baggage screening application) of 300 bags per hour (bph) and a mean process time of less than ten (10) seconds per bag.
	Compatible with current TSA checked baggage x-ray system size and weight constraints.
	Compliant with all TSA system safety specifications for explosives detection systems.  Safety compliance will be verified by an OSHA-accredited 3rd party laboratory.
	Provides a fully-specified and documented data retrieval capability that enables download of raw and reconstructed image data and system configuration information from the system.  This interface must also provide structured access to any on-board store of this type of data.
A more extensive TRD will be developed in coordination with TSA.  In addition to the above desired capabilities, it is anticipated that the TRD will describe explosive materials to be identified and/or detected, minimum detection rates, acceptable false alarm rates, potential deployment ConOps, and operator interfaces.  The TRD will be "Sensitive Security Information (SSI), sensitive but unclassified, and will be provided separately for interested companies submitting proposals to the BAA.  
United States citizenship is a prerequisite to receiving SSI.  Prior to receiving a copy of the TRD or laboratory assessment data, individuals must submit a signed copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that accompanies this RFI.
IMPORTANT NOTE:  Only companies with a bona fide need to know (i.e. original equipment manufacturing (OEM) companies that develop and produce explosive detection systems or subsystems) will be eligible to receive a copy of the SSI TRD.  Retailers, dealers or other interested parties are not eligible to receive the TRD.
1.7	Data Rights and Image Format Standards
Data rights requirements for the CXS project will be consistent with other TSA data rights policies and standard procedures for new detection technologies and prototype screening systems.  S&T desires to maintain all rights to the raw image data produced by the prototype system, including all related data required to convert raw data into reconstructed images.  This data shall be provided to S&T and/or TSA upon request, along with the means and methods to reconstruct and manipulate the images.  
Performance under any contract awarded for development and testing of a prototype system will involve access to sensitive security information (SSI) and/or classified information up to the level of CONFIDENTIAL.  The contractor shall ensure that all appropriate security and protection actions are taken.  A DD-254 will be included in the contract at time of award.
Data collected pursuant to any subsequent contract and other relevant Government-sponsored activities, will be Government property.  Specifically, the Government will have unlimited rights to all raw and reconstructed image data and hardware configuration information to allow image reconstruction. Government data rights will include the right to use, reproduce, and distribute such data to third party software algorithm developers.  The Government will accept reasonable protections regarding transfer of data to third parties.
1.8	Laboratory Assessment Data and Results
Laboratory assessment data and results have been determined to be "Sensitive Security Information (SSI)" and may be classified in accordance with appropriate Government Security Classification Guidance documents. United States citizenship is a prerequisite to receiving SSI. 
Companies will be given access to data collected during their systems laboratory assessment, but not the results of the Governments assessment of their system.  Prior to receiving a copy of the TRD or laboratory assessment data, individuals must submit a signed copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that accompanies this RFI.
The Government will provide a technical briefing to contractors at the conclusion of laboratory assessment.
1.9	Information Requested
At a minimum, white papers submitted in response to this RFI should address each of the following topics:

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	One year (extension optional) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Central Asian Republics, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

Asia

The Asia Bureau of USAID provides overall leadership for Agency programs in the Asia region and assistance to over 20 countries spanning much of the globe and nearly a third of its population.  This includes programs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in response to urgent foreign policy priorities; urgent reconstruction programs in Asia in response to natural disasters (tsunami, earthquakes); large and politically sensitive efforts in India, the Philippines and Indonesia; and volatile conflict and post-conflict situations in Cambodia, East Timor, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.  

The Asia Bureaus Office of Technical Support (ME/TS) is responsible for providing leadership and technical support on development issues in the region through analysis, strategy development, program design, technical assistance and information dissemination.  ME/TS guides the Bureaus strategic thinking in technical areas, reviews performance by operating units, and advises on the appropriate allocation of resources to them.  Within ME/TS, the Bureau Environmental Officer (BEO) is responsible for assuring that Asia strategies and programs comply with the mandatory requirements of the Agencys environmental procedures (22 CFR 216; aka Reg. 216), as well as with legislative and policy mandates on the environment (e.g., the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), USAIDs environmental policy directives; and the Foreign Assistance Act as amended in Sections 117, 118, and 119.

The environmental compliance workload is daunting.  In FY 2007, the Asia BEO reviewed and processed over 200 environmental compliance documents for over $8.5 billion in Life-of-Project funds.  This included Environmental Assessments for over $3 billion in infrastructure and other Asia activities.  Given the high visibility and strategic sensitivity of many of these programs, both careful review and rapid turn around are mandatory.  Ensuring appropriate environmental review and providing assistance with Reg. 216 compliance have emerged as important areas of backstopping for ME/TS.  

Central Asia Regional Mission/(USAID/CAR)

With more than half of the worlds population, Asia faces intensifying demands on environmental systems, natural resources, and government capacity as a result of rapid urban and industrial growth, ineffective policies, and pervasive poverty.  Improving environmental governance, resource protection, biodiversity conservation, urban development and water resources management are urgent needs across the region.  

While diverse in many ways, Asian countries and cities face similar challenges in the urban environment and governance that can be addressed through regional cooperation and assistance.  The initiatives throughout the region provide important platforms for sharing and replicating experiences, technical innovations, and expertise; and for improving cooperation between Asian countries, cities, and communities.  Regional cooperation, combined with resource leveraging, is key to catalyzing change in all sectors.   Institutional capacity and regulatory policies must be greatly strengthened region-wide to ensure compliance, enforcement, market-based incentives, public participation, and the resolution of conflict in a manner that is democratic, transparent, and fosters the rule of law.

B)  Basic Functions of the Position

As a member of both ME/TS and USAID/CAR environment teams, the Regional Environmental Advisor (REA) for Asia, based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, provides specialized policy, strategic and technical advice in the areas of environmental review and impact assessment and environment sector programming in Asia.  The REA will support USAID Missions in South, Central, and East Asia and their implementing partners, host country national governments, and, as appropriate, other USG agencies (i.e., Department of State, OPIC, TDA, ExIm Bank, DOI, Treasury, EPA, USDA/USFS, DOE) and regional and international organizations that are active in Asia.  Eighty percent (80%) of the REAs time will be spent supporting USAID programs in the region and up to 20% supporting the Environment Team of USAID/CAR.  The REA's areas of assistance include USAID environmental procedures; environmental impact assessment, monitoring, and mitigation; strategic planning; program development and monitoring; and managing for results.  The position is supported by the ME/TS office as well as USAID/CAR.

C)  Duties and Responsibilities

ME/TS

The Regional Environmental Advisor  Asia supports USAID Missions and partners as well as USAID Mission Environmental Officers and staff in complying with USAID environmental regulations (22 CFR 216), policies, and procedures; and in incorporating principles of environmentally sound design and best practices in planning and implementation of development interventions. 

In particular, the REA shall perform the following services as required by ME/TS:

1.	Assist USAID Mission Environmental Officers, Assistance Objective team leaders, and implementation partners in the preparation of Initial Environmental Examinations, Requests for Categorical Exclusions, EA Scoping Statements, and terms of reference for Environmental Assessments of USAID-funded activities;

2.	Working under the guidance of the Asia BEO, conduct environmental portfolio reviews and periodic site visits for USAID activities to monitor compliance with all USAID environmental procedures and regulations, with particular attention to implementation of monitoring and mitigation measures specified in IEEs and EAs.

3.	Support streamlining, harmonization, and standardization of Reg. 216 procedures in the Asia region, particularly with respect to environmental screening and review under umbrella NGO programs;

4.	Prepare an annual summary of the status of each mission as it relates to satisfying USAIDs environmental requirements and recommend, if warranted, actions  necessary for compliance;

5.	Assist Mission Environmental Officers to prepare reports related to overall Environmental Compliance, Tropical Forestry, and Biodiversity that may be required as part of USAID annual reporting and /or strategy preparation;

6.	Train, or lead and organize teams that train, USAID mission staff, host-country government, and civil society personnel in environmental impact assessment procedures and USAID environmental regulations with a view to strengthening local capacity within USAID Missions and partner institutions for assuring the environmental soundness of development programs.

7.	Promote coordination and collaboration in regional environmental programming and planning among USAID Missions in Asia. Represent USAID/CAR at meetings, workshops and conferences organized by various organizations, including other donors and international organizations.

8.	Develop effective working relationships with USAID personnel, host-country authorities, international donors (including MDBs and the GEF), regional and international development organizations, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and private sector groups within Asia in order to improve overall environmental program coordination.

9.	Develop, or lead/participate in teams that develop, environmental profiles and other analyses of major environmental issues in Asia if/as requested by the USAID/CAR   Director or Program Officer and/or the Asia BEO.

10.	Collect and disseminate information on best practices for environmental management of selected classes of activities; environmental technologies; environmental laws and regulations; and lessons learned among USAID Missions in Asia, AID/W, NGOs, MDBs, and regional organizations.

11.	As requested by the USAID/CAR Program Officer and the Asia BEO, monitor and assess the environmental impacts of key investments of the Multilateral Development Banks (World Bank, IDB, CAF), other USG Agencies (OPIC, TDA, ExIm Bank) and the U.S. private sector in Asia.  This work will be coordinated with the environment staff in USAID's Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade in Washington. 

USAID/CAR

1.	Assist the Mission Environmental Officer by advising Mission staff on the development of Initial Environmental Examinations and overall compliance with Reg. 216 requirements.  

2.	Provide strategic direction to contractors and grantees to ensure their activities support the strategic framework objectives of USAID/CAR to ensure compliance with established USAID guidelines, policies and procedures.

3.	Coordinate activities with appropriate personnel at the USAID/CAR, USAID/Washington, USAID Missions, US Embassies and other US government agencies, such as the US EPA.  Wherever possible, ensure USAIDs regional initiatives complement bilateral activities.

4.	Develop, maintain and strengthen working relationships with key partners, including national ministries, local governments, international organizations and other donors, private sector, NGOs, universities and the media to identify and implement efforts to increase synergy among the key stakeholders.  These contacts are at the senior management level.

5.	Prepare and disseminate, on a regular basis, to Mission staff, USAID/Washington, and program partners information on issues, accomplishments and worldwide best practices in environmental impact assessment and environmentally sound design.  Document success stories in improving environmental governance.

6.	Provide briefings to visitors to the USAID/CAR and to the press on the environmental impact assessment and environmental governance in the region and USAIDs programs in this area.  Prepare and deliver presentations on the same issues to regional and international workshops and conferences. 

7.	Represent the USAID/CAR at meetings, workshops and conferences organized by various organizations, including other donors and international organizations.

D)  Supervision and Relationships

USAID/CAR and ME/TS will jointly provide technical and programmatic supervision.  USAID/CAR will take the supervisory lead on host mission activities while the Asia BEO will take the supervisory lead on environmental compliance (Reg. 216) responsibilities.  The REA reports to both the USAID/CAR Program Officer and the Asia BEO, and uses professional judgment and skills to plan and carry out assigned activities, projects, or other assignments.  S/he develops recommendations to solve difficult problems without precedent, proposes solutions to complex issues and discusses recommendations with his/her technical supervisors.  S/he is considered the lead authority for the Missions and an Agency expert on environmental review and compliance procedures and evaluation issues.  The work is technically authoritative and almost always accepted without substantive change and is only reviewed for conformance to Agency policy.

The Regional Environmental Advisor (REA) for Asia will be physically located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, but co-funded by ME/TS and USAID/CAR.  Consequently, there must be close collaboration between the USAID/CAR Program Officer and the Asia Bureau Environmental Officer (ME/TS) to ensure: accountability, service to the host and client missions, day-to-day supervision, and adequate backstopping.  To achieve this, management responsibilities of the host Mission and ME/TS are:

1.	The host mission (USAID/CAR) will provide day-to-day supervision and logistical support, while ME/TS will provide overall technical and policy guidance, and will coordinate and prioritize regional Reg. 216 backstopping responsibilities (in coordination with the host Mission).

2.	Annual work plans with regular updates are required and will be approved by the host Mission and the Asia BEO.  These work plans and updates will be prepared in close consultation with client bilateral Asia Missions.

3.	Quarterly reports, including individual trip reports, will be submitted to both the USAID/CAR Program Officer  and the Asia BEO.

4.	Annual performance evaluations will be coordinated by the host Mission with input from the Asia BEO and the client bilateral Asia Missions.

5.	In exchange for the above described management services, the host Mission (USAID/CAR) can expect up to 20% of the Advisor's time to be spent in its service with the remaining time spent serving other clients, especially bilateral Asia Missions.

6.	The incumbent will be required to travel to other Asia countries, Washington, D.C., and other localities in the performance of his/her duties.  It is anticipated that approximately 50 % of the incumbent's time will be spent traveling to other countries in Asia, with occasional trips to AID/W for consultations.  All travel shall have the prior approval of the USAID/CAR Program Officer, or his authorized designee.

<DESC>Sources Sought<BR>Integrated Modular Medical Support Systems (IMMSS)<BR>Posting Date: 12 August 2008<BR>Closing Date: 29 August 2008, 4:00 pm CST<BR><BR>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The Huntsville Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will select firms for the provision of modular medical systems furniture and associated services for various medical facility, medical research, and medical laboratory projects to award Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC).  The contracts addressed by this notice will provide products and services worldwide.  The contracts are anticipated to be used for projects in support of U.S. Army medical facilities, the U.S. Army Health Facility Planning Agency (HFPA) and other approved customers.  Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and professional qualifications for the required work.  The Government anticipates award of three (3) to five (5) ID/IQ contracts, each with one base year ordering period and four one-year options.  The total amount of each contract over the five year ordering period is expected not to exceed $50,000,000. The program capacity shared by all awarded contracts will be approximately $230,000,000.  Historically, this work has resulted in task orders ranging from $5,000 to $500,000.  The selected firms must be able to execute at least ten simultaneous task orders ranging in value from $5,000 to $5,000,000.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  The initial contract is anticipated to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2009. <BR><BR>The Huntsville Center, Corps of Engineers, intends to solicit and award multiple indefinite delivery contracts for modular medical systems furniture and associated services.  The Government is performing market research in order to identify all interested businesses, both large and small, and to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute the requirements within this acquisition. Respondents need to indicate all small business designations (small business, 8(a), certified HUBZone and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned).  Interested firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to submit a capabilities statement form as discussed below.  Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part of the acquisition, if any, will be set-aside for small business competition.<BR><BR>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The US Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Alabama (CEHNC) has a $230 million requirement over the next five years for the provision of modular medical systems furniture, identified as Integrated Modular Medical Support Systems (IMMSS), and associated services to Government medical facilities throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and possessions, and various overseas locations. IMMSS is comprised of modular furniture product lines with components that are reconfigurable and interchangeable within each product line.  IMMSS was initially developed and provided to the Government by Herman Miller for Healthcare under an expired negotiated Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with MEDCOM Contracting in 1996 and further provided to the Government under a follow-on sole source ID/IQ contract in 2005. Herman Miller is currently the sole IMMSS contractor.  Other manufacturers also provide systems to MEDCOM facilities outside the IMMSS program.  The Government is currently performing market research to determine if there are other vendors who are capable of performing the IMMSS requirements. The basic requirement is to provide integrated modular furniture systems for the healthcare environment that are easily interchangeable and reconfigurable with a high percentage of reuse.  Systems shall include both healthcare environment specific applications and features as well as office applications features.  Healthcare and office systems components within a product line shall be physically and architecturally compatible and interchangeable.  Systems and components for healthcare environments should be able to be cleaned using a cart washer, wand-washed or steam cleaned.  Systems shall generally be in compliance with MIL-STD-1691, which can be found at http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_org.php?o=24.  Required systems include applications for examination rooms, treatment rooms, nurse and reception stations, pharmacies, laboratories, dental clinics, offices, administrative and logistics functions, waiting areas, veterinary clinics, research, classroom/training, and other related functions in medical facilities.  Physical integration and/or compatibility with existing Herman Miller IMMSS systems, or systems made by other manufacturers, can be required.  It is anticipated that approximately 50% of the work will require architectural and/or physical integration with existing Herman Miller IMMSS systems.  The remaining 50% of the work will not require integration with existing Herman Miller IMMSS systems.  A small portion of the remaining work may require integration with systems made by other manufacturers, but most is expected to be initial outfitting of facilities or areas that will not require integration with existing systems.  Associated services will include design, delivery/transportation, installation, minor facility renovation or repair work performed during installation, maintenance, reconfiguration services, restorative services, panel fabric replacement services, clinical analysis services, extended project management services, inventory services, warehousing services, product orientation training, etc. The contractor will be required to have knowledge and experience with patient centered design principles, evidenced based design, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). <BR><BR>3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<BR>The decision to reserve award(s) for qualified small business under a multiple award acquisition is being considered pending the evaluation of responses to this sources sought announcement.  The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 337214 (Office Furniture (except Wood) Manufacturing) either singly or as part of an assembled team.<BR>A capability statement has been posted to http://www.hnd.usace.army.mil/engr/IMMSS/Default.aspx for your use.  Interested firms should go to the website and download the capability statement.  The capability statement should then be completed and returned no later than 29 August 2008, 4:00 p.m. CST, via email to Contract Specialist, Lillian T. Fox and Contracting Officer, Tonju L. Butler at DLL-CEHNC-IMMSSPREAWARD@usace.army.mil.  All completed capability statements received will be analyzed in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts. The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified interested firms is significant enough for a restricted competition under the authority of any small business procurement program identified in FAR 19. If after review of all responses, the Government determines that there are not enough qualified firms to perform this requirement, the Government may solicit the acquisition as an unrestricted requirement to be procured under full and open competition procedures.  <BR><BR>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will NOT reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.<BR><BR>NO HARDCOPY OR FACSIMILE SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Cover letters and extraneous materials (brochures, etc.) will not be considered. Any questions concerning requirement should be submitted electronically via email to the Contract Specialist, Lillian T. Fox and Contracting Officer, Tonju L. Butler at DLL-CEHNC-IMMSSPREAWARD@usace.army.mil. <BR><BR>Personal visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be scheduled.  THIS is NOT a REQUEST for a PROPOSAL.

<DESC><p><br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES FOR MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
<p><br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>To significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of notifications for the 48th Fighter Wing leadership and base decision makers.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Command Post currently does not possess a mass notification system. The current system in use by the Command Post is a web-based system capable of reaching only SMS capable devices (SMS cell phone, pager, PDA, email). The system is very time consuming and labor intensive to input data. Further, the system does not offer feedback capability to inform the sender of who was contacted. Finally, the current system is fee-per-call based which would generate significant costs if used daily for base-wide notifications.</p>
<p>According to USAFEI 10-207: "The maximum number of initial calls will not exceed seven per controller". The Command Post has numerous scenarios requiring seven or more notifications per controller. Without mass notification capability, this requirement can and has extended notifications in excess of twenty-five minutes. This in turn delays vital information reaching key decision makers and leads to inaccurate reporting of information.</p>
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The 48th Fighter Wing Command Post desires to create and execute a strategy to vastly improve notification efficiency and accuracy in regard to events or incidents affecting the installation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>While Offerors have complete flexibility to propose their own solutions, their proposed Contract Work Statement must include a comprehensive strategy for achieving the following objectives:</p>
<p><br />&bull;System Capabilities / Requirements:</p>
<p>System must have the capability for the creation and storage of numerous pre-canned scenarios (100+)</p>
<p>Must have capability to use existing telephone system. Must not use a remote call center with charge per call fees.</p>
<p>Must have capability to contact numerous electronic devices (cell phones, SMS, pager, fax, home phone, email, and PDAs).</p>
<p>Must have capability to send multiple notifications simultaneously.</p>
<p>&bull;Feedback / Reporting:</p>
<p>Must have feedback capability to report who was and was not contacted.</p>
<p>&bull;Installation Requirements:</p>
<p>System must be Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified to operate on Air Force telephone systems/networks (AFI 33-111 Voice Systems Management paras 7.9 and 9.1.2.. and Attachment 6).</p>
<p>System must be a system approved by the Air Force Communications Agency's and DISA's DITSCAP/DIACAP system prior to use on Air Force network (AFI 33-202 Volume 1 Network and Computer Security, Chapter 6).</p>
<p>System must be able to interface with the standard desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>System must be able to operate on Air Force standard network architecture and not use excessive bandwidth.</p>
<p>&bull;Training:</p>
<p>Must provide initial notification scenario set-up assistance and training.</p>
<p>&bull;Maintenance:</p>
<p>Must have capability to be maintained by local communication support function (Comm Sq, CP, etc.)</p>
<p>Must have 24hr customer support service offered by provider.</p>
<p>Offer per incident rates for system service calls rather than annual service agreement.</p>
<p>Solution must minimize recurring costs for the life of the system. Price proposal must include future software upgrades and maintenance for a five year period following installation.</p>
<p>&bull;Not required but desired:</p>
<p>Capability to send notifications to individual desktops.</p>

<CONTACT>Jamie Sclafani, Phone 513-487-2045, Email sclafani.jamie@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Purdue University.  Contractor services are needed to sample water, soils, and manures at the Purdue University Animal Science Research and Education Center (ASREC) that have been amended with manures or lagoon/manure pit effluents of cattle, swine, and poultry in order for the EPA to analyze and evaluate concentrations of fecal bacterial indicators and pathogens including Escherichia coli, enterococci, Salmonella sp., and E. coli O157:H7 as well as the variability of host-specific PCR biomarkers for fecal pollution in tile drainage and upstream and downstream of agricultural fields.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide weather data for the Purdue University ASREC as well as flow data on Marshall Creek and contributing drainage tiles at the sampling locations.

EPA research indicates that Purdue University is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because the Purdue Animal Sciences Research and Education Center site uniquely provides access to barns and livestock animals for fecal sampling, livestock manure management/treatment system and land applicators or spray irrigators for sampling land-applied manures and lagoon effluents, the agricultural crop fields for soils sampling, and access to Marshall Creek and it's contributing tile drainage outlets for bi-weekly and rainfall-associated flow sampling.  Complete control over all of the fields adjacent to the stream is critical to ascertain the information on application practices and rates to affect a mass balance in the system.  Purdue University holds the exclusive right to work within their own facility which contains the conditions paramount for the success of the study and that are not duplicated by any other midwest Combined Animal Feedlot Operation.

Any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPAs requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days (before August 27, 2008 at 12:00 PM EST) of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541712.  Documentation should be submitted to Jamie Sclafani at sclafani.jamie@epa.gov.

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information		   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information		   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

<DESC>This is a combined commercial synopsis/solicitation, (HSFEEM-08-Q-0062) supplemented with additional information included herein (SOW Attached). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes, as a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms for up to a total of 1,666 room nights for participants attending the GPD National Conference. DHS/FEMA has tentatively scheduled the conference to occur the week of  December 15, 2008, with some attendees arriving beginning Sunday, December 14, 2008. The preferred conference pattern is to have the official conference days as Tuesday/Wednesday; alternate:  Wednesday/Thursday.  The accommodations will require lodging beginning 12-15-2008, through Wednesday, 12-17-2008, or 12-16-2008, through 12-18-2008, depending upon the actual established dates based on hotel space availability.  The room block pattern is attached in the SOW/Details. Meeting room, breakout facilities, and business office accommodations are also required (See Attached SOW/Details). The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be in the Washington DC metropolitan area as defined as being not more than (10) miles outside the District of Columbia, and must be capable of offering facilities capable of accommodating up to 1200 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 21 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the GPD National Conference, and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. The Government will provide the hotel/motel a list of the expected participants/attendees. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to pay for their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. Any state or local participant (attendee) requesting an earlier arrival or later departure than listed below, shall be personally responsible for payment. The "Grand Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which the conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotels standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms should be structured in a fomat that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offerors standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and  the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the JTR guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its entirety from the resulting order. Offerors should also provide an copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest cost offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotels standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotels accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated.  The per night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Joint Travel Regulations. If possible without exceeding the JTR maximum nightly room rate, it is highly desired that offerors include the cost of the refreshments as part of the per night room cost (See Attached SOW/Details Discussing Refreshments). Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the three (3) night periods separately, and a Grand Total for the entire period.  In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be the best-value to the Government.  The quotation packages will be evaluated as a best value award using trade-offs between technical and cost factors in determining which offeror best meets or exceeds the Governments needs.  The evaluation factors are as follows: 
(1) The offeror must demonstrate ability to provide the requested number of guest rooms/nights and associated conference facilities as described in the SOW on the dates indicated; (2) The offeror must be within (10) geographical miles of the District of Columbia; (3) The offeror must be in compliance with the  Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act .  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions  apply to this procurement:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructional to Offeror-Commercial Items, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. In compliance with FAR 52.212-5, the following additional clauses are incorporated as part of and apply to this acquisition:  52.203-10 Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity, 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns, 52.222-6 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.225-3 Buy American Act-Supplies.

<CONTACT>Luke, Kimberly B.        703-787-1070,   kimberly.luke@mms.gov

<a href="mailto:kimberly.luke@mms.gov">Luke, Kimberly B.</a>
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  A copy of the RFQ may be obtained by sending an email to Kimberly.Luke@mms.gov with your company name, address, DUNS number and point of contact information.
Project Background - MAG-PLAN was developed on the Microsoft Access platform and provides MMS an integrated framework for using IMPLAN multipliers to estimate the regional macro-level socioeconomic impacts in one model.  (Note: IMPLAN multipliers are the coefficients used in the input-output analysis based on inter-industry relationships to calculate the direct, indirect, and induced impacts.  In simpler terms, they estimate the ripple effects that occur throughout the economy after any new initial spending.  More information can be found in the IMPLAN Pro Users Guide or at www.implan.com.) In the broadest terms, MAG-PLAN consists of two stages and requires an MMS-developed Exploration & Development (E&D) scenario to run. E&D scenarios are MMS estimates of the oil-and-gas-related activities that are likely to occur as the result of a proposed action such as a lease sale or collection of lease sales.  The first stage of MAG-PLAN estimates the level and allocation of expenditures resulting from anticipated OCS oil and gas projects based on the activities specified in the E&D scenario.  In this stage, MAG-PLAN uses existing data to translate the E&D-specified level of each kind of activity (e.g., drilling an exploratory well, constructing and laying a mile of pipeline, or operating and maintaining a production facility for a year) into expenditures.  It then allocates these expenditure estimates among several hundred industry sectors (NAICS-based IMPLAN codes), and distributes the resulting sector-specific expenditures among user-designated Onshore Areas (OSAs).(Note: Technically, MAG-PLANs first-stage, direct spending estimates include what traditionally would be considered the first round of indirect spending.)  The second stage of MAG-PLAN estimates the ripple effects of that spending on each OSA, using IMPLAN multipliers to estimate the economic output, employment, and other economic effects.
Project Objectives - The purpose of this solicitation is to assemble a group of 3-6 consultants that would provide expert advice to MMS employees concerning the updating of MAG-PLAN data and operations.  
Qualifications - Membership of the Modeling Review Board will reflect the depth and range of knowledge useful for guiding these studies to update the two MAG-PLAN models.  Applicants will be selected based on the depth, range, and relevance of their educational backgrounds, their industry and/or research experience, and their areas of expertise as well as on the range of expertise required for the Board itself.  Each board member must demonstrate one or more of the qualifications listed at the end of this paragraph.  Applicants should submit documentation (such as a written narrative of several paragraphs describing the experience or copies of research papers) for at least one qualification listed below.
1. In-depth understanding of the offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico.
MMS is looking for extensive experience working for, consulting for, or studying/ analyzing the offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico, especially in regard to activities that generate high levels of spending, such as drilling or platform fabrication.  An understanding of support industries would be helpful.
2. In-depth understanding of the activities necessary to discover, develop, and produce oil and gas on the Alaska OCS and to transport it from the production site.
MMS is looking for extensive experience working for, consulting for, or studying/ analyzing oil and gas activities in Alaska, especially in regard to activities that generate high levels of spending and to how they might be extrapolated to the nascent Alaska OCS oil and gas industry.  An understanding of supply and support systems/companies would be helpful..
3. Experience working with offshore oil and gas industry expenditure/cost data and data sources.
MMS is looking for guidance on the best ways to obtain data as to how much a company is likely to spend on a particular activity (e.g., drilling an exploratory well or fabricating and installing a platform), the sectors that supply the required goods and services, and the onshore geographic locations that supply those goods and services.  The heart of this qualification is the ability to provide advice as to actual sources of valid and obtainable expenditure/cost data to update and improve current data; therefore, MMS assumes that someone meeting this qualification would know how to obtain industry data directly and/or would have a thorough knowledge of commercially available data from FieldPlan, Ziff Energy, Douglas-Westwood, or other such sources.
4. Experience developing and applying regional economic impact models and experience with advanced applications of input-output (IO) software-data systems such as IMPLAN.
MMS is looking for experience examining the economic impacts of a complex industry at the local, regional, and national level and with adapting IO models to more complex issues, such as creating a spending profile for a new industry that is constructed of various existing sectors.  While this IO experience takes precedence, MAG-PLAN was developed on the Microsoft Access platformwith some Visual Basic coding, and MMS is hoping to include someone who can provide guidance on improving model efficiency.  
REQUIRED TASKS:Geography - MAG-PLAN GOM provides regional economic impact data estimated to reflect likely effects of proposed OCS oil and gas activities in three planning areas:  the Western GOM, the Central GOM, and the Eastern GOM.  These regional economic effects are estimated for primary OSAs, or impact areas, that comprise 13 groups of counties and parishes that cover the entire GOM coast from southern Texas to southern Florida.  MAG-PLAN GOM provides more highly aggregated estimates for the remainder of the five GOM States and for the remainder of the United States. 
MAG-PLAN AK provides regional economic impact information to reflect onshore effects of OCS oil and gas activities in eight Alaska Offshore Modeling Areas.  A significant part of the data was collected from two previous MMS models, called Arctic and Sub-Arctic IMPAK.  These models were built for MMS by contractors using detailed engineering cost estimates for possible oil and gas activities on the Alaska OCS. 
Tasks - For each of the following tasks, member participation will be primarily in the form of written reviews and/or teleconferences.  In-person and/or group meetings may also be deemed useful, most likely prior to completion of the update studies in 2010.  No more than two such meetings will occur in any one year, and there will be a maximum of four such meetings over the life of the contract.  
Task 1. Consult on methodology for MAG-PLAN GOM and MAG-PLAN AK Update/Upgrade Studies-Review existing and proposed methodology -Suggest improvements to proposed methodology
Task 2. Consult on existing data and proposed data sources-Review existing data and proposed data sources-Review documentation of data sources-Suggest modification to ensure data integrity
Task 3. Review Final Reports and Model-Review and test actual computer model for errors and inconsistencies and suggest possible solutions-Review and comment on final contract deliverables received by MMS on the model updates
Task 4. Provide advice as needed after update studies are completed-Respond to occasional questions as to reasonableness of aggregate MAG PLAN estimates for proposed OCS activities in the GOM or offshore Alaska-Evaluate staff proposals to internally modify MAG-PLAN data or operations -Suggest studies, or evaluate study proposals, designed to obtain data for improving or update specific aspects of MAG-PLAN data.
To obtain a full copy of the RFQ, please email Kimberly.Luke@mms.gov.  Telephonic requests will not be accepted. 
Questions must be received by August 15, 2008.  Quotations are due no later than 2:00PM current eastern time August 26, 2008.
The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on the evaluation criteria as set forth in 52.212-5 in the RFQ.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple purchase orders from this solicitation.  Quotes submitted in response to the RFQ will be received in the following manner: via regular mail, overnight courier or hand carried.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price type contract for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services.
BACKGROUND:As a result of the 2002 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Biological Opinion for Lease Sale 184 (Western Planning Area), MMS implemented a Seismic Survey Mitigation Measures Notice to Lessees (NTL).  This initial NTL has subsequently been updated (2003-G08; 2004-G01; 2007-G02) and expanded to include a variety of mitigations and reporting requirements.  As part of the original Biological Opinion that resulted in the seismic survey observer program, NMFS also required that an annual report be submitted documenting all sightings of sperm whales and sea turtles, the species most likely to be sighted currently listed under the Endangered Species Act.  However, sighting reports for all marine mammal and sea turtle species are submitted.  As a result, MMS now has considerable data from the observer program and is in a position to evaluate the data and determine the effectiveness of existing mitigation.  These data would be timely for both MMS and NMFS as we proceed through the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) rulemaking process in the Gulf of Mexico and would also help inform MMS of the effectiveness of similar mitigation and reporting requirements in other MMS regions.PURPOSE:The purpose of this study is to summarize and synthesize submitted seismic survey observer reports for the years 2003-2008.  After synthesis of these data, recommendations will be made as to the effectiveness of required mitigation measures, as well as suggestions for new and/or improved mitigations.Due to the proprietary nature of the reports, this analysis will require close coordination between the contractor and MMS personnel.  Working with previously submitted Marine Mammal Observer (MMO) data, a separate analysis of all three reports (observer effort, survey, and sighting) will be completed.  Data requirements for each of the reports (observer effort, survey, and sighting) can be found in the current NTL 2007-G02.  Characterizations of seismic activity levels, species occurrence and behavior, and observer effort are among the types of data that will be analyzed.  However, the contractor will work with MMS staff to ensure that data summary and synthesis is appropriate.  Synthesis and summary of all submitted seismic observer data will enable MMS and NMFS to adequately characterize past seismic activity in the GOMR, as well as provide information for MMS to fulfill its regulatory mission and comply with NEPA requirements.SCOPE OF WORK:
This project includes the following requirements related to the analysis of seismic survey mitigation measures and protected species observer reports.  Coordination and status reporting at post award, mid-term, and progress meetings.  Development of a data synthesis report.  The report shall include development of a set of analyses relevant to the offshore seismic industry in the Gulf of Mexico that can be addressed using the submitted MMO data. Examples may include: Effectiveness of seismic company versus 3rd party observers (e.g. sighting rates); Effectiveness of current seismic mitigations (e.g. ramp-up, mitigation guns, exclusion zone size, etc.); Detailed summaries of seismic operations by type and quantity; and, Processing Approach, i.e., Methodology and Flow Diagram.  Development of a technical summary, Powerpoint presentation, archival disks related to the data analysis report.  And preparation of scientific manuscript.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Statement of Need
This Performance Work Statement outlines the project requirements to clean (if necessary) and copy approximately 900 UCA  inch video cassettes to Beta SP.  Most of the tapes are unique items and are between 20 to 33 years old.  They are housed at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This is an Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery Order (IDIQ) contract with a guaranteed minimum of 33 UCA  inch video cassettes through September 30, 2008 and a maximum of approximately 900 UCA  inch video that should be copied no later then September 30, 2011 in two option years.   The performance time period may decrease based on shipment size, and Quality Assurance Inspections of completed copies along with original tapes returned to the Ford Library.  (See paragraph 3 below for size and shipping times required)  

2.0   BASIC REQUIREMENTS

The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library is a branch of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  NARA ensures ready access to the essential evidence that documents the rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience.   Daily, the agency meets thousands of information needs, ensuring access to records on which the entitlements of citizens, the credibility of government, and the accuracy of history depend.

The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library houses over 20 million pages of documents, nearly 500,000 photographs, over 750,000 feet of motion picture film, over 2,500 hours of audit tape and more than 2,500 hours of videotape.  The Library performs reference services, including making the records available to individuals for research and furnishing copies of documents from the records to requestors. 

The Library has approximately 900 UCA  inch videotapes.  They range in length from 5:00 to 60:00.  The contractor shall provide estimates for 5,15,30,60 and 90 minutes Beta SP and corresponding S-VHS cassettes.  The breakdown should include the transfer of the cassettes, rates for reference bars and tone; a title tag after the tone; labeling the tapes and cases; cleaning (if necessary); preservation rates (if necessary); and cost of Beta SP and S-VHS Stock in 5,15,30 and 90 minute formats.  The tapes shall be housed in plastic album cases.  The work will be done at the site of the successful bidder. 

In cases where there are multiple cassettes from the same event, the tapes may be combined if instructed to do so by Ford Library Staff.  These will likely be programs originally taped on 90 minutes quad tapes but then broken down to 60 and 30 minute  inch cassettes.  They will need to be recorded to 90 minutes.

(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.


(ii)
(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --
(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(3) It is the only proposal received.
(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.
(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.
(6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.
(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.
(8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer.
(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).
(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) Contract award.
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.
(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.
(End of Provision)

(1) The Contracting Officer immediately shall notify the offeror and permit the offeror to resubmit the proposal;
(2) The method and time for resubmission shall be prescribed by the Contracting Officer after consultation with the offeror; and

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>Description:

 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in
 accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13.

                     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are
being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The North
American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541690.  This is a small business
set-aside.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO SMALL
BUSINESS CONTRACTORS MAY SUBMIT A QUOTE.

The NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) has a requirement
for a service to optimize the performance of the Molecular Measuring Machine
in accordance with the following Performance Work Statement (PWS):


   -----BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT--------

           Performance Work Statement for Molecular Measuring Machine:
           Z-Motion Actuator Assembly
             


I.	BACKGROUND

This procurement is being conducted for the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Precision Engineering Division (PED).

The Molecular Measuring Machine (M3) is a two-dimensional coordinate measuring instrument that uses a scanning probe microscope as the imaging probe and a laser interferometer system to measure feature placement with sub-nanometer resolution over a 50 mm by 50 mm area.  The goal for the instrument is to achieve 1 nm uncertainty for point-to-point measurements.  This requires a stable vibration and temperature environment; error-mapping of the motion guides; and a careful analysis of the sources of error and uncertainty.  The instrument is also contained in a high vacuum chamber.  

The vertical (Z axis) motion assembly for this instrument is a crucial component with many competing design goals that have to be weighed off against each other and optimized.  The Z axis assembly incorporates a coarse motion piezoceramic linear stepping motor; a potentiometer position sensor; a piezoceramic driven, flexure guided fine motion stage; and an integrated capacitance displacement sensor.  It has gone though several design iterations.  The current design is workable, but further research and development and characterization is needed for improved performance.
A journal publication about M3 is available for further background information:  Nanometer Resolution Metrology with the NIST Molecular Measuring Machine, John A. Kramar, Measurement Science and Technology 16(11), 21212128 (November 2005)

II.	SCOPE OF WORK

The purposes of this requirement are:

1.	Optimize the performance of the coarse and fine M3 Z-motion actuators and the Z-axis position measurement sensors.

2.	Characterize the motion errors for the M3 Z-axis motion assembly and develop a full error map and uncertainty statement so that measurements performed with the actuator can be error-corrected and accurately reported;

III.	SPECIFIC TASKS

The Contractor shall provide all labor and supervision to complete the following tasks:

1.	Optimize the range and motion trueness of the Z fine-motion actuator while maintaining acceptable dynamic response.  This optimization shall include:

a.	finite element analysis of key elements, with design optimization for optimal range and dynamic response within material and space constraints.  (A NIST-supplied finite element analysis package is available.)  

b.	shop drawings of parts to be built; assembly.

c.	measurements of the motion range, dynamic response, and motion trueness before and after any design changes to assess performance improvements.

d.	analysis of performance relative to FE predictions.

2.	Implement a capacitance gage displacement sensor for measuring the Z-fine motion displacement relative to the coarse motion device, and characterize its noise, accuracy, and dynamic response.

a.	the capacitance gage shall measure the displacement in the Z-axis, and also the pitch and yaw of the translation.  It shall be calibrated against an interferometer and an autocollimator, supplied by NIST.

b.	the gage shall be interfaced with the M3 control software so its output can be used for real-time control or monitoring of the axis motion

3.	Generate an error map of the M3 Z fine-motion axes.  This error map shall include angular and linear deviation from straightness as a function of position, and shall include an assessment of repeatability and measurement uncertainty.  It shall be correlated to the position as measured by the capacitance gage sensor described in task #2.

4.	Record all work and data collection conditions and parameters in a laboratory notebook which shall remain the property of NIST.  Store collected data from measurement runs on a backed-up NIST file server, file locations noted in the lab notebook.  

5.	Author and prepare manuscripts for publication of research and measurement results in appropriate scientific journals, and deliver presentations regarding the research at appropriate professional conferences.

In performing these tasks, the contractor shall research the technical literature and solicit advice from experts in the various disciplines, as appropriate, in order to ensure best practice and technique.

IV.	DELIVERABLES AND REPORTS

Measurement results from all calibration runs and measurements of trueness, dynamic response, noise, and measurement uncertainty, shall be documented in a laboratory notebook that shall remain the property of NIST.  Finite element and optimization results shall also be documented in the laboratory notebook and available for continuing research.  Electronic data files shall be stored on a regularly backed-up NIST file server, with file locations referenced in the laboratory notebook.  Component designs and shop drawings shall be delivered to, and remain the property of, NIST.


1.	Daily activities shall be documented in a laboratory notebook that will remain the property of NIST.

2.	Weekly oral status reports shall be given every Wednesday and it shall include
the status of the projects and tasks and near term plans and projections. The
weekly orals reports shall be given between the hours of 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.,
per the Contracting Officers Representative.
        

3.	Three (3) Quarterly research reports shall be produced and submitted
within two (2) weeks, at the end of each month period in the contract.

4.	Significant measurements and research results shall be documented in a manuscript suitable for publication as a NIST internal report or in an external journal.  This manuscript shall include procedures, data, and analysis, along with appropriate figures and tables.

5.	When warranted, as determined by the M3 Project Leader, research results shall be presented at a suitable professional conference, for example, the annual meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering.

V.	DELIVERABLE DUE DATES AND/OR PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

Except for the weekly oral status reports and quarterly written research reports, the
due dates for all the other deliverables is the end of the contract period. The order in
which the tasks are to be performed is not a specific requirement.  However, the
progression of the work will be monitored by the TIC to ensure timely progress

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10748, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ)using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size
standard of $11.0 to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the Analysis for Oxidized Amino Acids.  A price proposal is required to perform the analysis in accordance with the Statement of Work.  PART I.  GENERAL INFORMATION. 1)TITLE / INTRODUCTION. The contractor shall develop a quantitative analytical method for the detection of a comprehensive array of oxidized amino acids, including:  3-chlorotyrosine (3-CT), 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (3,5-diCT), 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) and 3-bromotyrosine (3BT) in either tissue samples of the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) or in cell culture samples.  The method shall be based on contractor experience with methods published in the 
literature, and shall include internal standardization using stable isotope-substituted standards.  The contractor shall then conduct quantitative  analysis for the aforementioned oxidized amino acids in cellular and  extracellular samples for the U.S. EPA, National Health and Environmental Toxicology Division, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711.  The U.S. EPA expects to provide a minimum of 360 biological samples over a 2-year period, with options, at the discretion of the Government, to include up to a maximum of 700 additional samples. These chlorotyrosine, nitrotyrosine, and bromotyrosine protein adducts have been chosen for analysis to serve as internal dosimeters of chlorine exposure and as biomarkers of inflammation (Gaut et al., 2002).  3-Nitrotyrosine is formed by the activity of reactive nitrogen species and is 
indicative of NO production via iNOS (Tarpey, et al., 2004).  Chlorotyrosine in tissue has been established both as a relevant biomarker for inflammation (Hazen et al., 1996, 1997; Winterbourn and Kettle, 2000; Chapman et al., 2000; Gaut et al., 2002) and as a dosimeter for chlorine exposures per se (Roberts et al., 2007; Sochaski et al., 2008; Jarabek et al., In preparation).  The results of these analyses for the protein adducts will be used to verify dosimetry model development and as an endpoint to track the pathogenesis of inflammation induced by inhaled chlorine. 2) BACKGROUND.  As with other inhaled reactive gases of interest to the U.S. EPA (e.g., aldehydes, organic esters, acylating [phosgene] or alkylating agents [mustards]), the sentinel effect of inhaled chlorine is irritant and corrosive damage in the respiratory 
tract of experimental animals and humans (Wolf et al., 1995).  Lesions typically show a proximal to distal distribution pattern, indicating that airflow patterns and exposure concentration play a key role in their pathogenesis.  Due to the differences in airway architecture, ventilation rate, and breathing mode across species, characterization of gas uptake and epithelial responses using anatomically accurate computational models is necessary for accurate dose, duration, and interspecies extrapolation.  Dosimetry models such as hybrid computational fluid dynamics- physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (CFD-PBPK) models afford the flexibility to predict different dose metrics and have been instrumental in dose-response analysis for irritants such as ozone and formaldehyde (Kimbell et al, 1997, 2001; 
Overton et al., 2001; Schroeter et al., 2006).  A hybrid CFD-PBPK model has been developed for chlorine (Jarabek et al., 2007).  Because recent studies have established that the mode of action (MOA) for chlorine is oxidative stress mediated by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which forms in epithelial tissues by hydrolysis and downstream biological responses (Martin et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2007), the PBPK portion of the CFD-PBPK model extends the dose description into the tissue phase to address epithelial reactions.  Results for the protein adducts in these tissue samples performed with the analytical method developed for this contract will be used to verify the dosimetry model structure and as an endpoint to track the pathogenesis of inflammation induced by inhaled chlorine. 3)	SCOPE.  The contract requires development of a 
quantitative analytical method for the detection of a comprehensive array of oxidized amino acids, including 3-chlorotyrosine (3-CT), 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (3,5-diCT), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and 3-bromotyrosine (3-BT) as biomarkers of oxidative stress in cellular and extracellular proteins.  The method shall be aimed at analysis of tissue samples of the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) or of cell culture samples.  Oxidized amino acids shall be quantified by LC-MS/MS with internal standardization using  stable isotope-substituted standards or quantitative methods of similar  sensitivity.  Stable isotope-substituted standard amino acids shall be  purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) and used to  prepare the internal standards (Heinecke et al., 1999).  Quantification of the 
biomarkers shall be determined after delipidification and hydrolysis of tissue or cell culture protein samples.  The method for sample analysis shall be  based on contractor experience and published methods in the literature (Gaut  et al., 2002, Rosen et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2005a,b; Shao et al., 2006;  Sochaski et al., 2008), such as by LC-MS/MS using an Ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography module with a Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass  spectrometric detector (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, U.K.) and a reverse-phase column.  Oxidized amino acids shall be detected by electrospray positive ionization-mass spectrometric multiple reaction monitoring with programmed molecular ions.  The contractor shall then conduct chemical analysis of such tissue and cell culture samples for the aforementioned oxidized amino acid 
biomarkers for the U.S. EPA, National Health and Environmental Toxicology Division, Research Triangle Park, NC, 27711.  The U.S. EPA expects to provide a minimum of 360 biological samples over the total 2-year period of performance.  3.1	SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ? BASE PHASE. Specific objectives for the base phase are as follows and shall be accomplished within 6 months of contract award:  Objective 1.  Synthesis of Internal Standards.  A suitable isotopes (e.g., 13C9 and 15N) to serve as an internal standard for each oxidized amino acid shall be synthesized. Objective 2.  Development of Analytical Method for Detection of Oxidized Amino Acids (3-CT, 3,5-diCT, 3-NT and 3-BT) in tissue samples.  An analytical method of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect nanomolar quantities of oxidized amino acids in tissues 
(e.g., LC-MS/MS or GC-MS) shall be developed based upon published methods (Gaut et al., 2002, Rosen et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2005a,b; Shao et al., 2006;Sochaski et al., 2008; Hazen et al., 1996, 1997; Chapman et al., 2000; Crow,1999; Elserich et al., 1996; Heinecke et al., 1999; Ishida et al., 2000; Pietzsh et al., 2003; Van den Berg et al., 1993). Objective 3.  Analysis of Pilot Tissue Samples.  To verify the method and establish its level of detection (LOD) / level of quantitation (LOQ), tissue samples from a pilot study performed by the U.S. EPA shall be analyzed for the specified set of oxidized amino acids.  The tissue samples will be provided by the U.S. EPA.  Tissue sample locations will include four sites in the URT (septal respiratory epithelium, SEP RE; septal olfactory epithelium, SEP OE; lateral respiratory 
epithelium, LAT RE; and ethmoid olfactory epithelium, ETH), and two from the LRT (trachea and lung lobe). 3.2  OPTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL ANALYSES. The U.S. EPA may choose to exercise options to obtain analyses for additional data sets of up to 700.  These analyses will be the same as those developed and conducted in the base phase.  The period of performance for the options is 18 months and the total contract period of performance is 24 months.  Option 1.  (NTE 336 samples).  Analysis of Respiratory Tract Tissue Samples from Acute Exposures to Chlorine. Available to be exercised from 1 month of award of contract.  Option 2.  (NTE 144 samples).

This report should be delivered at the end of the 6-month base phase. Report(s) on Sample Analysis.  The contractor shall submit a report for each set of samples submitted for analysis.  The report shall provide an Excel spreadsheet of the raw data for each analyte as an attachment.  The report shall be due no later than one month from receipt of the samples by the  contractor.  PART III ? OTHER SPECIAL INFORMATION / CONSIDERATIONS AS APPLICABLE.  1)  Schedule.  The development of the analytical method and performance of sample analyses described in this Statement of Work (SOW) are high priority objectives of the U.S. EPA which must be completed as rapidly as 
possible while still providing scientific accuracy and integrity.  The  contractor shall take all steps necessary to ensure timely development of the method and proceed with sample analysis, and shall notify the EPA COR of any obstacles as they occur which may impede the completion of the studies.  The technical requirements section above describes the sequence of tasks to be completed, and the deliverables section above describes the sequence of  reports to be delivered to the EPA. 2) Review and Acceptance.  The U.S. EPA will review each draft report within 30 working days of receipt and either accept the report as final or provide written comments to the contractor.  When written comments on draft reports are made, the contractor shall address the written comments, including any additional sample analysis that may be 
required, and provide the revised report to the U.S. EPA within 15 working days of receipt.  The U.S. EPA will review the revised report and either accept it as final within 15 working days of receipt, or request additional changes.  The only exception to this 3-week review and reply schedule will be when the EPA COR is out of the office during this time period.  In such an event, the 15-business day turn around period becomes 15 business days that the COR is in the office.  The COR will notify the contractor via email in the event of such an occurrence. 3)  Publication Restrictions.  The Contractor may not publish, present briefings or release any material resulting directly or indirectly from work performed under this contract in any conference, presentation, forum, publication or other discussions without the prior 
approval of the EPA COR. 4) Acronyms. CFD ? Computational fluid dynamics; 3-BT ? 3-Bromotyrosine; 3-CT ? 3-Chlorotyrosine; COR ? Contracting Officer?s Representative; 3,5-diCT ? 3,5-Dichlorotyrosine; LOD ? Level of detection; LOQ ? Level of quantification; LRT ? Lower respiratory tract; NHEERL ? National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory; 3-NT ? 3-Nitrotyrosine;  PBPK ? Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetic; URT ? Upper respiratory tract; U.S. EPA ? United States Environmental Protection Agency.  QUALITY ASSURANCE.  The contractor shall submit a written hybrid quality management plan/quality assurance project plan (QM/QAPP) and detailed project plans within 60 days after award.  Upon request by the government representative, the contractor shall allow a site visit to the laboratory. With the method development report 
and each sample analysis report, the contractor shall provide the calibration curve used for analysis of this set of samples.  U.S. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. 1. The U.S. EPA will provide the contractor with a minimum of 3 weeks (15 working days) of notice before shipping or transport of tissue samples to the contractor.  2. The U.S. EPA will provide all biological tissue samples that the contractor shall analyze.  Whenever available sample volume permits, the U.S. EPA will provide larger sample volumes than required so that the contractor can run additional analyses.  The contractor shall hold the residual sample volume in reserve for additional analyses in case of unexpected results or results that may require confirmation.  If desired by the contractor, the U.S. EPA will hold the reserve (residual) volume at its 
RTP facilities.  If the contractor desires this option, the contractor shall bear the cost of overnight shipment of the reserve sample, rather than the U.S. EPA (see U.S. government responsibility #3 below). 3. The U.S. EPA will bear responsibility for sample shipment.  If the contractor is local, the U.S. EPA will provide the local transport by motor vehicle of samples to the contractor.  If the contractor is not within a 30-mile radius of the RTP, or at the convenience of the government, the U.S. EPA will ship the samples via overnight courier (FedEx) to the contractor, to be received Monday through Friday.  All tissue samples will be transported frozen (i.e., ice chest / cooler with frozen samples placed on dry ice or frozen ice packs).  If tissue samples are to be shipped by Fedex, a trial shipment of nontreated tissues 
will be conducted to ensure that the samples arrive frozen and sample vials remain intact when then they arrive at the contractor facility. 4. The U.S. EPA will provide the contractor with estimates of the concentration range to be expected within the biological samples so that the contractor can use this information to construct calibration curves that bracket the expected tissue concentrations.  The accuracy of these estimates will vary based on how much prior information is known about these adducts under investigation and the sensitivity and specificity of the analytical method developed by the contractor.  It is expected that the estimated concentration ranges provided by the U.S. EPA will improve with the refinement and improvement of the hybrid CFD-PBPK dosimetry model. 5. The U.S. EPA will review each draft report and 
will either approve it or recommend modification according to the schedule as described above under Review & Acceptance.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.

            WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

The controller unit for these emitters will be installed in a secured utility closet and will facilitate all emitters via CAT5 cable.<BR><BR>During Physical Security Inspections conducted, it was revealed that discussions conducted inside the SCIF areas have a probability of being heard in areas outside the SCIF in points where a wall shared with the SCIF and an unclear area that adjoined to a window on the outer perimeter of the facility.  Work to be accomplished in this area will be installed in the vulnerable points in the break room and gym where the windows intersect with the shared SCIF wall.  Emitters will be installed in a manner to mitigate or suppress possible discussions in the SCIF areas from emitting into these uncleared areas.

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) does (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) does not certify that--</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p><br /><br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND STATEMENT OF WORK RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING PROJECT ASHE 077377P1 - PURCHASE RECYCLING CONTAINERS</p>
<p>Bin housing will be constructed of a material, preferably wood, that will not warp from inadvertent spills of liquid.</p>
<p>Bin housing will be covered in a blue laminate - the color of blue is to match existing housings located in Area 1 food courts.</p>
<p>Bin housing will be of sufficient size to accommodate a waste bin of such size 100 - 120 liter.</p>
<p>Bin housing will be of sufficient size to accommodate, on the top, a sink, of 6 - 7 inches diameter, flush with the top of the bin housing, and space for the placement of food trays of 13 inches by 18 inches.</p>
<p>Bin housing will be constructed with stays to hold the placement of the food trays on its top.</p>
<p>Waste bins will be provided (100 - 120 liters) with wheels to accommodate the easy removal of the bins from the bin housing for emptying of the waste.</p>
<p>Bin housing will be constructed such that the waste bins (with wheels), when placed within the bin housing, will not obstruct or come into contact with piping from the top-mounted sinks. This will prevent unnecessary damage to the piping from the sink to the drain.</p>
<p>Waste bins will be provided with a retaining mechanism to hold the waste bags in place.</p>
<p>Bin housing will be constructed to have two doors. The top door will swing in and out to accommodate the disposal of waste to the waste bin located within the bin housing. The bottom door will be constructed of sufficient height to accommodate easy removal of the waste bin located inside the bin housing. The bottom door will held with a magnetic clasp.</p>
<p>The top door of the bin housing will be etched with the wording "THANK YOU"</p>
<p>Bin housing will be constructed so that piping from the top-mounted sink will easy flow of the waste liquid to adjacent drains. It is imperative that the contractor review existing locations at the food courts of Area 1 and Area F to properly ascertain construction needs.</p>
<p>Piping leading from the bin housings will need to below grade in the food court in Area F. Therefore, tile work will need to be performed so that the piping can be placed below grade. It is also recommended that the piping leading from each bin housing be connected to an adjacent bin to alleviate unnecessary tile work. Refer to included drawing.</p>
<p>The locations of the bin housings in the Area F food court are as follows:</p>
<p>4 bin housings around the two column where there is a drain - 4 bin housings around each column.</p>
<p>A single bin housing to be located adjacent to the existing fountain drink area. This bin housing will require piping to the drain in a separate fashion from those located around the columns. It is required that the contractor review existing layout to ascertain best method for the construction of the drainage piping from the housing.</p>
<p>The location of the bin housings in the Area 1 food court is as follows:</p>
<p>The 3 bin housings will be constructed to accommodate existing location of the present bin housings.</p>
<p>It is required that the contractor review existing layout to ascertain best method for the construction of the drainage piping from the housings.</p>
<p>Included drawing is an approximation for the dimensions of the needed bin housings. It is required that the contractor review existing locations to properly design and construct bin housings and piping layouts.</p>
<p>16 bin housings and waste bins are to be provided with this procurement. 12 sets of the bin housings and waste bins are to be installed. The remaining 4 sets are to be extras for future needs. Construction of drainage piping and installation is to be included with this procurement. <br />In the piping that they construct , there will need to be an U-trap or S-trap in the line to prevent gases coming back up the line.</p>
<p>Estimated cost for bin housings and bins - 500 euro each for a total of 8000 euro.</p>
<p>Construction and installation - 3000 euro.</p>

<p>FAR 52.219-28 POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (JUNE 2007)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.</p>
<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>
<p>The Contractor represents that it ( ) is, ( ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code _314999_ assigned to contract number _____________.</p>

Conditions

In accordance with FAR Part 12.6, this award is a full and open competition with local preference. Multiple awards are anticipated. Award will be made based upon technical acceptability and price, e.g., technically acceptable, lowest priced. 

Contractors must deliver units in accordance with the product specifications (Attachment 1). Contractors must be able to ensure that the materials used during construction reduce the levels of formaldehyde emission.  Offerors must demonstrate their commitment and ability to furnish, test, and deliver the total number of units immediately available and offered under this solicitation (a minimum of one (1) and up to 200 Single-wide Manufactured Homes) within 7days from the date of the award. The government reserves the right to purchase additional units as required. 

These THUs must be delivered to the two (2) government specified locations in Waterloo, Iowa and Taylorsville, Indiana.  The final delivery location will be determined upon contract award.

The Contractor must meet the aforementioned National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) standards.  These THUs are considered commercially available; therefore none of these THUs will be restricted to any one (1) manufacturer.  

Evaluation for Awards 

The offers will be ranked:  Acceptable or Unacceptable.  

Factor 1, Technical Acceptance:  The Government will compare the offerors photographs and specification sheets for each unit proposed to determine if the unit complies with the criteria contained in Attachment 1.  If all criteria are met, including the contractors agreement to conduct an acceptable NIOSH test, the unit will be considered technically acceptable.  Failure by the contractor to provide sufficient information to make such a determination will render the proposed unit unacceptable.

Factor 2, Price:  Price will be evaluated on price reasonableness and realism. The technically acceptable offerors will be ranked from lowest total unit price to highest.  For offerors within a 200 mile radius from Waterloo, Iowa or Taylorsville, IN, the total evaluated unit price will be the combination of CLIN 0001; Option CLIN 0002; and the average of Option CLINs 0003 and 0004.  In order to provide local preference in making award determinations, for offerors outside of a 200 mile radius from Waterloo, Iowa or Taylorsville, IN, the evaluated total unit price will by the combination of CLIN 0001 times 120%; Option CLIN 0002 times 120%; and the average of Option CLINs 0003 and 0004.  This 20% preference factor will be used for evaluation purposes only.  If selected for award, the proposed price for CLIN 0001 and Option CLIN 0002 will be used.

Award Determination

Award of the contracts will be made by ranking the acceptable offerors from lowest to highest total evaluated unit price.  Based on the number of units proposed by each offeror, the Government will award as many contracts as necessary to obtain a total purchase quantity of 200 units.  The Government reserves the right to make more awards if additional requirements are determined necessary.
Acceptance Testing

FEMA reserves the right to visit each contractor during testing of each unit. Only units that pass the testing will be deemed acceptable for purchase.  All units will have a final acceptance upon delivery to the government designated area.  Contractors of units found to be unacceptable upon delivery, will have the option to make necessary repairs to bring into compliance at their expense.
Logistics Consideration

The contractor is responsible for all logistics to perform this requirement and will remain responsible until final acceptance is executed by the Government.  Final acceptance includes the safe delivery of the units to the designated two (2) staging or delivery points, in Iowa and Indiana.
Facilities 

The contractor will furnish all personnel, equipment, material, supplies and services (except as may be expressly set forth in this contract as furnished by the Government) and otherwise do all things necessary to, or incident to, performing and providing the services identified in this requirement.

(APR 2004)
(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>(2)	The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing.  A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.  Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.
(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.<BR><BR>(g)Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

Various incremental quantities will be solicited. It is currently projected that stock orders only will be issued.  Deliveries will be to various DLA stocking locations.

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS ITEM DESCRIPTION: The complete items descriptions will be available through the DIBBS solicitation link referenced above on the solicitation issue date.

Contracting Office Address:Environmental Protection Agency, Acquisition and Assistance Branch, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., MCC-10J, Chicago, IL 60604
Description:
NAICS Code: 493110   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to procure warehouse services for the management of its equipment and supply inventories located at its warehouse facilities in San Francisco and Los Angeles, CA, using negotiated contracting procedures under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  This procurement is a total set-aside for SBA-certified small business concerns under the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program only.  A separate solicitation will be made available within 30 days from the publication date of this notice.
This requirement is for the management of equipment and supplies owned by EPA Region 9, for use by its Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The contractor will be responsible for providing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week readiness of all materials and equipment in the warehouse in support of the EPA On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) and its environmental response contractor network. The contractor will be required to perform inventory control, track and schedule necessary maintenance according to manufacturer?s recommendations, and allow for one hour availability of vehicles, equipment, or supplies when requested by an OSC. Other than minor maintenance or cleaning, the contractor will not be required to perform scheduled maintenance of equipment or any major cleaning or calibrations. The contractor will use an electronic system already in place to track inventories at these facilities.
The San Francisco warehouse is located within the City of San Francisco and is approximately 6000 square feet. It contains a response vehicle and a trailer, electronic or scientific equipment, and consumable supplies used at the sites of environmental cleanups. The Los Angeles warehouse holds a  vehicle, equipment, and supplies. The warehouse will be at a location to be determined within the Los Angeles metropolitan area and is anticipated to be approximately 6000 square feet in area. 
The contract will be placed by Region 5, located in Chicago, IL, and administered by Region 9, located in San Francisco.  The EPA expects to award the contract on or about September 30, 2008 with the period of performance to begin December 1, 2008.  The contract will be a performance-based, fixed price (with cost reimbursable line items) type of contract.  The contract will have a one year base and four one year options. The majority of work under this contract will be performed at the warehouse locations; some incidental travel in the performance of the contract may be required in the immediate area (post office, etc.).  In emergency situations, as determined by the OSC or PO, it is anticipated that delivery of emergency response vehicles, equipment, and supplies to emergency response locations will be required. 
The contractor will be required to submit all personnel working under this contract for security clearance under HSPD-12 procedures, details of which can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/forum/oct2007/epass.pdf

<DESC>  1. This notice is the third of three Notices made pursuant to FAR 5.205(b) indicating The Department of Homeland Security's intent to continue to sponsor a studies and analysis Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The typical role of the proposed FFRDC is to help DHS address its most critical issues by providing independent and objective analyses for strategic resource & support planning particularly in those areas that cut across multiple operating components of the Department, operational assessments including operational test & evaluation support, systems evaluations to include development of measurable performance metrics, and technology evaluations.
 2. By The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296, as amended) Section 305, Congress authorized DHS to establish one or more FFRDCs to assist DHS in formulating and addressing important homeland security issues, particularly those where scientific, technical, and analytical expertise is involved. 
 3. DHS will be the ultimate sponsor of this studies and analyses FFRDC; however, the Science and Technology Directorate (DHS (S&T)) should be viewed as its primary sponsor. In general, the DHS (S&T) will provide technical quality, business, financial and contractual oversight. The studies and analysis FFRDC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the studies and analysis  FFRDC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the studies and analysis  FFRDC for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS (S&T). 
 4. The studies and analysis  FFRDC Contractor shall provide all required and necessary space, equipment, support and technical personnel (except that as may be Government furnished) to establish, set up and manage the studies and analysis FFRDC. Performance of the studies and analysis  FFRDC management function required under the contract will take place in the Washington DC metropolitan areas, with the exception of assignees to field operations. 
 5. The work to be performed under this contract will involve access to, handling of, and generation of classified information up to, and including, Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). 
 6. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of functions, including:    
&#61607;	Provide independent analysis about the Nations vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of systems deployed to make the Nation safer; 
&#61607;	Provide intra-departmental and inter-agency cross-cutting, risk-informed analysis of alternative resource approaches; 
&#61607;	Develop and deploy analytical tools and techniques to evaluate system alternatives (e.g., policy-operations-technology tradeoffs, etc.), and life-cycle costs that have broad application across the Department;
&#61607;	Development of measurable performance metrics, models, and simulations for determining progress in securing the homeland; 
&#61607;	Provide independent and objective operational test and evaluation analysis support for major acquisition programs;
&#61607;	Develop recommendations for guidance on the best practices for standards, particularly to improve the inter-operability of first responders; 
&#61607;	Assessments of technologies and evaluations of technology test-beds for accurate simulation of operational conditions; 
&#61607;	Support critical thinking about the DHS enterprise and develop analytic tools that can be applied consistently across Department programs; 
&#61607;	Support institutional memory through changes in leadership and organizational structure likely in the standing up of a new Department;
&#61607;	Support system of systems integration that contribute to a larger DHS intra-agency and inter-agency enterprise as well as collaboration with state, local tribal governments, the business sector (for-profit and not-for-profits), academia and the public; 
&#61607;	Provide independent development evaluation and audit support for major programs, including: performance metrics, evaluation criteria, product quality assurance/control, development verification and validation studies at the system and system-of-system level; 
&#61607;	Provide recommendations for standards for top-level Homeland Security systems requirements and performance metrics best practices for an integrated DHS approach to systems solutions; 
&#61607;	Understand key homeland security organizations and their specific role and major acquisition requirements.
 
The intent of the studies and analysis FFRDC is to provide long-term, independent and objective advice to the government, using technical talent that is generally not available inside the government.  The studies and analysis FFRDC will provide support to all major DHS components in an integrative and cross-cutting manner, with other DHS FFRDCs, so that over time DHSs FFRDCs will provide greater synergy, best practices, and lessons learned in relevant areas.  The studies and analysis  FFRDC will operate in a manner that is free of real and perceived conflicts of interest through the rigorous application of corporate firewalls and personnel conflict of interest and non-disclosure agreements approved by the DHS. Corporate entities that operate the DHS National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures center (NBACC) or receive an award to operate the proposed DHS FFRDC for system engineering and development institute (SEDI) shall not be eligible to operate the studies and analysis  FFRDC, so that the DHS FFRDCs may be used to provide independent and objective cross validation as necessary.
 7. This studies and analysis FFRDC contract has an anticipated award date on or about December 2008.  It is anticipated that the studies and analysis  FFRDC will be provided approximately $10M in annual "core" funding but will subsist primarily on task orders from the major DHS operating components. The annual core funding shall be used to develop an annual research plan to address the most critical issues of the Department --particularly those efforts that require a cross-cutting approach to understand issues and formulate solutions. The studies and analysis  FFRDC workload is anticipated not to exceed 200 Staff-years of technical effort (STE) annually. 
8.  DHS requests comments on this Notice of Intent to Sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for Studies and Analysis.  Any comments should be submitted electronically to s&a_ffrdc@hq.dhs.gov.  Comments must be received on or before September 11, 2008.

If providing an equal, please comply with FAR Clause 52.211-6, Band Name or Equal. NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires from Two (2) firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If an Offeror provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing date and time., the Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the offerors. 3. Price. 4. Award will be all or none basis. Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability. Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than price. Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium. The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror. Vendors shall comply with FAR 52.211-6 if submitting other than the Brand Name product.
