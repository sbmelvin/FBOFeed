<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the May 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-09.  The NAICS code is 517910.										
It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure an Internet2 Port Connection from University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland on a sole source basis under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1.

Period of Performance: September 30, 2006 - September 29, 2007 with three (3) additional option years.

A port fee for a redundant connection to the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads consortium (MAX) is required in order for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to communicate and physically exchange Internet traffic with domestic and international biomedical researchers via advanced communication systems in a diverse and robust manner.  This redundant port fee will need to continue as long as necessary into the foreseeable future so that the NLM can continue to communicate with its users and research partners in a more reliable fashion. Many NLM users domestically and internationally access its resources via high-performance connections at their respective institutions which in turn connect with their regional aggregation points which in turn connect to their respective national research and education networks all of which enables continued collaboration and advances in biomedical research and development. This worldwide network of advanced research and education networks and their peering arrangements is the structure by which this happens. The MAX operates, in the Washington, DC area the regional aggregation point for traffic to/from domestic and international destinations.

The main port fee as well as membership fee is already paid to the MAX.  As such, the only available provider of additional backup ports is also from the MAX. The MAX organization, part of the University of Maryland, is the only known provider of advanced high-performance connectivity services to both the domestic and international research and development community and as such is uniquely qualified for this work because of their background, expertise, and peering arrangements with regional, domestic and international research and education institutions, networks and projects.

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  

The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions?Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) (February 2006).

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire on an other than full and open competitive basis, software system design and development services in support of the Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) system of the Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) of the U. S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), Suffolk, VA.  The requirement is for twelve months of services, anticipated to commence 1 January 2007, with two (2) two-year option years.

The mission of JWFC is to provide a training environment where Joint Task Force Commanders can learn to develop and implement joint force doctrine, tactics, and procedures in a realistic facility, using computer-simulated scenarios instead of actual troop deployment.  JWFC supports Mission Integration and Rehearsals for assigned forces, where tactics and procedures are developed and practiced in the event of a real-world crisis.  The requirements of this acquisition focus on the continued design and development of the JTLS system, as well as exercise database tests and technical support during exercise execution.  The JTLS is an interactive, computer-assisted simulation system that models multi-sided air, ground, and naval combat, with the purpose of evaluating contingency operations plans to determine if such plans would in fact accomplish the mission envisioned by military and political planners and doctrinaires.

The JTLS configuration is the only software system that meets the technological requirements of the Joint Training Program mission.  The acquisition is being processed on the basis of Other than Full and Open Competition, sole source to Rolands & Associates Corporation, 500 Sloat Ave., Monterey, CA 93940-3535 under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of providing the required support of the JTLS system, as this firm designed and developed the JTLS and has been the only source that has made continuous functional and system upgrades since system implementaion in 1983. Furthermore, as this acquisition requires the provision to the Government of any and all changes to system software modules, including source code, Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling the Government?s requirements.        

All other responsible sources may submit concise documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required services, as well as financial and technical information.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Furthermore, no contract award will be made on the basis of information received in response to this notice and the Navy will not pay for any information provided.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Such information, if submitted, should be forwarded to FISC Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083, to the attention of John D. Favata, Code 270.2E.  If no affirmative written responses advantageous to the Navy are received by close of business on the twelfth (12) calendar day after publication of this notice, Rolands & Associates Corporation will be solicited, pursuant to FAR 12.203, to provide the required services.  The placement of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract is contemplated, with services performed at the contractor?s facilities and Government facilities located in Suffolk, VA.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 511210 and $23,000,000.00, respectively.

The point of contact for this requirement is John D. Favata, 215-697-9632.  Upon release, the solicitation will be available at the Navy Electronic Commerce Office (NECO) web address: http://neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) and Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will continue to provide highly technical work in producing 10 year estimates of all national past expenditures, 10 year projections on future spending, and special cost and utilization reports--addressing all expenditures on public and private mental health services and substance abuse treatment (MH/SA). The methodology used to develop the estimates and projections will be parallel to those used previously under the Spending Estimates Project (i.e., National Expenditures on Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Treatment, 1991 – 2001, DHHS Pub No. SMA-05-3999) and is produced to be comparable to the overall national expenditures that are produced by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  The SAMHSA spending estimates will also capture and segregate detailed additional MH/SA expenditures and MH/SA providers not included in the CMS National Health Accounts. The Spending Estimates Project requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge. The technical capabilities include: actuarial research and estimation, econometric techniques, projections and forecasting methods, ability to input missing information, understanding of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases (both surveys and claims), detailed actuarial knowledge with the national health accounts, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, and sound judgment about data quality and usefulness. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to improve the spending estimates and the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences. In addition to these technical capabilities, national MH/SA policy expertise is necessary. Such knowledge must encompass a detailed understanding of mental health and substance abuse treatment services, spending, and financing; knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse; as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing. 
To carry out this project the contractor shall accomplish the following: 
A)	Propose and implement a methodology for making 10 year spending estimates and for making 10 year projections that provide for continuity and consistency with previous sets of MH/SA estimates disseminated by SAMHSA. Each year, evaluate produced reports/articles and make recommendations prior to the next round of estimates or projections for improvements in the methodology that has been previously developed. Review of pertinent literature in methods, cost reporting and new or changed national databases is included. 
B)	Develop estimates for at least a ten-year period of national MH/SA spending that parallel the previous sets of MH/SA estimates undertaken by SAMHSA and are consistent with estimates of general health care spending produced by the CMS. This includes utilization of the same categories of payment and service type that are employed in the general CMS Health Accounts estimates. In addition, estimates for these categories should be further disaggregated by the type of MH/SA service and diagnosis (i.e., MH/SA, MH, SA, Alcohol and Drug Treatment). 
C)	Develop projections of future MH/SA spending across a 10 year period.  Forecasting methods available should be assessed for usefulness and blended methods used, if this would provide the best projections.  As the total time period of past estimates lengthens, increasingly sophisticated methods should be possible.
D)	Prepare a variety of special reports integrating financing policy concerns of the current mental health and substance abuse treatment literature and trends, highlighting policy relevant findings.  These special reports will explore cost, service utilization, special populations or other trends to further refine the spending estimates and to explore the factors that affect the trends in spending.  

The anticipated period of performance is a three years with two 1 year option periods. 

The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is March 24, 2006 with proposal responses due April 25, 2006. This solicitation may be obtained in any of four ways; by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20852; FedBizOpps; or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http://alt.samhsa.gov/contracts/index.html.

If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individual identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you, or check the Web Site regularly for amendments which will also be posted there.

<DESC>The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS), 3601 S. 6th Ave., Tucson, AZ intends to negotiate sole source with Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, 7 Loveton Circle, Sparks, MD  21152, for the purchase of a Bactec MGIT 960 instrument system.  The subject instrument system offers the following unique characteristics:   This system is the only known non-radiometric system with full line susceptibility testing capabilities and automatic interpretation algorithms so that antimicrobial drug testing can occur within a timely fashion for patient care.  Automated interpretation is unique and adds to consistency and speed of results as well as limiting clerical errors.  This system provides safety for laboratory employees by elimination of sharps (no needles are used to transfer specimens).  Both OSHA and CAP mandate the elimination of sharps from the laboratory.   The system has plastic tubes to avoid glass breakage.  The tube lids on the MGIT are superior for ease of use.  Both OSHA and CAP safety regulations mandate all specimen containers are made of plastic. The BD-MGIT is currently the standard of care instrument in the United States with its presence in 48/50 public health laboratories and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control; as tuberculosis is a reportable disease it is important for the SAVAHCS laboratory to comply with and meet the current standard of care. NAICS code #334516 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received prior to close of business (4:30PM local time) on September 18, 2006 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS), 3601 S. 6th Ave., Tucson, AZ intends to negotiate sole source with Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, 7 Loveton Circle, Sparks, MD  21152, for the purchase of a Phoenix ID/AST 100 instrument with an EpiCenter data management system.  The subject instrument system offers the following unique characteristics:   The Phoenix System is a unique system that allows for full scale MIC susceptibility testing to detect antimicrobial drug resistance.  This system provides assurance that no emerging drug resistance is developing in patients’ bacterial infections.  Since other robotic systems do not perform full MIC’s (they only perform partial MICS and so drug resistance can emerge and not be detected until full resistance is present), this system uniquely provides the ability to detect emerging drug resistance.  Rapid and full MIC testing is fast becoming the standard of care for bacterial susceptibility testing and this is the only current known system to provide that capability.  Additionally, the method of detection for drug resistance is based on oxidation reduction reactions and not on turbidity as other methods; redox reactions are superior to turbidity for accuracy.  Another unique feature is the interface with the EpiCenter Data Management system which is the industry standard for tracking hospital-acquired drug resistance trends and antibiograms; this system is the only currently available robotic system to enable full compliance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for testing and the issue of antibiograms.  It is also the easiest to use system for compliance with JCAHO regulations that require reduction of hospital acquired infections.  By interface with the VA VISTA computer system, the Phoenix can provide real-time epidemiology for Infection Control and Pharmacy so that we can fully comply with the intent of JCAHO regulations. NAICS code #334516 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>This is a combine synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is RFP 765-6-6928-03.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This is a small business Set-Aside.  The NAICS is 423430 with a business size standard of $42 million.

Background

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a requirement for hardware, software, and services under its three-zone standardization architecture.  This Three Zone Architecture (Internet Architecture) uses Sun Microsystems Servers in a secure and robust manner.  The following applications is written for the Three Zone Architecture - - MODS (Medicare Ombudsmen Data Systems), expansion of enterprise service such as Extract, Transform Load (ETL) using Informatica.  

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest insurance company in the world.  CMS expends $500 billion annually providing for more then 80 million beneficiaries while processing 1 billion claims annually.  CMS manages more than 1/3 of the nation?s healthcare expenditures, which amount to 5% of the nation?s GDP .
In an effort to streamline the CMS Information Technology Services, CMS is implementing IT standards that will reduce overall IT cost, and reduce the number of systems that it manages on a daily basis.  The Information Technology Modernization Group (ITMG) is responsible for the implementation of many of these standards, and to this end ITMG is committed to providing hardware, software, policies and procedures that are standardized on proven technology and industry best practices.

CMS has started down the path of standardization through the publication of major approved architecture documents such as the Internet Architecture, Web-Enable Application Architecture, Enterprise Messaging Architecture, and Application Developers Guide.  Through the use of these documents, policies, and industry best practices, CMS will standardize on these architectures.  Standards, however, are only as good as the policies and procedures that back them up, and thus, specific requirements must be developed to ensure that hardware and software meet these standards.  CMS has adopted a policy statement that Sun Solaris will be the standard Operating System for future business application development through the use of J2EE.  Thus, one of the major Operating System specifications that is now part of the CMS Technical Reference Manual (TRM) is Sun Solaris running on Sun Microsystems Servers.  
Using these policies, procedures, guides, and statements of future direction, CMS has designed and will be adding additional capacity through this procurement, to the Three Zone Architecture using Sun Microsystems Mid range and Enterprise Servers.  The Three Zone Architecture originally designed for Internet application has now been expanded into four (4) unique environments, Production Internet, ExtraNet, Test & Validation and Development.  The purpose of the Three Zone Architecture is to provide physical and logical separation of the Presentation (DMZ Region), Application (Application Region), and Data (Secure Region).  Through the use of firewalls and other security measures, the integrity of the information contained within each Zone (Region) will be safeguarded.  The approved CMS Architecture documents are available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/it/enterprisearchitecture .

CMS continues to expand its Medicare & Medicaid Business Computing Environment (MMBCE) using the Three Zone Architecture established over the past thirty months based on Sun Microsystems Inc hardware and software to meet the continual demands for resources by our business partners and stakeholders.  This acquisition will acquire additional Sun Hardware, Software, Maintenance and Client Solution Services to meet Congressionally-mandated workloads.  CMS has been very successful in meeting previous demands and has successfully implemented over 20 applications within the past year.  This acquisition will procure Storage Area Network hardware and software, Sun Fire Servers, additional Disk Storage, and components to expand the CMS MMBCE.  As CMS has implemented many Medicare Modernization Act applications over the past year there are still more Medicare and Medicaid Business Applications coming to the MMBCE.  With such mission critical applications being implemented on this hardware and all of the inter-dependencies in hardware, software and operating systems CMS requires that an authorize Sun Microsystems company provide the hardware, software, and services for the expansion of the Sun Microsystems environment specified below.

<DESC>The Maritime Administration (MARAD) of the U.S. Department of Transportation intends to enter into a sole source time-and-materials type purchase order agreement with I.M. Systems Group, Inc., for hosting and maintenance of the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) Property Management and Archive Record System (PMARS). The project is follow-on to a previous procurement and will be undertaken as an incremental from previous phases, each building up to the current phase. I. The development of PMARS, as originally conceived, is complete.      A. PMARS is MARAD's official repository of NDRF ship and ship-related property records.        (1) The system contains information on ships from WWII to the present, along with current inventories of ships and ship-related property.        (2) Out of the more than 7000 ships represented within PMARS, only a few hundred remain active--- the large majority having been disposed of over the years via scrapping and other methods.     B. PMARS provides permanent storage for basic data on active and inactive NDRF ships.       (1) While MARAD does maintain detailed ship files for active NDRF ships, inactive NDRF ship files are generally transferred to the National Archives & Records Administration shortly after ships are withdrawn from the NDRF.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) operator to collect CMM data in support of the Space Shuttle External Tank in-flight anomaly testing. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Thiokol, Inc. because the CMM equipment that will be utilized is government furnished equipment (GFE) and requires a significant amount of training and experience in order for the operator to be certified proficient to the level necessary required for the specific tasks.  Currently, ATK Thiokol is the only source with a government certified operator.  Additionally, due to the time and expense necessary for operational certification and demonstration of proficiency required for the Advanced GFE CMM system required for the tasks, selection of another vendor would lead to an inability for data collection in order to support test objectives per the current schedule and cost requirements.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau Budget Division has a requirement for expert services for system administration and support that will meet the needs of the Bureau Budget Division.  The Census BUREAU Budget system is the Consolidated Budget Reporting Application (COBRA).  COBRA is the system of record for project listings and project funding amounts. Preliminary personnel resource information feeds to COBRA from the Commerce Business System (CBS).  Users update personnel resource and enter funding information to transaction screens.  Funding information then feeds into CBS. COBRA allow users to create and route for approval Project Descriptions (PD), Position Listings (PL), Operating Plans (OP), and Budget Planning Documents (BPD) in support of budget formulation and budget execution activities.  Budgets are linked at a project and participating organization level to Census Bureau Strategic Goals and Performance Targets. COBRA was constructed from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and open source components. HYPERION PLANNING with the Essbase database, using Microsoft (MS) SQL Server 2000 database for metadata management, provides the core transactional and reporting functionality.  The HYPERION components include (1) HYPERION Application Link 7.1, (2) HYPERION Planning 3.5, (3) Hyperion Reports 7.0, (4) Hyperion Essbase 7.1, and (5 Hyperion Essbase Deployment Services (EDS) 7.1.  The system is web-based with system components using .NET 2003 web services and Java Server Pages (JSP) on Apache Tomcat, IIS, and Web Logic.  System components, including customizations, are coded in C# and Java.  Job streams are controlled using Vignette Business Systems.  Configuration management is done in Visual Source Safe 6.0.The purpose of this requirement is to provide operational and systems support services to the Budget Division for COBRA.   Incremental addition of new functionality will be done as needed to accommodate user needs.  The objectives of this requirement are to: Provide effective COBRA system reliability and performance for up to 250 geographically separated users?, Provide effective coordination with IT support staff in maintaining Budget COBRA servers, and Provide effective coordination with Hyperion in the maintenance and troubleshooting of the Hyperion components of COBRA.  The expected outcome is that COBRA will function without significant interruption of services and that user needs for budget formulation and budget execution activities will be facilitated.  The contractor shall provide four (4) specific tasks: TASK 1. ON-GOING SYSTEM MAINTENACE, TASK 2. PLAN, MANAGE, AND IMPLEMENT SOFTWARE UPGRADES, TASK 3. ASSIST FUNCTIONAL STAFF, AND TASK 4 PLAN, MANAGE, AND IMPLEMENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), in response to an unsolicited proposal, intends to award to EarthData International Inc., a noncompetitive contract for an Automated Crop Cultivation Assessment Tool using a dual-sided, dual-frequency, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) mapping system.  The development of this tool is specifically called for in the 2006 USDA Budget to test the concept of supporting FSA’s farm program compliance monitoring and to augment the USDA National Agriculture Photography Program (NAIP).  FSA has identified EarthData International Inc., as the only source technically capable of providing FSA the unique crop assessment tool based on their airborne IFSAR mapping system (GeoSAR).  However, companies believing they can meet the stated requirements are encouraged to submit supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested sources must submit demonstrative supporting evidence by fax, or e-mail to the address listed below no later than 15 calendar days from the date of this announcement.  Responses must include technical statements and other material in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the requirements stated in this announcement.  Further, responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Finally, firms should identify themselves as ether a small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541922 which is $6 million averaged annual revenue.  This is a Notice of Intent only and not an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any materials furnished in response to this synopsis.  Submittals furnished will not be returned to the sender.  Send all responses to the attention of John Mootz: john.mootz@slc.usda.gov or Fax at (801) 975-3512.

Background:  The FSA is responsible for administering USDA farm programs involving crop commodity price supports, disaster relief, and assistance for conservation practices. FSA administers farm programs in part by digitizing and maintaining agricultural field boundaries, or common land units (CLU) from digital orthoimagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).  NAIP acquires orthoimagery during peak agricultural growing seasons on an annual basis. CLU boundaries consist of fence lines, waterways, the interface between agricultural vegetative cover and non crop vegetative cover on the surface.  Another key aspect of farm program administration is to verify that agricultural practices are in accordance with USDA program parameters. FSA has performed this verification by using NAIP imagery. The aerial imagery, along with existing program parameters, is viewed in a geographic information system (GIS) at county based USDA Service Centers to show crops and agricultural practices.  CLU boundaries are displayed to assist with identification of farm parcels and area acreages.  If current agricultural conditions cannot be determined from the imagery, due to sub-optimal timing in image acquisition or quality factors, USDA personnel may be required to assess conditions on the ground, which is expensive and time consuming.  The use of NAIP imagery has been very successful in terms of providing current orthoimagery for maintaining CLU boundaries and performing farm program administration.  For most regions of the country, the imagery is acquired within time frames that allow crop/land use verification.  However, in some regions, particularly the southeastern United States, acquisition within specified time windows can lead to the following problems:  (1) Difficulties posed by high humidity and cloud cover characteristic of the southeastern US during the summer months;  (2) Difficulties posed include identifying and digitizing field boundaries through tree/forest canopy or shadows cast due to low sun angle during aerial photo/image acquisition;  (3) Difficulties discerning boundaries between agricultural crops and non-crop vegetative cover that may have similar appearance in natural color or black & white orthoimagery.  Based on information provided from EarthData International Inc., the proposed Automated Crop Cultivation Tool can provide a cost effective solution to these specific problems.

Requirements for test project, titled:
PILOT AUTOMATED CROP CULTIVATION ASSESSMENT TOOL.
Conduct pilot study to determine the feasibility of identifying common crop types from the acquired GeoSAR data sets.  GeoSAR is a dual-sided, dual-frequency, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) mapping system integrated onto a Gulfstream II business jet wholly owned by EarthData International.  The system is capable of collecting data from 40,000 ft at an airspeed speed of over 400kts yielding a net collection rate of over 280 sq km per minute.  The SAR operates at 2 frequencies simultaneously, X-Band, with a center frequency of 9700MHz, and P-Band, with a center frequency of 350MHZ.  The system is designed to produce high accuracy digital elevation models (DEM) through the process of radar interferometry, as well as SAR orthophoto mosaics.  GeoSAR will collect simultaneous, precisely registered X and P Band IFSAR imagery over a single county in Mississippi (approximately 1,000 square miles) during the peak growing season of July 15 through August 31, 2006.  The collection will be timed and carried out to demonstrate that the system can collect during the night and during difficult atmospheric conditions when it is often impossible to collect conventional photography.  EarthData will investigate whether the unique characteristics of the X and P band SAR images can facilitate the collection of certain feature types, such as fence lines, that are not readily visible in standard NAIP imagery.  EarthData will also use the GeoSAR X and P band image data to determine whether the common crop types present in the data sets (Corn, Soy, Wheat etc.) are separable within the feature space defined by the GeoSAR data.  This will allow EarthData to determine whether the GeoSAR can be used as a tool to monitor compliance.  Various parametric and non-parametric statistical classification algorithms will be tried to demonstrate this capability.  The use of precisely registered X and P band, along with height maps for both bands, slant plant imagery, etc. can be combined to provide a higher statistical component for evaluation.  

General Requirements:  (1) Data acquisition capability must support rapid, day or night, all weather, clear or cloudy, data collection utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR);  (2) Data acquisition and delivery capability must support delivery of final products within 30 days of acquisition;  (3) Products must have comparable resolution to traditional one meter orthoimagery and planimetric accuracy to register within five meters to government furnished geospatial control datasets;  (4) Provide pilot study report including orthoimagery products, digital elevation models, associated metadata;  (5) Products must be visually interpretable, with minimal training requirements at the USDA service center level, to delineate and identify multiple features and objects that may not otherwise be discernable on standard NAIP imagery;  (6) Data products must support automated statistical classification algorithms for crop type verification.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

<DESC>The Tucson Drainage Area Project consists of construction of the Park Avenue Basins.  The four basins include three inline basins called Basins 1, 2 and 3, and an offline basin called Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) Basin.  Basins 1, 2 and 3 ar e connected via drainage structures that pass low flows.  The TUSD Basin includes a weir located in Arroyo Chico Channel at the Railroad Wash confluence.  It will drain through a 36-in. pipe into Basin 3.  At the location of the TUSD Basin, the existing at hletic fields and appurtenant facilities will be demolished and new fields will be constructed at the bottom of the basin and a new locker room/classroom/snack bar building, new parking lot, new maintenance building, new field lights, new dug outs, back st ops, batting cage, and built-in bleachers will also be constructed within the basin and its periphery.  The project also consists of modifying the inlet on High School Wash at Park Avenue.  An existing triple box, consisting of a double 7-ft by 4-ft and a single 6-ft by 4-ft RCB crossing Fourth Avenue would be removed and a new double 10-ft by 8-ft RCB would be constructed beneath Fourth Avenue to Eighth Street, where it would confluence with the existing Tucson Arroyo RCB.  Channel modifications consist of  overexcavating by four feet of an existing channel starting from Parkway Terrace to Campbell Avenue.  The channel would be lined with gunite along the invert and the lower four feet (vertical) of side slopes, and backfilled with soil.  The upper side slop es would be lined with articulated block.  The fully entrenched channel would have a 22-foot bottom width, a depth of 8-feet, and 1:1 side slopes.  The existing dip crossings at Norris, Olsen and Plumer Avenues would be lowered to match the new invert elev ations.  The Campbell Avenue crossing would replace a four-barreled 4-ft by 10-ft RCB with a six-barreled 4-ft by 12-ft RCB.  An existing sewer line would be relocated in order to maintain the current elevation.  An existing side drain entering Arroyo Chic o under Campbell Avenue will have to be relocated within the new box.  Five grade control structures would be constructed in the unlined channel reaches.  The structures will be constructed of grouted stone, with a top width of 6-feet, a depth of 6-feet, a nd a downstream 15-foot-long section filled with riprap.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct the bid guarantee amount and provide answers to questions asked on September 8.

On page 43 of the solicitation, revise 52.228-1 (c) to read "The amount of the bid guarantee shall be 20 percent of the bid price or $500,000, whichever is less".  

Question 1.  It is my understanding that no new additional hardware (locksets, closers, kick plates etc...) are to be installed on the 37 animal room metal doors.  Doors are only to be modified.  Is this correct?

Answer:  Amendment 000001 contains an Option Line Item for  replacing doors. If the COR determines a door needs replacing, the replacement effort would include all new hardware, frame and seal per the Attachment 2 specification in addition to the new door itself. The unit price for this option item should include all these costs.

Question 2.  Question #4 of the pre-proposal conference.  Are sill plates and thresholds considered the same thing.

Answer:  Yes.

The proposal due date remains 4:30 pm CST on September 19, 2006.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. David E. Krzysiak, AFRL/IFGA, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-7454, email: David.Krzysiak@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for       concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support future Air Force networking, services, and information assurance requirements in the context of a Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a globally interconnected, interoperable, and secure system of systems for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. Leveraging commercial technologies and the potential for dual use by both the military and civilian communities are two additional aspects of this program. This activity is aimed at addressing the scale and complexity of a GIG which will provide new, end-user, multimedia, information services and support, distributed   command & control, intelligence, telemedicine and similar applications. These services and applications are vital to the Air Force mission to deploy and sustain forces anywhere in the world. To this end, the ability to send a wide variety of data across a global network comprised of communications channels of varying characteristics, in a secure, survivable manner, is of prime importance. An underlying assumption is that DOD communications will be derived from the commercial, national, and international fiber optic cable infrastructure. However, to reach deployed or airborne units, wireless extension of that infrastructure is necessary. Both terrestrial and satellite transmission systems will be required to support this extension capability and will also be inherent components of these deployed networks. In both instances, they will be required to support large amounts of information throughput. Candidate areas of technical research in support of communications networking, services, and information assurance technology for a GIG are: 1) Implementation and novel Extension of High Speed Large Scale Networks:  Effective implementation of networks to support a deployed Joint Forces Air Component Command and below. Efforts should address areas related to security and authentication, survivability and dependability, traffic management and traffic flow control, network management in a virtual network environment, mobile nodes and networks, self reconfiguring, and dynamic routing. Technologies to support network management will provide global management of the entire information infrastructure. Future management systems must provide for this overall management capability. This infrastructure includes numerous resources such as communications equipment, network switching equipment, distributed operating systems, and user applications. Encouraged are new and innovative ideas in management systems technologies including    visualization techniques, network emulation, artificial intelligence, and any other appropriate technology. Also encouraged is technology to provide specific management techniques for heterogeneous network environments, as well as cooperating management entities. Effective extension of network technology developments to provide launch points from high speed networks into highly constrained deployed networks.
2) Interoperability: For interoperability of an increasingly diverse set of transmission systems, work is encouraged but not limited to; development and demonstration of theater (deployed) fiber optic and high bandwidth RF (including satellite links) networking technology for high bandwidth communications between multi-media display systems that provide an interactive, common picture of battlespace to Theater and Component Commanders. The network should be scaleable, modular, survivable, secure, and provide for interoperability with global commercial communications infrastructure. Examples of enhancing the bandwidth capacity are: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), ultra short pulse Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) and a hybrid of such schemes. Examples of devices are: integrated transmitters and receivers, amplifiers, switches (SONET, ATM, Packet), synchronizers, frequency translators, filters, and routers. 3) User Network Services: The goal is to formulate innovative ideas for user services which use high bandwidth global networks, low bandwidth battlesite networks, airborne segments, and combinations of the these, experiment with them, and possibly develop promising ideas into demonstrable prototypes. Future services will provide the capability for day-to-day mission planning/execution in a distributed C2 coalition environment and assist commanders in making critical decisions in heavy stress situations. Past work in this area has centered around interactive, interpersonal communications services (workstation video windows, video conferencing, shared workplace graphics, multimedia presentation, multimedia conferencing, imagery dissemination) that provide the capability of collaboration among distributed users, both fixed and mobile. Also encouraged are new and innovative ideas for communications services which will support emerging technologies such as visualization and distributed virtual reality, and technologies which support new and innovative communications services such as data compression techniques or others. Also encouraged is work addressing the psychology of individuals and groups in the decision making process in distributed military C2 and the definition of new communications services which support that process. 4) Ultra-wide- bandwidth, multi-channeled, air and space-based communications networks on and between platforms:  Efforts should develop and define optical/electronic network architecture, system and subsystem (transmitter, receiver, switch, optical mux and demux, optical amplifiers, etc.) requirements for multi gigabit per second optical/electronic networks on-board air and space platforms and other AF/DOD applications.  Design and develop passive and active optical/electronic chip scale networking components (transmitters, receivers, switches) for Wave-length Division Multiplexing, RF, Code Division Multiple Access, etc. communications. Implement photonics modules for optical/electronic networking architectures utilizing Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) in hybrid and monolithic format.  5) Network Modeling and Simulation: Efforts should research and develop modeling and simulation tools that are trustworthy to predict, with known and characterizable accuracy, network behavior over a broad range of time scales, network sizes and technology composition.  This solicitation also seeks research on appropriate online network measurement methodologies, which in conjunction with modeling and simulation tools will provide the basis for online network analysis and control.   Deliverables should include technical reports, and when appropriate, software and/or advanced technology demonstrations. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: David E. Krzysiak, 525 Brooks Rd., Rome, NY  13441-4505 and reference BAA-03-15-IFKA. This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 08.

TITLE: DYNAMIC AIR AND SPACE EFFECTS BASED ASSESSMENT (DASEA)

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-07-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 22 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Jun 05; FY 07 by 1 Jun 06; FY 08 by 1 Jun 07; and FY 09 by 1 Jun 08.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2008, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Objective: The overall objective of this BAA is to design, develop and demonstrate a capability for continuous effects based assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  This program will employ, exploit and develop as necessary technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide for spiral development and interaction with other ongoing Air Force programs.  Familiarity with  initiatives that are focused on dynamic tasking and effects based assessment, as well as those technologies that are necessary to support these functions (e.g. multi-INT fusion) are desirable.  Specific efforts targeted for collaboration include: 1. the Command and Control Battle Lab's T-BONE  effort which is focused on rewriting the Theater Air Planning (TAP) capability and the Air Operations Database (AODB).  2. The U.S. Air Force Effects Based Assessment Task Force initiative. 3. DARPA's JAGUAR (Joint Air-Ground Unified Adaptive Re-planning) program.  4. AFRL's PANACIA (Predictive Awareness and Network-Centric Analysis for Collaborative Intel Assessment).  And 5. AFRL/HE's AOC Strategy Planning and Operational Effects Assessment Visualization Effort (04-01-HE-04).   In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complimentary activities including test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, and data collection and management.

Background: The current planning process for air operations takes commander's intent and turns it into orders that executing units carry out. Mission data and orders are documented and sent to executing units in a batch-oriented Air Tasking Order (ATO). To counter emerging threats or exploit emerging opportunities, commanders require the means of reacting very quickly. This argues against a batch-oriented process and towards a more continuous process.  In the near future, executing orders might be available in a Dynamic Air/Space Execution Order (DAEO) or in a continuous "streaming ATO".  This envisions a largely continuous process where target queues are dynamically executed as they are built.  Crucial to a DAEO or streaming ATO process is the ability to conduct effects based assessment (EBA).  Assessment activities need to begin well before tasks are executed. During the planning process, assessment requirements are an integral part of the DAEO generation. During execution, assessment activities need to determine the likelihood that the course of action will attain commander's intent. The focus of combat assessment today is on actions rather than effects and results in recommendations concerning re-attacks.  In addition to re-attack recommendations, effects based assessment must look at whether the basic strategy of the campaign or major operation should be changed.  This Critical Experiment will result in a capability for achieving effects-based assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  New processes for effects-based assessment will be developed and evaluated under this initiative.  Technologies to support accurate and timely EBA based on the new processes will be developed.  Effects based assessment methods for a streaming ATO need to be developed.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods for reasoning under uncertainty in a dynamic environment should be explored.  Note, this effort is focused on exploiting multi-INT fusion capabilities, not developing them.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are equal in importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Scientific and technical merit including creativity of proposed solution to the problem, (2) Soundness of offeror's proposed approach to developing and testing dynamic execution and effects based assessment capabilities, (3) Understanding of the dynamic tasking and effects based assessment problem.  This includes the offeror's understanding of current approaches and military doctrine in these areas. (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed cost and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret or top secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret or top secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.


3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Joseph A. Caroli, telephone: (315) 330-4205 or email Joseph.Caroli@afrl.af.mil.

<DESC>RESPONSE  TO QUESTIONS  SOLI CITATION W912C3-06-B-0004 1.	The work hours specified in the contract are M-F 6am to 12m. Is there any possibility of also working Saturdays and Sundays? Answer: The contractor can work on Saturdays and Sundays after proper coordination. 2.	How many inches of lightweight are required for the new drainage slopes at their top elevations? Answer: Section 1.3.1.1. b  Contractor shall Modify roofing system to correct this situation (deficient roof drainage).  i.e. the contractor shall determine the height needed to achieve the slope required for proper drainage.  Construction specs seem to indicate the use of hot asphalt. Could you please specify whether it is hot or cold applied asphalt? Answer: Cold asphalt is a preferred alternative. 3.	Given the climate conditions of PR, we are very sensitive and prone to sudden rainfall at any time during work hours. Even taking the necessary precautions, there is no way to avoid water in the metal deck from filtering down into the spaces. We could p rotect the equipment down below with polyethylene covers, but that still leaves open the possibility of damaged ceiling tiles. Should we add a provisional sum in case that these are affected or should that be dealt directly with the Contracting officer aft er the contract is awarded?  Answer: Refer to paragraph 1.32 in the SOW. 4.	According to Section 01110 part 1.11 all shop drawings will be submitted for approval after contract is awarded, before fabrication. Is this correct? Answer: Paragraph 1.11 states: after award of the contract, and before procurement of fabrication; submit to the Contracting Officer, all the shop drawings. 5.	Can we have the make and model of the A/C that is to be lifted in order to determine the amount of weight, and necessary equipment to perform the work? Answer: A/C is a McQuay Package Unit, Model No.: LCA-360-HN2Y, 30 Tons

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to issue a sole source procurement to U.S. Surgical under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This procurement is to obtain the ForceTriad Electrosurgery/Ligasure Unit.  This energy platform system combines monopolar, bipolar and LigaSure tissue fusion capabilities into one unit.  This is an electrosurgical system intended for open and laparoscopic surgical procedures giving the surgeon a full range of options including electrosurgical cutting and coagulation, bipolar functionality and LigaSure tissue fusion.  It provides faster and more consistent tissue and vessel fusion and constantly makes the necessary adjustments to create permanent tissue fusion.  The ForceTriad system contains a sensing technology control system designed to precisely manage energy delivery, creating a wide range of options for desired tissue effect.  This technology makes 4,000 decisions per second to provide customized tissue effect for each patient’s tissue structure.  It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this equipment to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification, accompanied by supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements, to the contracting officer within ten (10) days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  All responses must be in writing via e-mail to Cheryl.Weidner@med.va.gov or faxed to 412-365-5451.  If no responses are received, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will proceed with the sole source procurement from U.S. Surgical.

<SOLNBR>270-06-0149
<RESPDATE>020906
<CONTACT>Lynn Tantardini, Contract Specialist, Phone 240-276-1508, Fax 240-276-1510, Email lynn.tantardini@samhsa.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 
Project Title: SAMHSA National Spending Estimates Project for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment: # 270-06-0149 

Project Description:  CSAT /CMHS will continue to provide highly technical work in producing 10 year estimates of all national past expenditures, 10 year projections on future spending, and special cost and utilization reports--addressing all expenditures on public and private mental health services and substance abuse treatment (MH/SA). The methodology used to develop the estimates and projections will be parallel to those used previously under the Spending Estimates Project (i.e., National Expenditures on Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Treatment, 1991 – 2001, DHHS Pub No. SMA-05-3999) and is produced to be comparable to the overall national expenditures that are produced by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  The SAMHSA spending estimates will also capture and segregate detailed additional MH/SA expenditures and MH/SA providers not included in the CMS National Health Accounts. 

The Spending Estimates Project requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge. The technical capabilities include: actuarial research and estimation, econometric techniques, projections and forecasting methods, ability to input missing information, understanding of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases (both surveys and claims), detailed actuarial knowledge with the national health accounts, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, and sound judgment about data quality and usefulness. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to improve the spending estimates and the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences. In addition to these technical capabilities, national MH/SA policy expertise is necessary. Such knowledge must encompass a detailed understanding of mental health and substance abuse treatment services, spending, and financing; knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse (MHSA); as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing. 

To carry out this project the contractor shall accomplish the following: 

A)	Propose and implement a methodology for making 10 year spending estimates and for making 10 year projections that provide for continuity and consistency with previous sets of MH/SA estimates disseminated by SAMHSA. Each year, evaluate produced reports/articles and make recommendations prior to the next round of estimates or projections for improvements in the methodology that has been previously developed. Review of pertinent literature in methods, cost reporting and new or changed national databases is included. 

B)	Develop estimates for at least a ten-year period of national MH/SA spending that parallel the previous sets of MH/SA estimates undertaken by SAMHSA and are consistent with estimates of general health care spending produced by the CMS. This includes utilization of the same categories of payment and service type that are employed in the general CMS Health Accounts estimates. In addition, estimates for these categories should be further disaggregated by the type of MH/SA service and diagnosis (i.e., MH/SA, MH, SA, Alcohol and Drug Treatment). 

C)	Develop projections of future MH/SA spending across a 10 year period.  Forecasting methods available should be assessed for usefulness and blended methods used, if this would provide the best projections.  As the total time period of past estimates lengthens, increasingly sophisticated methods should be possible.

D)	Prepare a variety of special reports integrating financing policy concerns of the current mental health and substance abuse treatment literature and trends, highlighting policy relevant findings.  These special reports will explore cost, service utilization, special populations or other trends to further refine the spending estimates and to explore the factors that affect the trends in spending.
Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due on February 9, 2006. The anticipated period of performance is a one year with four 1 year option periods. After review of the responses received a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities around February 28, 2006.  
Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 
1.	Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? 
2.	Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? 
3.	If disadvantaged, specify if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 
4.	Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 
5.	Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 
6.	Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 
7.	Is your business a large business? 
8.	Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity in use of the national databases that are currently used for the National Expenditures report of the Spending Estimates, specifically: National Health Accounts National Hospital Discharge Survey, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Nursing Home Survey, National Home and Hospice Care Survey, Market Scan, IMS Health Inc. data, Medicaid drug rebate data, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample, National Medical Expenditure Survey, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Economic Census, Health Care and Social Assistance Sector, Alcohol and Drug Services Study (ADSS), Inventory/Survey of Mental Healthcare Organizations (SMHO), National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (NSSATS) / Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)
9.	Describe in detail your proven capability, including staff expertise in performing such tasks, using advanced methods that are: 1) statistical; 2) econometric; 3) actuarial.  Specifically address methods used in prior work under the Spending Estimates project, including:  determining trim points and use of methods to impute missing information, such as hot deck imputations, especially if related to specialty MH/SA data bases such as ADSS, UFDS and SMHO; actuarial estimation and forecasting, such as smoothing, adjusting bias or addressing definitional problems; econometric techniques, including pricing adjustments; complex statistical techniques to determine data reliability, such as in multivariate analysis to correct standard error.  
10.	Describe your proven capability and experience with the CMS National Health Account and its construction, especially actuarial or econometric modeling and/or adjustments in methods for additional desegregation of data to address special populations, age groups, etc.
11.	Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to forecast expenditures and provide trend analysis, to identify emerging or changing data sets, link information from many different large data sets, other methods to enhance data usefulness, advanced statistical programming in extremely large claims data sets, such as incorporation of negative claims and familiarity in MH/SA coding, exclusions and under coding.
12.	Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to demonstrate a detailed understanding of MH/SA spending, and financing; knowledge of the MH/SA data elements in health and MH/SA data sets and data gaps, knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse (MHSA); success in peer reviewed publications and technical governmental reports; as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.205, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), Northwest is seeking to identify potential sources for an upcoming military construction (MILCON) project.  NAVFAC NW is seeking information regarding the qualifications and interest of firms for a MILCON project requiring a new consolidated fuel facility to be constructed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington.  This is a sources sought announcement and is designed to identify potential sources interested in this MILCON project.  This announcement is neither a solicitation notice nor a request for proposal.

PROJECT MAGNITUDE:  Approximately $22 Million.  

SITE:  The project is located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington.  The new facility site will be located in undeveloped property adjacent to a fuel tanker parking area.  The area will require pre-loading of the existing soils over approximately half the project site due to varying subsurface conditions.  

CONSTRUCTION:  This is a fully designed project consisting of the following major categories of work:

(1)  Fuel Storage Tank Construction.  This project includes the construction of a large consolidated fuel facility consisting of three (3) 30,000 barrel above-ground steel tanks with floating pans to store JP-8 jet fuel.  These field constructed tanks will be built to the American Petroleum Institute API - 650 standards.  Two (2) 40,000 gallon commercial aboveground steel tanks will be built for JP-5 fuel storage.  Dual fuel pump & filter house, four (4) lanes of loading/unloading stations for fuel trucks, secondary containment structures, cathodic protection, automatic tank gauging, storm drainage, site utilities, fire protection, emergency generators, access pavements, fencing, lighting and security systems will be required.  At another location, this project upgrades fuel booster pumps to increase fuel transfer rate on the existing cross island pipeline which will connect the new consolidated fuel facility with the existing fuel pier for barge delivery approximately 6 miles away.        

(2) Fuel Operations Building Construction.  This project includes the demolition of an existing fuels operations building and construction of a new facility of approximately 3,400 square feet (SF).  The new building will house the fuel manager?s office, dispatch office, driver ready room, fuel laboratory and a small shop for limited repair to fuel trucks.  The new building also consolidates all the instrumentation related to fuel truck dispatch, existing pipeline leak detection system, new tank gaging systems, and other instrumentation related to pipeline fuel transfer operations.

(3) Decommissioning of Existing Fuel Farms.  This project will close, in place, 16 existing field constructed underground fuel tanks ranging in age from 50 - 60 years old.  The tanks are located at four (4) separate fuel farms; two (2) near the Seaplane Base fuel pier; and two (2) at Ault Field Naval Air Station across the island.  The existing fuel storage facilities includes approximately 13 concrete tanks at 250,000 gallons each, two (2) steel tanks at 560,000 gallons, and one (1) steel tank at 154,000 gallons.  The tanks will be cleaned, tank closure samples taken, and reports prepared.  The tank shells will be closed in place by filling with soil.  The tank pump houses and all aboveground features will be demolished.  Underground piping within the tank farms and one of the two cross island pipelines will be flushed, capped and operationally closed.  

CHALLENGES:  NAS Whidbey Island is located outside the large metropolitan areas of Seattle and Everett Washington by approximately 60 to 90 miles.   Due to phased construction requirements (e.g., new facilities must be built, commissioned and the stored fuel transferred to the new facility before the decommissioning work can start), a lengthy construction period is anticipated.  Demolition of the existing Fuels Operations Building and other ancillary buildings may involve some asbestos and lead abatement work.

SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:  If your firm has interest and experience with this type of construction work, provide the following information:

(1) Provide evidence of your team?s capability and qualifications in performing similar construction projects for above ground, steel, field constructed fuel tanks and large scale fuel handling systems including pumping, filtering, dispensing, and leak detection.  Provide examples or narrative description of relevant projects that are of similar scope and size.   Include subcontractors, if applicable, and identify what work will be accomplished by your team.

(2) Indicate your team?s ability to obtain performance and payment bonds in the approximate amount of $22 million.  

(3)  Indicate your team?s business classification including SBA Certifications, if any.  

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION is October 6, 2006.  Information should be submitted in hard copy (a maximum of three copies) to Mona Carlson, Contract Specialist, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW), 1101 Tautog Circle Suite 313, Silverdale, WA  98315-1101.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information and Notice of Conference.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is seeking information from potential sources that can procure, assemble and integrate a network system based on a current design package for the Aviation Data Management And Control System (ADMACS).  The ADMACS is intended to be the Navy?s most advanced aviation network to be installed aboard aircraft Carriers.  The ADMACS is an integrated, network-centric Shipboard Aviation Operations information management system that provides naval aviation operations Planning, Execution, and Readiness/Assessment.  ADMACS is a tactical, real-time data management system that provides connectivity throughout the Air Department and other ship divisions and embarked staffs that manage Aircraft Launch & Recovery operations on CVN ships.  The ADMACS software is currently being developed by Navy engineers and will be completed prior to the first required installation.  The ADMACS network will provide a high-level network/backbone allowing NAVAIR?s Command & Control and information management systems to intercommunicate and provide a secure gateway for importing and exporting critical data among the ship's tactical, navigational, and meteorological command, control, communication, computer, sensors, and intelligence (C4SI) networks.  The network design is also in development by Navy engineers and will be completed prior to award of this first contract.  The ADMACS will provide a real time, fault tolerant (redundant), configuration managed, tactical Local Area Network (LAN) with an open system architecture as an electronic interface between shipboard tactical data systems, aircraft material readiness reporting systems, aviation ordnance accounting systems, shipboard critical systems, operating and monitoring systems and air operations planning / scheduling / tracking systems.  The ADMACS will be compatible with the Global Command and Control System ? Maritime (GCCS-M) architecture and, through the GCCS-M, it will be interoperable with other shipboard and other U.S. services? systems, data bases and networks which share like information or data fields.  It will incorporate a self-contained diagnostic and built-in-test (BIT) system, continuity or systems degradation alarms, redundant paths for continuous operations in a combat/damage control environment, and operator reconfiguration capability without impacting system operations.  The ADMACS is being developed to be compatible with the CVN-68 and CVN-21 class aircraft carriers.  The major design objectives for the ADMACS are: to reduce Total Ownership Costs (TOC), increase sortie rates, improve overall efficiency, improve weapon and fuel accountability, improve situational awareness and safety, provide for overall work reduction aboard ship and greatly improve aviation data management.  The hardware and network design package will be provided to interested parties upon request from the Contracting Officer.  The ADMACS program will reflect a system?level acquisition approach for an upgraded aviation data management system to replace the older technology and manual processes.  The Navy?s goal is to develop and procure an entire data management system (new racks, servers, switches, workstations, large screen displays, UPSs, and fiber optic cable).  The government intends to structure a program that is economically feasible while meeting the needs of the fleet.  This may result in the contractor(s) pricing out the core ADMACS basic system and any specific recommendations to the system and/or network as required.  The ADMACS basic system for an aircraft carrier is composed of four network switches populating 4 racks in addition to 1 NTP Server, 1 workstation, 1 application server and 1 database server per rack.  Also included in each rack is a UPS, a PDU, various media converters, cables and mounting assemblies.  

In FY 07, the ADMACS program will be entering the System Design and Development (SDD) phase of acquisition. The Navy anticipates that a single contract will be awarded for the SDD phase through full and open competition, to produce one (1) full size, fully integrated, production representative ADMACS Block 2 Engineering Development Model (EDM).  The goals of the SDD phase will be as follows:

1.	Procure system hardware based on provided engineering drawings (plus additional subsystems/components required to support environmental and shock qualification of the system as necessary).
2.	Build-up systems (based on drawings provided)
3.	Suggest modifications based on industry standards and current technology
4.	Modify/complete drawings if necessary
5.	Test jointly with NAVAIR LKE Team
6.	Deliver to EDM ship for technical and operational evaluation
7.	Participate in Integrated Testing in conjunction with Navy engineers. 

The EDM system will initially be assembled at the contractor?s facility for integration testing.  NAVAIR LKE engineers will install and test developed software on target hardware in conjunction with contractor?s engineers.  Following successful completion of an initial developmental lab testing, the system will be sent to the EMD named ship for operational evaluation.  Contractor engineers will work in conjunction with Navy engineers during Integrated Testing (IT) aboard ship.  It is anticipated that the SDD phase will continue into FY 09.  

The Navy is still evaluating its approach for the Production and Deployment (P&D) Phase of the program, to support CVN-68 class ship availabilities and possible CVN-21 class installations.  At this time, at least one LRIP unit is anticipated to be included in the SDD contract as an option quantity, but the Government is considering inclusion of all production units (eight additional installed systems and one lab system, to be delivered through FY 12) as option quantities.  If the Navy does not include the nine systems as options to the SDD contract, another full and open competitive procurement will be conducted for that quantity utilizing drawings produced during the SDD contract.    

At this time, the Navy is requesting interested potential offerors to notify the Contracting Officer with a statement of interest in the program and a discussion of its general capabilities and/or approach to fulfilling the Government?s requirements.  Note that information to be provided by the Government has been designated as "Militarily Critical Technical Data." Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may obtain a copy of the information. All requests for the ADMACS hardware and network design package must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800)-352-3572. The DLIS Unites States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal/.   Responses to this RFI (statement of interest and company capabilities) are requested no later than 25 September 2006.

<DESC>REPAIR SECTIONALIZING STATION D

        This project replaces an existing 15KV, 1200A metal clad outdoor switchgear station which consists of ten 1200A vacuum circuit breakers arranged in eight switchgear sections with a new 15 KV, 2000A metal clad outdoor switchgear station consisting of ten 1200A vacuum circuit breakers and two 2000A vacuum circuit breakers arranged in eight switchgear sections.  The new switchgear will be installed on the same footprint as the old switchgear. Existing feeder cables will be reconnected to the new switchgear except for two three phase cables which must be pulled back to an adjacent manhole and then rerouted to the new switchgear through existing conduits. A new two duct ductbank will be installed from an existing manhole to the switchgear for two new 15KV feeder circuits.  The new switchgear will include new SEL 351 digital relays for protection, metering and communications and a SEL 2032 communications processor which will connect to an existing Ethernet switch cabinet which is to be reinstalled on the new switchgear.  The existing switchgear has SEL351 relays.  The contractor will install relay settings and programming obtained from the existing relays and communication processor to the new relays and communications processor and test the new equipment to confirm its operation.  Testing is to include confirmation of proper communication between the new station and the existing base wide SCADA system.  The time period for the power outage to remove the existing switchgear and install the new and restore power is limited to 72 hours which will be scheduled for a holiday weekend.  This switchgear serves critical industrial loads and the outage time cannot be extended, therefore the contractor must have adequate resources to accomplish this task in the allotted time.  The contractor must possess a valid North Carolina Public Utility - Electrical, contractor's license and be insured to do such work in the state of North Carolina.

<DESC>Description

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is requesting information to determine the availability of interested parties to provide and operate an MRI and multimodality imaging facility for small rodent species in support for the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP).

The Offeror shall provide support to:
1.  Operate a Government-furnished 7 Tesla MRI system which consists of a 210 mm bore Magnex Scientific superconducting magnet with shielded gradients, a GE Medical Systems EXCITE console, and RF subsystems specific for imaging small laboratory rodent species. 

2. Maintain and extend the capability of this system as required by the NIEHS for extended capabilities such as increased spatial resolution, specific tissue contrast, and high specimen throughput.

3.  Perform MR imaging of rodent tissue specimens at a spatial resolution that is more than 300,000X greater than that routinely used on clinical imaging systems. The field of view for imaging may be directed at observations of the whole animal (e.g. mouse embryos or fetuses) and specific functional systems and /or organs (e.g. mouse brains, heart, lungs). This will entail; a.) The use of specialized tissue preparation methods for specimen fixation (use of alternate contrast agents, perfusion fixation), b.) Manufacture of specialized radiofrequency coils, and c.) Integration of unique image acquisition strategies and novel reconstruction methods to allow rapid acquisition (acquisition times of < 3 hrs) of very large high-quality image arrays (> 4 GB/image) with isotropic 3D spatial resolution < 25 microns. Tissue specimens shall be prepared in a manner that would permit subsequent evaluation of tissues by conventional histology following imaging.  Additional modalities for imaging small laboratory rodents such as micro-CT, ultra sound, molecular imaging and other specialized optical modalities may be required. The Contractor shall develop and operate such systems as appropriate for small animal (rodent) imaging in support of NIEHS studies.

4.  Perform longitudinal (in vivo) imaging studies in which the same animal(s) is/are imaged at multiple times to observe the time course and response (temporal pathogenesis and/or recovery) and pathology (development of anatomic features such as tumor growth) associated with exposure to xenobiotics.  Such studies shall require the use of specialized equipment and procedures for animal support structures and anesthesia to minimize motion, careful control of body temperature, and radiofrequency coils adapted to the very high magnetic field environment. 

5.  Provide and/or use a government furnished web-accessible digital electronic system for managing the access, review, downloading, and the archive of digital image data files and collateral documents pertaining to scientific imaging studies. The system must have the capacity to handle an exceptionally broad range of digitized imagery including conventional histology, very large 3D image arrays generated in MR histology, microCT, microPET, power point presentations, scanned images and other imagery, data, and collateral documentation. This scientific imaging management system must include the capability of enabling any user at NIEHS to access the images, data sets, and collateral documents from multiple sites with commonly used personal computers and modes of Internet access. 

6.  Provide expertise/advice concerning rodent magnetic resonance image acquisition strategy, MRI image quality, and its biological and/or scientific significance.  Participate in interpretation of the generated images and/or provide training in sample preparation and/or image interpretation for NIEHS investigators.

7.  The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following: 1) The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov; 2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association For Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA “Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies” (CFR 21 Part 85).

MANDATORY QUALIFICATIONS: The following mandatory qualification criteria must be met at the time of award:  1) the contractor shall provide an imaging facility, equipment except for magnet and APPROPRIATE staff dedicated exclusively to support of NIEHS/NTP studies; 2) the facility shall be located within a 30 to 45 minute driving time of the NIEHS main campus, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709; 3) the facility shall be accessible to NIEHS/NTP scientists; 4) all components of the Imaging Facility and the support areas including offices, and laboratories and a facility for temporary housing of small laboratory rodents in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (PL89-544) shall be located on one site.m

For estimating purposes the Government estimates the level-of effort at 15760 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional – 4920 direct labor hours; Technical - 9840 direct labor hours; Administrative Support - 1000 direct labor hours.

INTERESTED OFFERORS SHOULD SUBMIT (5) COPIES OF THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENT NOT TO EXCEED FIFTEEN (15) PAGES IN LENGTH, EXCLUDING STANDARD BROCHURES, ETC., FOR RECEIPT BY THE AGENCY ON June 27, 2006.  Please submit information to Patrick J. Barbour, Contract Specialist, NIEHS/OM/OA, P.O. Box 12874, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709. Courier address: Patrick J. Barbour, Contract Specialist, NIEHS/OM/OA, 79 TW Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Commons, Suite 100, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709 Inquiries will be accepted by fax (301) 451-5597 or e-mail barbourp@niehs.nih.gov

<SUBJECT>N--Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>Notice of Intent: The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pinnacle Learning LLC, to acquire training and facilitation services to include leadership training, team-building facilitation and customer service training.  This is a follow on purchase order for the Acquisition and Assistance Management Division (AAMD) customer service/customer focus initiative which began in June 2005. Training and facilitation services were previously competed among GSA Schedule holders.   The competitively selected consultants had begun implementation of new customer service strategies/processes.  More specifically, five customer service initiative teams have been formed using the guiding principles provided by the consultants to address customer service issues and provide customized solutions for AAMD customers. The training and facilitation services build on and augment the previous customer service/customer focus training provided by the consultants now employed by Pinnacle. The training program conducted by the contractor provided unique and innovative solutions to customer service issues and applied them to the conditions currently existing within AAMD. This was accomplished through staff interviews, development of teams and frequent interaction with the teams. Currently AAMD is in the third stage of the four stage process and attempting to implement another contractor's customer service strategy or bring another contractor up to speed on the existing methodology would be time consuming and cost prohibitive. It would undermine AAMD's customer service accomplishments, impact the AAMD's ability to accomplish its mission, and disenfranchise its customers. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to continue with the services of Pinnacle Learning through the defined final stages of the process.  Any firm that believes it can furnish the items described above is encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.   All responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail:  kgomez@do.usbr.gov.   Responses should include the firm's business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard: 500 employees for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This announcement serves as both a notice to offerors and as the solicitation.  Responses (Quotes) should be developed based upon this announcement since a formal solicitation (Request for Quotations) will not be issued.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAR Circular 2005-12.  The NAICS Code is 511210.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Wolfram Research, Inc., 100 Trade Center Drive, Champaign, IL 61820 for the renewal of a Mathematica? Annual Site License, with options for two additional annual renewals.  First released in 1988, Mathematica has evolved as a standard tool in many business, universities, and Government agencies in computer science and software development, being able to seamlessly integrate a numeric and symbolic computational engine, graphics system, programming language, documentation system, and advanced connectivity to other applications; which, in combination, offers a unique capability for addressing technical issues in biomedical science that cannot be obtained from any other brand name software application.  Approximately 40 NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs) have used Mathematica software for a number of years to support high-priority biomedical research projects that support their missions.  Wolfram is the sole manufacturer and supplier of Mathematica.  Unacceptable disruptions and costs to ongoing NIH research projects would result from any migration to another software platform.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a product that can perform the requirements described above.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Davis Dam Field Division, Bullhead City, AZ, has a requirement for repair of two guide bearings. Repair two guide bearings, one 40" X 15", four segment upper guide and one 48" X 18", four segment lower guide bearing, in conformance with the requirements defined in the attached drawings, and specified herein. The 48" X 18" bearing is out of round by approximately .015" ID. The quote shall include restoring the bearing to specified dimensions and rebabbitting if required. Bearing shell machining may be required. The 40" X 15" bearing has loose Babbitt and requires rebabbitting. All dimensions shall be verified to attached drawings.  The quote shall include the cost of all labor, materials, and equipment necessary to complete the job, including the following testing and certifications: 1. Certificate of Ultrasonic Testing.  2. Certificate of verification of the babbitt material and specifications used.  3. Copy of quality control inspection report.  4. Certificate of babbitt material analysis.  The quote shall include shipping to and from the location of refurbishment. Extra care must be taken during shipping and handling as not to damage the bearings in any way. The Davis Dam Field Division will provide shipping containers for the bearings. The estimated weight of the bearings and their packaging crates is:  lower guide - 850 lbs.  upper guide - 750 lbs. SCOPE OF TECHNICAL WORK  The old babbitt shall be removed from each bearing shell by machining and/or controlled heating procedures. The new babbitt is to be spin cast on the bearing shell. Stop-off shall be applied to areas not to be tinned to prevent tinning compound from sticking. The babbitt lining shall be anchored to the bearings by dovetailing and molecular bonding and confirmed by ultrasonic testing. Prior to final machining and/or any dimensional checks, the bearing split line bolts shall be torqued to a value of 200-250 ft-lbs. Final diameter readings taken at the mating ends of both shell halves shall not vary by more than .002". Final surface finish shall be 32 RMS or smoother for all bearing surfaces. All other dimensions are to be the same as shown on the drawing. Maintain grooves on the babbitted bearing surfaces as shown on the drawings. Drill and tap all holes in the babbitted areas for instrumentation as shown on the drawing. Special care shall be taken to ensure that the shell maintains final roundness dimensions as specified on the drawings.  Materials and Workmanship:  The babbitt metal material shall conform to ASTM Designation B-23, Grade 2 for all guide bearings. Workmanship shall conform to the requirements noted on the drawing. TESTING REQUIREMENTS  All bearings shall be examined by Ultrasonic (UT) and Liquid Penetrant (PT) testing methods in accordance with Spec. 01-11, section 05090, and as specified herein.  Perimeter and Holes:  Zone defined as bond surface area within 1" from any edge or hole having an exposed bond line. The maximum dimension of any individual unbonded area shall be less than ½", with acceptable unbonded areas located no closer than 2" apart. The total unbonded area shall be no larger than 5% of the total zonal area.  Corners:  Zone defined as bond surface area within 1" from any corner having an exposed bond line. Corners shall have no unbonded areas.  Dovetails:  Zone defined as entire surface area over a dovetail. Dovetails are exempt from UT examination.  Bond Lines:  Defined as exposed lines at the babbitt to base metal interface. PT indications of lack of bond totaling over 10% of the length of a particular edge shall be unacceptable. Unbonded areas extending more than 1/8" away from an edge shall be unacceptable.  Remainder of Shell or Pad:  Zone defined as bond surface area other than perimeters, holes, corners and dovetails. The maximum area for any individual unbonded area shall be less than one square inch or 3% of the total zonal area, whichever is less. Acceptable unbonded areas shall be located no closer than 2" apart. The total unbonded area shall be no larger than 5% of the total zonal area.  BABBITT REMOVAL AND CLEANING The contractor shall remove all old babbitt from each section of the bearing shell by means of machining and/or controlled heating procedures, cleaning the bearing shell thoroughly for tinning and application of new babbitt. Care shall be taken to minimize thermal distortion of the bearing shell. TINNING After thorough removal of the old babbitt, the entire bonding surface for the babbitt must be re-tinned. Cast iron bearing shell must be tinned with nickel. Stop-off shall be applied to areas not to be tinned to prevent tinning compound from sticking. REBABBITTING The new babbitt is to be centrifugally cast on the bearing shell and shall be done as one continuous pour. The contractor shall temporarily plug oil passageways and temperature wells which are subject to babbitt infiltration prior to casting. Bearing shall be centrifugally cast in a continuous pour.   MACHINING Machining shall be completed in two phases. Following re-babbitt, the bearing bore shall be machined to uniform diameter suitable for ultrasonic inspection. After the inspection confirms that the babbitt bond meets the requirements stipulated in this specification, split-line bolts shall be installed and properly torqued to drawing specifications and the bearing shall be machined to final dimensions shown on the drawing and subject to the following: Bore finish of babbitt shall be 32 rms or better. Machining of oil grooving and thermometer bulb holes is required as detailed on the drawing. Fractional tolerances are ± 1/64 inch. The bore shall be perpendicular to the radial mounting flange within 0.002 inch over the entire length. The bore shall be concentric to the shells outer load bearing lands within 0.002 inch. INSPECTIONS a.	After machining to a uniform bore diameter, the contractor shall inspect the entire surface of the bearing for bonding to the cast iron shell using pulsed reflection ultrasonic inspection techniques in accordance with ASTM E114 (2001) - Standard Practice for Ultrasonic Pulse-Echo Straight-Beam Examination by the Contact Method, and ASTM E165 (2002) - Liquid Penetrant Inspection Method. The inspector must be certified as ASNT-TC-1A, Level II, Rev 96 (2000).  The total area of un-bonded babbitt is not permitted to exceed ten (10) percent of the total babbitted surface, and no single un-bonded area is permitted to exceed a dimension of one (1) square inch. Lack of bond at any exposed bond line(s) is unacceptable.  Less bond than specified above shall require rebabbitting. The babbitt shall show no evidence of porosity by visual or ultrasonic inspection. A detailed, scaled drawing showing mapped bonding test results shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph  b.	After machining the bearing to final dimensions, a dimensional inspection shall be conducted to verify that tolerances were held. Final dimensional readings should be taken at 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°, top, bottom and middle of the bearing. Final machining results shall be recorded and signed by a certified journeyman machinist or quality inspector and submitted per paragraph 1.3 (Submittal Requirements) and Table 1A (List of Submittals).

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Sidewinder Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML firewalls currently have the Sidewinder appliances installed as one of the major components of the Department of State email and Internet infrastructure in order to maintain a high level of security and stability.  The above listed maintenance is set to expire 30 September 2006.  The maintenance is required to be renewed on yearly bases in order for EML to continue to receive 24x7 phone support, email, web-based access, free software patches, and major upgrades to these systems.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s firewall networking infrastructure. Based on the above requirements, the Sidewinder Maintenance is required for the continued protection of the external perimeter of the Department of State Internet presence.  Because of the sensitive nature of the mission critical operating environment, any deviations to the Maintenance would render the firewall infrastructure vulnerable to potential viruses, harmful attacks and interrupt the availability of the network to State employees.  The goal of the Department is to maintain a cohesive firewall infrastructure with maximum protection and utilization.

A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via HP authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales. D) Full HP warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s BIMC (Phase II) projects needs. The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: • Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management • Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health • Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks • Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives • Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers • Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) • CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting • 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives • Systems must have front video/USB ports • Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources • Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The servers required for the BIMC Phase II project must have RAID configuration utility compatible with existing systems so that no new user training is required. The HP DL380 G5 servers meet this stipulation.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA)
DEFENSE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION - EUROPE

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
TO PROCURE CISCO EQUIPMENT USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION



Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C.501), FAR Subpart 8.405-6.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity

The requiring activity for this action is USAFE CSS/SCML, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action

Requirement is for the purchase of Cisco Synchronous Network Equipment (SONET) is for the upgrade of the USAFE, Technical Control Facilities (TCF) under the HQ USAFE TCF Modernization Program.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services

The requirement is for 51 CISCO Timing Communications Control Two Plus I-Temp, Part number: 15454-TCC2P-K9.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority

(40 U.S.C. 501), Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, FAR Subpart 8.405-6.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.
This is a part of on-going 51 million dollar MAJCOM-wide Modernization Program and the continued integration and implementation of a Technical Control Facility (TCF) Modernization Program.  The first installation was started in FY04 at Aviano, Italy and will continue through 2008. This product is also a standard device for the base infrastructure backbone currently being installed by the Combat Information Transport System (CITS) Project Air Force wide.  Currently there are 31 of these devices installed at five bases. This product is an upgrade to the existing controller cards already installed across the theater. As such, award of another brand would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  These costs include re-engineering, re-certification, and retraining of Government personnel on newly acquired non-standard equipment.  Therefore, the purchase of other brand equipment would add unforeseen costs to the overall TCF Upgrade Program.  The CISCO SONET product line has a proprietary integrated management capability that ensures consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  Furthermore USAFE/A6 is deploying an enterprise remote monitoring and management solution command-wide, which further justifies the CISCO solution as it allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center to use a single tool to manage all USAFE SONET equipment.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

IAW FAR Part 5.202(a)(11), no announcement will be made to FEDBIZOPPS due to the fact that the award will be made to a pre-awarded GSA Schedule.  Numerous sources exist that provide CISCO equipment and significant sources will be solicited for quotes via GSA schedule. At least three GSA/federal schedule holders will be solicited for quotes.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price

The requirement will be competed with resellers of the equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

While brand name CISCO equipment may be restrictive, market research indicates there are several resellers of CISCO equipment.  

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included the evaluation of several technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi, Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timplex to name a few.  The evaluation consisted of personal experiences of USAFE personnel, review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations; an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the CISCO SONET product line as the optical layer multiplexer.

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater.

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

Any reseller or wholesaler of these products with competitive prices will express interest.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

USAFE must remain with the CISCO product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment; and market research indicates that there are enough resellers of this product line to promote competition.

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order.

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.

14.  Section 508 Compliance

Required Section 508 documentation has been provided.

15. This equipment has been JITC (Joint Interoperability Test Command) certified.

1.7	Navy Approach to Service Contracting	The Department of Navy (DoN) spends over $1 billion in annual obligations to meet global requirements for facility operations and maintenance provided through Facility Support Contracts (FSC) and additional billions to provide other base operations support services (OBOS).  The Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) has focused increased attention on re-engineering FSC contracts in response to customer and industry feedback, budget constraints, and the impact of a variety of contracting, program management and financial management regulations.  The Navy also supports the following principles:
1.7.1	Partnering Philosophy	The first principle is that the Navy views its contractors as partners and not just abstract service providers.  The Navy wants its contractors to succeed because partners' success drives the Navy's successful mission completion.  Within the bounds of acquisition policy the Navy intends to work to find solutions that will be beneficial to both the Government and its partners.
1.7.2	Contractor's Knowledge	The second principle is that the Navy will receive insightful management from its contractors.  This management will include the knowledge, skills, authority and willingness to use contractor resources to find better ways of serving Navy clients? strategic and operational goals and objectives.  The Navy's use of performance-based objectives evidences this principle.  Although performance work statements will typically contain several levels of performance assessment, the Navy wants its contractors to exercise maximum discretion within bounds of prudent risk management to adjust processes and resources needed to reach specified objectives at the highest performance level.
1.7.3	Industry Best Practices	The third principle is that the Navy will adopt industry best commercial practices and maintain state-of-the-art service delivery.  It is the Navy's and contractor's responsibility as partners to reach this goal.  To that end, the Navy's emphasis will be in evaluating performance objectives (end results).
1.8	Standard Template	Key to implementing a programmatic approach is using a standard template that ensures Navy-wide consistency yet affords appropriate tailoring to meet local needs.  This contract conforms to the standard template and has been tailored for this solicitation.  NAVFAC intends to use this template-based approach for future service contracts.  Offerors should develop an understanding of the template as part of performing due diligence in reaching an understanding of the Navy?s requirements and expectations.

The standard template contains 18 standard annexes.  Annex 1 will always contain information that is relevant to the entire scope of the contract.  Annex 2 contains on-site project management and administration requirements that are relevant to the entire scope of the contract.    Annexes 3 through 18 contain the technical information and requirements peculiar to that technical annex.  Within each technical annex, the organization of information and requirements are also standardized.  Specification item 1 will always contain General Information.  Specification item 2 will always contain the management and administrative requirements.  Specification item 3 will always contain the Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) requirements.  Specification item 4 will always contain the Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) requirements. All costs associated with Annexes 1 and 2 and Specification items 1 and 2 must be priced and distributed within Specification Item 3 of Annexes 3 through 18.
1.9	Navy PBSC Approach	The Navy?s approach to performance-based service contracting (PBSC) includes four component parts which are 1) performance outcomes, 2) measurable standards, 3) consideration of incentives, and 4) performance assessment plan. 

1.10	Technical Proposal Certification	The contractor warrants that its proposal incorporated herein by reference including, but not limited to, proposed approaches, staffing, methodology, or work plans, will meet the performance objectives set forth in this contract during execution thereof.  The contractor is not excused from meeting such performance objectives in the event such proposal proves inadequate as conceived or executed to meet such performance objectives.  The contractor understands that it bears all of the cost and performance risk associated with adopting acceptable additional (and/or alternative) means or methods of meeting the performance objective.

A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is to conduct Macrobenthic and Habitat Nekton community analyses of sediment samples from the National Coastal Assessment Program and the Altered Habitat Project from date of award through September 30, 2010.  The contractor shall conduct macrobenthic and valued Northern Gulf of Mexico fish/shellfish community analyses on 50 to 400 sediment or near bottom subtidal nekton (larval and juvenile) samples collected during August 2006 through September 2010 from the National Coastal Assessment Program and the Altered Habitat project.  The minimum number of samples will be 50. Additional quantities above the minimum will be ordered at the discretion of the Government. These analyses require the measurement of species composition and abundance of macroinvertebrate fauna found in the sediments. Benthic samples shall be sieved in the field through 0.5 mm sieves, placed in  pre-labeled jars, and preserved in a formalin Rose Bengal-stained buffered solution.  Basic sample processing steps include sieving, sorting, and species identification and enumeration.  Each sample site includes one to three replicate samples. Northern Gulf of Mexico shallow habitat nekton samples (fish and shellfish, e.g. penaeid shrimp ssp., sciaenid fish ssp., blue crab) shall be measured, weighed (wet wt.), and sorted for abundance and diversity analyses and growth and survival analyses. The sorted samples shall be retained in labeled (inside and out) polyethylene or polypropylene bottles and preserved in ethanol or buffered formalin and rose bengal. Species identification will be done to the lowest practical taxon using keys specific for the Northern Gulf. Procedures for sorting, counting, and identifying the  estuarine benthic macroinvertebrates shall follow EMAP-E procedures (Frithsen et al., 1994). Estuarine benthic macroinvertebrates shall be identified to the lowest level practical taxonomic level.

PROVISIONS & CLAUSES: 
The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition.  The FAR provision 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror?s Commercial Items; and 52.212.-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

The provision at 52.212.2 applies to the acquisition and is provided in full test.  FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION? COMMERICAL ITEMS (JAN 1999):  (a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (1) TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES = 50 POINTS AVAILABLE: The technical capabilities evaluation factor will assess the depth and breadth of the offeror?s experience in providing quality assurance, performance improvement, risk management, quality of care surveys for dental programs and hospital and health center accreditation consultation services to assist various service unit hospitals and health centers in meeting medical care evaluation/performance improvement program standards.  The technical proposal shall indicate how the consultation services are compliant with rules, regulations, and policies prescribed by regulatory agencies and bodies such as the JCAHO, Department of Health and Human Services, I.H.S. Headquarters, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  In assessing the offeror?s technical capabilities, the proposal will be judged solely on the written material provided by the offeror.

To assist in the evaluation of the technical capabilities criteria, the offeror shall provide a staffing plan to assure the availability of qualified and experience staff capable of meeting statement of work requirements during the contract performance period.  The offeror shall document that they have the necessary technical capacity to complete staffing requirements in a timely, comprehensive, and successful manner.  (2) PAST PERFORMANCE AND EXPERIENCE = 50 POINTS AVAILABLE:  The Past Performance and Experience evaluation factor will assess the relevance and breadth of the offeror?s experience and the quality of the offeror?s past performance on contract work consistent in scope and complexity with the 2007 Performance Improvement Services project.  Past Performance and experience will be assessed on task orders or contracts completed during the past three years and all task orders currently in progress which are consistent in scope and complexity with the 2007 Performance Improvement Services project.  The offeror?s technical proposal shall include a listing of previous or existing task orders, purchase orders, or contracts awarded to the offeror in other rural or Indian Health Service facilities.  Orders must similar in scope and complexity as the requirements outlined in the statement of work.  The offeror must include the following information for each task order, purchase order, or contract:

1.	Name of task ordering activity and ordering officer
2.	Order number
3.	Order type
4.	Total order value
5.	Description of work
6.	If appropriate, list of the Indian Health Service project officer and telephone number

The offeror must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past rural or IHS contract assignments.  Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior task orders, purchase orders, and contracts for similar services.  The offeror shall include the following past performance information:

1.	Identify the one order that you consider to be the most successful and the reasons for this determination.
2.	Evidence of timely and acceptable performance on projects of similar size and complexity.
3.	Evidence indicating customer satisfaction for similar services outlined in the statement of work.
4.	Evidence of concern for cost control and budgetary considerations.

The IHS will make a separate determination of price reasonableness.  An unrealistic price proposal may be the evidence of the offeror?s lack of understanding or poor understanding of the project.  The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion shall be which offeror can perform the task order in a manner most advantageous to the Aberdeen Area as determined by the evaluation of proposals according to established evaluation criteria.  Under best value principles, there are no requirements that a task order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost.  The award of a task order primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns.

Estimated costs must be reasonable for the tasks to be performed and if consideration is narrowed to choosing among proposals with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. 


The offeror must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past contracts and/or jobs, Government and/or commercial.  Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts/jobs. The offeror must list at least three contract/jobs and include the following information. (1) Name of Government agency/company; (2) Contract number, if applicable; (3) Dates of service/employment; (4) Total contract value/hourly wage; (5) Description of contract work/job duties; (6) Contracting Officer/Company Manager and telephone number; (7) Program Manager and telephone number, if applicable.  Technical and past performance when combined, are considered approximately equal to cost or price.  (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

OTHER CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS  

CONTRACT SECURITY INVESTIGATIVE REQUIREMENT: The employees of the contractor entering the institution shall meet certain security requirements to receive an institutional pass as required by Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 3000.02 dated March 10, 1994.  Primary concerns are the amount of contact that may occur between the Contractor and his/her employees with the inmate population during the performance of the contract.  
The program manager at the FCC Beaumont is responsible for conducting the appropriate vouchering, law enforcement checks, and ensuring that fingerprinting is completed on all Contractor staff that may need access inside the confines of the secure perimeter.  The personnel department will establish a security file that will be maintained on each of the contractor's employees from the beginning of the contract through its duration.  The following investigative procedures will be performed:

National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check;
DOJ-99 (name check);
FD-258 (fingerprint check):
Law Enforcement Agency checks;
Vouchering of Employers;
Resume/Personal Qualifications;
Completed Contractor Pre-employment Form;
OPM-329-A (Authority for Release of Information);
National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) check (if applicable); and
Urinalysis Test (for the detection of marijuana and other drug usage).

By submitting a quotation, the contractor and its employees agree to complete the required documents and undergo the listed procedures.  An individual employee of the contractor who does not pass the security clearances will be unable to perform services under the contract.  If the resulting contract is to be awarded to an individual, all clearance procedures shall be applied prior to award.  Individuals who do not pass the security clearance will not be awarded a contract. The final determination and completion of the security investigation procedures will be made at the sole discretion of the FCC Beaumont.  

All persons are advised that a urinalysis test for the detection of marijuana and other drug usage shall be performed.  Any person(s) testing positive shall be disqualified from performing under the resulting contract.  Any individual employed by the Contractor deemed not suitable by the BOP requirements will not be granted access to perform services under the contract.  This is a condition of the contract.  The Contractor must be in compliance with Department of Justice regulations at 8 CFR 274a regarding the employment of aliens.  A copy of this directive is available upon the Contractor's request. Contractor employees shall adhere to all institution regulations regarding conduct and performance.  Contractor employees will be allowed access to the FCC Beaumont at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Any individual  performing under this contract may be removed if it becomes apparent that his/her conduct does not reflect the conduct of that prescribed for those people performing under this contract. 

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	œ	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	œ	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	œ	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required; 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.    

b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

Both gates are open Monday through Friday,  excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.

Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.   The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notif y the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance)  will require a time stamped searched- label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with th e procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie  or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either  a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor  employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identif ication badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification  badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for be ing issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, th e contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identifi cation badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contr actor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.

If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the f ast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.- Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  -In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subpar agraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.-  Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representat ions and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.

On w eekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issue d at the Main Gate, as appropriate.

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G4 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL380 G4 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal configuration to meet the projects needs.  The above-mentioned equipment will be used to upgrade the Class Net server farm where HP ProLiant servers are already in use.  If the hardware changes, i.e., another manufacturer’s product is brought in, the ability to restore and back up the servers will be compromised since the same hardware is required for back ups and restore.  Since HP has proprietary BIOS and firmware, to get rid of the existing hardware would disrupt the ability to re-deploy servers in the event of a failure. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G4 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 and DL 360 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: · Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management · Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health · Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks · Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives · Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers · Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) · CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting · 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives · Systems must have front video/USB ports · Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources · Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.

Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order. Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: · Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management · Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health · Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks · Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives · Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers · Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) · CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting · 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives · Systems must have front video/USB ports · Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources · Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY.  NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. DELETED DUPLICATE LINE ITEMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN SERVER CONFIGURATION.  ALSO, INCLUDED SERVER CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENT.

Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order. Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: · Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management · Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health · Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks · Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives · Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers · Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) · CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting · 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives · Systems must have front video/USB ports · Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources · Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS GFMS will work in concert with the recently implemented Regional Financial Management System (RFMS) that uses the same COTS software and technical architecture. The same technical architecture is also used for the Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) project with USAID. GFMS requires an expansion to the existing Storage Area Network (SAN) development environment in BIMC and Charleston, SC to accommodate the increased volume of domestic financial data. The CFMS development environment is estimated to be 12 terabytes. This estimate includes the space required for primary storage for several development and test environments (e.g. development, integration, production simulation, etc.) as well as sufficient mirror backup copies.   Data must be fully mirrored to an existing Network Appliance secondary SAN to replicate the current 23x6 ½ worldwide operation. Charleston currently supports 178 posts and Washington at the consolidated facility. Data must be continuously "mirrored" to secondary databases to support the high availability required by 23 hour per day operations, as well as reporting, backup and recovery without affecting online production. Likewise, the SAN must support high volumes of data updates from both batch and online sources and be able to "simulate" all key production storage operations. In order to debug performance issues, test new releases of operating system software, and ensure consistent operations support to production, the development SAN environment must be the same as the production SAN.  In addition, GFMS requires a second SAN for its corresponding COOP installation at the Beltsville, MD (BIMC) COOP site. BIMC already uses Network Appliance technology to support the COOP operations of a number of Bureaus including RM, AF, DS and WHA. This COOP SAN will be used to support the implementation of GFMS. Industry Data Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in Network Appliance SAN hardware and software technology. Network Appliance SAN hardware is used by State and USAID for the current production operations of the RFMS and Phoenix financial systems as well as the RFMS COOP site. The State Department has taken extensive advantage of the Network Appliance SAN software technology in the bureaus to support Network Appliance mirroring of bureau data to consolidated databases. Network Appliance SAN hardware/software technology is currently installed in IRM, DS, EUR, WHA, AF and RM and has been approved by the ITCCB (Ref # H-AS-NA-AS-0024). Network Appliance technology has also been adopted by the State Department's preferred database vendor (Oracle) as its own internal corporate SAN in one of the largest (several hundred terabytes) corporate SAN installations supporting Oracle's worldwide operations. The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The Department's financial system must be available worldwide on a 23 x 6 ½ basis at the consolidated facility in Charleston, SC. (CONTINUED)  The Department has already deployed Network Appliance hardware for the production versions of RFMS that supports all overseas financial activity. GFMS will use the same technical architecture as RFMS and ultimately will be combined into a single database. The development environment that GFMS is built and tested in must be 100% compatible with production RFMS. This means the same release of software, the same ability to "mirror" databases, and the ability to test new releases of the Network Appliance operating system software before they are moved onto the production Network Appliance SAN.The Department is also in the midst of an important effort with USAID in the implementation of a Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) that consolidates both State and USAID on a common technical platform to be hosted by the State Department in the Financial Services Center in Charleston, SC. Again OMB is closely monitoring the progress of this initiative. USAID has already installed Network Appliance SAN hardware/software for their Phoenix financial system. The selection of different SAN by State would mean that State and USAID could not share common components within the JFMS Charleston technical environment, thus eliminating planned savings on software and hardware.   Recommendation Based on the current production installed base of Network Appliance SAN hardware/software and the critical need for the GFMS and JFMS projects to stay consistent with their production storage operations, RM recommends this one time acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of Network Appliance SAN hardware and software for the GFMS development environment and the GFMS COOP site.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of State’s enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.

(viii) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. The contractor shall provide delivery of all equipment no later than November 30, 2006. (ix) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concern and apprehension of the introduction of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza into the United States, the NAHLN has been directed by the USDA to double the current diagnostic testing capacity for the real time RT-PCR (real time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (x) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
?	Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the AmbionR MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor.
?	Must be able to process AmbionR MagMAtm paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit
?	Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
?	Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
?	Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
?	Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
?	Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
?	Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
?	Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
?	Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
?	Must have a 1year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.  The contractor must include in their services, travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment and train the staff on the use of the equipment. 
?	The magnetic particle processor must be able to manipulate multiple 96 well plates filled with different reagent solutions so that the paramagnetic beads (with viral RNA bound to them) can be lifted from one reagent plate to another.  There can be no mixing of materials (reagents or beads) from one well to another on the same plate.  This is typically accomplished with a magnetic particle processor head that contains 96 magnetic rods.   Therefore a separate magnetic rod will contact each separate well on the 96 well plate.
In addition to the technical specifications described above, the magnetic particle processor must be able to perform the following protocols are listed here: (a) insert a protective covering over each of the magnetic rods i.e. plastic tip cover; (b) allow for the 96 well initial sample plate to be loaded into the equipment; (c) allow a 4 minute incubation and gentle mixing cycle for the initial sample plate with lysis buffer, magnetic beads, and diagnostic samples to allow viral RNA binding ? total well volume of 171ul; (d) collect the beads from each well from the initial viral RNA binding step and allow 2 minutes for capture;  (d) transfer and release the beads into to a plate with the wash solution I and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (e) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution I step and allow 1 minute for capture;    (f) transfer and release the beads into a plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (g) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (h) transfer and release the beads into a second plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (i) collect the beads from each well from the second wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (j) allow the beads to dry for 2-5 minutes by shaking in open air; (k) transfer and release the beads into a final plate with the elution buffer solution and allow to incubate with gentle mixing for 4 minutes ? total well volume of 50ul; (l) collect the beads from each well from the final elution step and allow 2 minutes for capture; (m) discard the beads and protective magnetic rod coverings into a separate container.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received from potential offerors.

1.  Q. Will a dual-fluid water mist system be acceptable for the testing regime?  
 A. The Ship's air is low pressure and should be able to handle the requirement.

2.  Q. A previous answer stated that the Shadwell has several high pressure pumps and systems, is there an air compressor available and, if so, what are its capacities?
A.   The ship's air should be of the capacity needed, but the piping may not supply the needed and the pipe would have to be run for the special test.   The compressor for the ships air is rated at 40 CFM.

The main functions of the panels will be to orient visitors to the flora and fauna of the Back River as viewed from the nature walk, Chesapeake Bay, and Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts.  Each panel will come with one backup copy so the base will receive a total of at least twenty-two (22) panels.  These specifications and plans are intended to describe the general performance of the completed work and do not attempt to show in complete detail the exact construction and finished appearance of the work. It is the contractor's responsibility to provide completed work of first class quality that maintains the aesthetic and performance intent established by these documents.  The desired process should follow the National Park Service UniGuide Sign System.

V.	Guidelines for Interpretive Panel and Support Design and Installation 

Contractor will conduct necessary research for text development, illustration or graphics development, and photo selection. Accuracy of information is of the highest importance. Drawings (illustrations) should accurately depict habitats, landforms, and wildlife. Biological accuracy is most important; however, aesthetics and appeal are also extremely important. 

Contractor will conduct necessary research for panel installation. Contractor will convey to the Air Force the method for installing the interpretive panels at each site. In designing the interpretive panel mounting systems, both matching the kiosk design and making them climate resistant are important.  

Contractor will warranty the interpretive panels for 10 years against fading and delamination.
