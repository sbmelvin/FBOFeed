<DESC><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking qualification statements from Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for various A-E services in the states covered by EPA Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The states in the covered area are MA, RI, NY, NJ, PA, VA, MD, NC, GA, FL, MS, and AL. EPA intends to award one or more indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts under this acquisition, with a target effective date of March 1, 2011. Each contract is expected to have a five-year performance period, with a minimum order amount of $25,000. The estimated value of this acquisition is $5 million, inclusive of all contracts. Task orders are expected to typically range between $25,000 and $250,000, although some will likely be higher or lower. Loaded hourly rates (inclusive of overhead and profit) for each major discipline will be negotiated for each contract year. These loaded rates will serve as the basis for pricing task orders. Task orders under each contract are expected to include the preparation of designs, plans, specifications, cost estimates, studies and reports, surveys, and construction phase services. Projects may involve alterations, renovations and additions to research facilities and office buildings, including site and infrastructure. The work will primarily involve government-owned property, but leased property may be included. Work will be submitted in hard copy report format, hard copy D-size drawings, and/or CADD and other electronic formats.
