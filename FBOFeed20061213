<ARCHDATE>12132007
<CONTACT>VERITA FRIESNER CONTRACTING SPECIALIST 9162789328     vfriesner@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Coastal & Marine Geology, Menlo Park, CA intends to make a sole source award to David Reid, 1411 Dwight Way, Berkeley, CA 94702 to provide georeferencing of historical maps in OR,WA, and AK, perform shoreline change analysis, and write reports.  This work is another phase of the work the Contractor completed in 2006 for the California shoreline.  A primary goal of this work is to develop standardized methods for mapping and analyzing shoreline movement so that internally consistent updates can periodically be made to record shoreline erosion and accretion.  This project involves close cooperation between the three main USGS coastal centers: Santa Cruz, California, St. Petersburg, Florida, and Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  The proposed procurement requires the ability to integrate widely varied datasets into a quantitative assessment of shoreline positions and the experience to incorporate datum offsets where appropriate.  The Contractor is to provide expertise with regard to data acquisition, processing, and analysis for creation of maps and GIS products in a manner consistent to those being employed for other regions of the coastal U.S. as part of the National Assessment for Coastal Change Hazards Project.  The job requires a unique combination of skills, professional relationships, and ability to develop new methodologies and data manipulation expertise.  The Contractor's unique abilities are as follows: 1) The Contractor has the essential expertise in selecting alternative data sets that still meet the required accuracies when desired data layers are not available for all areas and time ranges.  2) The desired contractor has developed critical qualities that include an eye for detail, while working the CA coastline, and of careful analysis that has led to the development of a process that delivers accurate and consistent results.  3) In consultation with USGS scientists, the contractor has developed a number of analysis tools that allow the incorporation of local wave height, tide range, and beach slope to create a set of unique offset corrections that can be applied to short coastal segments.  This correction greatly improves the overall accuracy of the analysis and, at present, is only performed by the selected contractor.  4) The contractor has worked closely with the USGS developers of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and routinely offers improved methodologies and analysis tools.  5) The contractor has been instrumental in designing data outputs that meet the critical elements of publication.  The combination of skills, knowledge, and expertise possessed by the sole source satisfies the agency requirements in the fullest, most consistent and complete manner and avoids duplication of effort that obtaining these services from another source would cause.  Government's required period of performance: date of award for 1 year with 2 Option Years.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a solicitation.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond by the response date of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9339 or email vfriesner@usgs.gov.  A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  See Note 22 and Note 26.

<CONTACT>PAMELA DAVIS, (202) 385-8571
<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The Federal Aviation Administration has a requirement for approximately 200 Sony Model DDMA-FH1C 110V power supplies.  These power supplies are manufactured by the Sony Corporation for use in the Sony DDM-2800-C Main Display Monitor (MDM).  The Sony DDM-2800-C MDM is the radar display used for the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), as well as the Arts Color Display (ACD) System.  The Sony Model DDMA-FH1C 110V power supply is no longer manufactured, and is unprocurable.  Should the FAA be unable to obtain the 110V power supplies, a costly and lengthy acquisition of a new radar display will be required, or, facilities that are currently wired for 110V power will need to be rewired to accept 220V power. The FAA does have an ample supply of Sony Model DDMA-FH2C, 220V power supplies.  These Sony Model DDMA-FH2C 220V power supplies can be modified to become the Sony Model DDMA-FH1C 110V power supplies.  This modification is only known to be available from the Sony Corporation because they hold the proprietary data rights, modification specifications, and testing capabilities for these items.  The Government does not have the technical documentation available to allow other sources to repair these items.  An internal determination was made that the modification of the 220V power supply to 110V is the most cost effective and timely approach to meeting this requirement. Should you believe you can perform the work described above, and wish to receive consideration as a potential modification source, you must provide in writing a complete set of system specification drawings, all required standards and testing specifications, test plans, part lists, and proof of rights to use the data.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.   All interested parties are advised the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. Parties that can meet this requirement should reply via email, by close of business December 22, 2005, to the Contracting Officer, Pamela Davis at pamela.davis@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Government intends to acquire commercially available product using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.  NOAA?s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) is a partner in implementing the U.S. portion of the Argo program.  Basic instruments:  (1) Provide profiling floats that are deployment-ready (calibrated, assembled, ballasted, weighed and tested), equipped with CTDs as specified below, and posses Service Argos telemetry/position fix capability. Optional Items:  (1) Provide float air deployment packages, 
(2) Provide float VOS deployment packages, and (3) Provide floats that are deployment-ready (calibrated, assembled, ballasted, weighed and tested), with CTDs as specified below except capable of sampling temperature, salinity, and pressure continuously throughout their ascent, then reducing those data by bin averaging.  Also these floats should determine position by GPS before transmitting those data to shore via Iridium. 
Basic Instrument Specifications/Requirements:  (1) Floats must be capable of a minimum gross fractional volume change of 1% to allow cycling between the surface and 2000-dbar pressure over nearly all of the global (ice-free) ocean, (2) Floats must be able to park for predetermined 5-15 day periods at a different predetermined subsurface pressure than their profiling pressure ("park and profile" capability), (3) Floats must be capable of sampling temperature, salinity, and pressure at a minimum of 70 predetermined pressures during their ascent, then transmitting those data to shore and determining float position via Service Argos (or Iridium/GPS), (4) Floats must have sufficient energy in their standard configuration to perform the above functions for a period of 4 years with a duty cycle of 10 days, (5) Floats must have demonstrated performance, with examples of deployed instruments successfully performing the above functions for 4 years with a 10-day duty cycle, (6) Floats must be light enough (<35 kg) to ensure that deployments from a variety of platforms including volunteer observing ships (VOS) are feasible, (7) Floats must be delivered to PMEL (the contractor shall pay for the delivery) in boxes sufficiently sturdy to protect the floats prior to deployment, while in transit, and onboard ship or aircraft, (8) Float boxes must be built to accommodate stacked loading and moveable with a forklift or pallet jack, and be suitable for export to most countries (e.g. all wood components of appropriately treated plywood), (9) Float CTDs must have average initial measurement accuracies of +/-0.002 C in temperature, +/-0.005 PSS-78 in salinity, and +/-3 dbar in pressure, (10) Float CTDs must have demonstrated reliability and stability of  +/-0.01 C in temperature,  +/-0.02 PSS-78 in salinity, and  +/-6 dbar in pressure over multi-year missions,  11) Float CTDs must use a system that ensures temperature and conductivity measurements are made within the same controlled volume of water, 12) Float CTDs must employ conductivity cells with antifouling protection by diffusion of TBTO in a controlled volume (no cell coatings), (13) Floats (and accompanying instrumentation, including CTDs) must pass PMEL tests for performance to the satisfaction of PMEL personnel, or be replaced/repaired by the contractor at the contractor's expense (including shipping costs in both directions) and arrive at PMEL within 2 months of notification to the contractor by PMEL of a problem and availability of float for shipping from PMEL, and (14) Contractor will be expected to assist PMEL by providing any unusual tools required for float modification or repair, as well as initial training (PMEL personnel may travel to a Contactor's facility at PMEL expense for this purpose) and subsequent advice for PMEL personnel in float testing and repair as requested by PMEL.  Desirable But Not Essential Instrument Features: (1) Floats capable of fractional volume change of 1.15% or more, sufficient to allow profiling between the surface and 2000 dbar, over the entire global (ice-free) ocean, (2) Floats with sufficient energy in their standard configuration to perform the above functions for more than 4 years with a duty cycle of 10 days, 3) Floats capable of self-activation upon deployment,  (4) Floats certifiable for air shipments (domestic and international), and (5) Floats certified for deployment on C-130 aircraft by U. S. Naval Oceanographic Office.

The resulting contract will be a firm fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one base year period and options for three additional one-year periods.  The minimum order amount will be 50 floats per year and the maximum order 500 floats per year.  The period of performance will begin on date of contract award (approx. 4/1/07).   A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be available on or about January 5, 2007, through this website.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.  It is incumbent upon interested parties to register at the solicitations site for notification and to review the site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  Technical questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed to Sharon.S.Kent@noaa.gov.  This requirement is advertised as full and open competition. All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a requirement for Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade international activities. The resulting suite of contracts will be called Global, Business, Trade, and Investment II (GBTI II). The USAID Bureau for Economic Growth and Trade (EGAT) is dedicated to reducing poverty and promoting prosperity in developing and transition countries.  EGAT is the USAID operational unit with a mandate to address development issues in economic growth, agriculture and trade in the developing world. Economic Growth (EG) is an office within EGAT, mandated to assist USAID field offices to develop and implement economic growth programs. EGATs goals are to raise incomes, end hunger, protect the environment, and equip institutions and people with the knowledge and skills to build equitable and sustainable economies and societies. USAIDs primary program objectives focus on devising and implementing robust strategies to promote real economic growth, reduce poverty, graduate transitional countries from aid to trade, promote open and competitive markets, develop the private sector, and expand and mobilize private financing sources to supplement and eventually replace development assistance.  Contractors shall be expected to provide a full range of services to USAID Missions and to USAID/Washington in substantially all major areas of business, trade and investment development and reform. USAID intends on awarding several Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) through an unrestricted and restricted (small-business set-aside) best-value competition.  The IQCs will have an ordering period of 5 years. USAID anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about July 20, 2005 with an estimated response date of August 22, 2005. For solicitation number M-OAA-EGAT-EMD-05-1529 proposals will be accepted from all responsible sources.  For solicitation
M-OAA-EGAT-EMD-05-1534 proposals will only be accepted from small businesses.  A small business is not limited to submitting a proposal under both solicitations but only one award will be made. Awards to small businesses, made under the unrestricted solicitation, will not have small-business set-aside status when task orders are issued under the resulting contracts. Both solicitations will be available on or after July 20, 2005 and will be posted solely on www.fedbizopps.gov.  No hard copies of the solicitations will be mailed. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6 million. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information.  Interested parties requiring further information should e-mail
E. Darlene Bullock, Contracting Officer, at dbullock@usaid.gov.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This is a two-step design/build construction project, Request for Proposals, Number N40083-07-R-0006.

It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services including all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required for the design and construction of Parking Facilities and Utility Relocation, Federal Health Care Facility, North Chicago, Illinois.   The project includes construction of a parking structure and surface parking, new access and Green Bay Road intersection including coordination with IDOT and relocation of utilities for the existing North Chicago Veteran?s Affairs Medical Center (NCVAMC).  The successful proposer will be required to validate the design against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).  The RFP will provide the project program, site survey, hazardous materials investigations, and prescriptive and performance specifications.  The RFP will not include a floor plan or design solution. 

The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction and the annual size standard is NTE $28.5 Million.  Estimated cost of this potential contract is between $15,000,000 and $17,500,000.  

Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available for viewing and downloading on or about December 28, 2006.  Proposal due date is January 19, 2007, 2:00 p.m. Central Time.  The solicitation is formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build section procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors? proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

This solicitation will consist of two (2) phases.  Phase I is the qualification phase.  Up to five (5) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II.  The Navy will determine which offerors proceed to Phase II.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:  Relevant Project Experience and Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort, and Management Approach.  

Upon determination of the contractors advancing to Phase II, those offerors will receive an RFP containing current and future design specifications.  Phase II will include the following evaluation factors:  Relevant Project Experience and Past Performance/Technical Qualifications/Small Business/Management Approach (same as Phase I unless conditions change); Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort; Conceptual Design; Durability, Maintainability, Sustainability of Building Systems; Project Schedule and Phasing; and Price.  

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  All prospective offerors and plan rooms MUST register themselves on the website.  The download time may be excessive, but all contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the Internet, if necessary.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore it is the offerors? responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.  

Offers will not be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of the offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  

This procurement is being advertised for one solicitation resulting in the award of one firm-fixed price design/build construction contract.  Request For Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  This procurement involves all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision for the design and construction work necessary to provide for a 13,000 square meter Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Facility that supports the C 130 mission at Keesler AFB, Biloxi, MS.

The facility will include maintenance squadron, propulsion, aircraft ground equipment, maintenance supply, aircraft part storage, mobility areas, and Readiness Spares Storage.  The project also includes parking for 200 personnel and demolition of Hanger 5.  The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $23,000,000 and $30,000,000.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  

Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in the award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel on Design Team and Construction Team, and Management Approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.

The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel on Design Team and Construction Team, and Technical Solution.  

This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Proposers should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for an Emergency Public Address System (EPAS) that is to be installed at the Greenbelt facility, in Greenbelt, Maryland.  The EPAS will support emergency preparedness communications requirements in addition to routine day-to-day facility and security communication needs across the center.   NASA/GSFC intends to enter into a Lease-to-Purchase agreement with Siemens Communications Federal Solutions Group for the installation and maintenance of the EPAS.  Siemens is currently the sole maintainer of the infrastructure and cable plants communications infrastructure for the Greenbelt facility.  Siemens possesses an intimate knowledge of GSFC's unique infrastructure and support requirements because they have designed and installed the facilities, outside and inside cable plants and currently maintain all as-built drawings and wiring schematics that support the hardware connecting the switches, as well as all of the communications closets.  As the sole maintainer of the Greenbelt facility cable plant, Siemens has unrestricted access to provide for additions, repairs, and design of all the outside and inside cable plants on the Greenbelt facility. This knowledge of the existing cable plant is invaluable since the EPAS will use the existing, available GSFC copper cable to access each of the buildings from the header equipment that will be installed in key buildings. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 27, 2006.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The USAF Electronic Systems Center 642nd Electronic System Squadron (642 ELSS, formerly the Force Protection System Squadron) at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA is supporting a new effort named the Joint Force Protection Advanced Security System (JFPASS) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD).  Recent DoD studies have found that current technologies, as employed, do not provide a comprehensive, integrated, and sustainable Joint Force Protection capability.  The goal of JFPASS is to address these shortcomings in a potentially $60M JCTD to begin in FY 08.  As a precursor to the JCTD, all four services are teaming to conduct a Joint Experiment (JE) in FY 07.  This experiment will be an on-going activity at Eglin AFB, FL, but it will be highlighted by several high profile equipment demonstrations.  This RFI is to gauge industries' interest in partnering with the Government in the conduct of this JE, by way of loaning equipment for the JE.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE PURCHASE ORDER  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Safety Research will hold the fourth National Occupational Injury Research Symposium (NOIRS) on October 21-23, 2008 in Pittsburgh, PA.  This notice announces the Governments intent to issue a purchase order, on a sole-source basis to Sheraton Hotel Station Square, Pittsburgh, PA, based on our market survey of available facilities in the selected location.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  Hotels that believe they can provide a suitable facility are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the publication date of this synopsis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  

The  NOIRS symposium must be held on the exact dates of October 21-23, 2008, so to be considered, an alternate offeror will need to confirm availability of these dates in their response to this notice.  

To open this requirement for competition,  another hotel would need to confirm availability of their facility on October 21-23, 2008, in writing and demonstrate that they can provide all required accommodations as follows.   We require a hotel which can accommodate 350 participants with hotel room arrangements and on-site parking accommodations for at least 150 of the travelers.  The hotel must be located in close proximity to an international airport to accommodate international, as well as national travelers and have a meeting room that will house the open and closing plenary sessions for 400 people.  The hotel Lobby must be large enough to hold registration tables for 350 attendees.  We require a facility which  is able to hold six consecutive breakout/speaker sessions on each day of the event.  Each session will accommodate at least 75 people per room, set up theater style with 5 feet isles minimum.   Rooms should isolate sound well enough not to disturb adjacent room presentations.  Breakout rooms need to be in close proximity to one another so that large groups of attendees can simultaneously move from one speaker session to the next very quickly.   Our preference is that all sessions be on one floor, however a first and second floor arrangement that does not require the use of an elevator would be acceptable.   In addition, a Speaker Room will be needed for 3 ? days (Oct. 20-23) and a Press Room that can be locked 24 hours will be needed for 3 ? days (Oct 20-23).  A Poster Session will be held on the first evening of the conference and must  be housed in a room that can accommodate 350 people in addition to Fifty (50) 4 ft x 8 ft poster boards and refreshments.   Audio/visual requirements and on-site catering services will be required.   This hotel must be ADA accessible.  We also desire entertainment, shopping and additional restaurant accommodations within walking distance of the facility and On-Site parking is preferred.  Satellite parking and/or shuttle service in lieu of on-site parking may be considered, but in an overall evaluation would be less advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered. 
   
Any response to this notice must demonstrate the hotel's ability to meet the requirements above and shall be submitted to Rebecca Mullenax, Mail Stop-General Delivery, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, RMullenax@cdc.gov, 304/285-5880, fax 304/285-6083.   The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional sources are available.   If no responses are received within 10 days, award to the Sheriton Hotel, Station Square, Pittsburgh, PA will be made without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<ARCHDATE>02262007
<CONTACT>Cheryl Lowery, (301) 619-7150
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a contract to Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA for supplies and reagents that have been optimized for 51 highly specialized items of equipment at the Armed Forces Insti tute of Pathology, Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, Washington, DC.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The r eagents are equipment-specific for DNA sequencing, quantitation, typing and amplification with primers, polymerases, terminators, and the like.  Contract award is expected January 2007. The total estimated value of the contract, including a base year and f our one-year option periods is $3,826,272.61.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by contacting Ms. Cheryl Lowery at Cheryl.Lowery@us.army.mil.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive  proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of dete rmining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Control No. 07-004 Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition Justification 1.  Requiring Activity:  Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Washington, DC; Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5014. The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is the U.S. Army Me dical Research Acquisition Activity in support of the AFIP (DNA Identification Laboratory), Washington, DC. 2.  Description of Action:  This approval is being requested to award a new firm fixed price requirements contract using Operation and Maintenance-Army (OMA) funds to Applera (d.b.a. Applied Biosystems (AB).    3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) requires supplies and reagents that have been optimized for 51 highly specialized items of equipment at AFDIL.  The reagents must be equipment-specific for DNA se quencing, quantitation, typing and amplification with primers, polymerases, terminators, and the like.   The total estimated value of the contract, including four one-year option periods is $3,826,272.61. 4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services wi ll satisfy agency requirements and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy the Agency Requirements.   5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  AFIPs mission requires consistent and standardization of testing to accomplish their overall mission and to maintain credibility, therefore, accuracy is critical to AFIP's mission.  The AFDIL is equipped with 51 instrument s that are optimized to specifically operate with AB reagents, some of which are protected by patents and trademarks.   Vital to the DNA identification mission is the need for reproducible and accurate test results with no lot to lot variability as determi ned through extensive internal validation studies.   The sequencing, typing, amplification, quantitation, and other stages of DNA identification process are performed using reagents compatible with the specific analysis laboratory equipment/instruments. Comparable products with even the very slightest differences would compromise the compatibility and consistency of DNA identification, void instrument warrantees, and shut down the laboratory for 6-12 months while new reagents are tested and validated.  Ad ditionally, SOPs would have to be re-written for 51 pieces of Gove rnment-owned equipment critical for AFIP to execute its mission.  Competition would involve substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Not applicable.  No effort will be made to solicit offers from as many potential sources as practicable as there is only one source capable of providing the supplies and reagents for 51 highly specialized scientific inst ruments.  The use of any other manufacturers reagents requires various validation procedures involving significant man-hours and efforts lasting approximately 6 to 8 months, during which time the normal daily operation of Identification of US service memb ers using DNA will be suspended.  Bringing competitor products online would also involve rewriting of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Quality Control procedures.  AFDIL is an American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accredited forens ic lab, which means the FBIs Quality Assurance Document is followed.  Based on accreditation adherence (section IV of the Master Operating Plan and the FBIs QAS document), all reagents and equipment must be developmentally validated by the company and in ternally validated by the laboratory as well as pass a stringent quality control before being released for casework. 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Because of the mandate that amplification and extraction reagents be acquired from the same firm who manufactured the DNA sequencing, quantifying, typing and amplifying with primers, polymerases, terminators, etc. equi pment, there can be no effective competition for subsequent acquisitions.  8.  Market Research:  Prior to the decision to implement a product into the laboratory at AFDIL, extensive validation studies are performed to determine which product possesses the desired properties.  Reagents and consumables are compared and tested for s ensitivity, ease of use, consistency, cost, and compatibility with the existing instrumentation used in the lab.  Since AFDIL not only works on identification cases but also on evidence to be presented in criminal trials in courts nationwide, as well as in ternationally, all the reagents and consumables used in the laboratory need to be approved for use in processing forensic casework based on Fry and Dalbert Hearings.  Although similar products are on the market, not all products have the ability to be uphe ld in the courts and have the general acceptance of the forensic community.  In addition, the use of products which are not recommended by the manufacturer of the instrumentation used will void all warranties on the respective equipment and invalidate the service contracts.  AFDIL tests and compares each product used and makes its decision based on its internal studies and on the studies of international forensic community. 9.  Interested Sources:  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (14), a notice was published in FEDBIZOPPS announcing the Government's intent to acquire the amplification and extraction reagents from Applera on a non-competitive basis.  The announcement identifie d the Government's reasoning for accomplishing this award without competition.  After appearing for fifteen (15) calendar days, no sources indicated any interest in pursuing this requirement. 10.  Other Facts:        Procurement History:  A previous requirements contract for these reagents was administered and issued by NARCO-WRAMC.  The contract number was DADA1501D0064.  It expired September 30, 2006.  It was awarded in a non-competitive manner.  That contract w as also awarded citing the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1 and utilizing the same rationale as is contained in this document.

The foundation is a spread footing type system.  The interior of the building houses several Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) areas, necessitating special design and construction criteria and procedures, as  well as a formal certification after construction is completed.  The majority of the interior spaces are on raised computer floors.  Extensive infrastructure (roads, parking areas, and utilities) are required because the facility is located in a newer area of the Base.

Offerors that submit white papers that are co nsistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the Government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two).  The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may pre clude the chance for award.  White papers submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A white papers technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  White papers will be accepted continuously through 13 February 2007.   The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups: 1. Time, Space, Position Information (TSPI) Applications, 2. Real Time Measurements at System and Sub-System Levels, 3. No a priori World Model (e.g. Battlespace ) - development of maps/models required for a UAS to view its Battlespace., 4. Flexible, Timely, and Efficient Communications, 5. Power/Energy Management to Support UAST, 6. Sensing and Perception for UAST, 7. Command and Control (C2) Test Networks for Mul tiple UAS Platforms, 8. Multi-Sensor/Multi-Modal Data Fusion, 9. UAS Collaboration in System of Systems (SoS) / Family of Systems (FoS), 10. Emergent Behavior/Complex Systems - development of predictive techniques of how UAS performance modifications may b e produced by external stimuli, changes in the environment or other factors, 11. Network Centric/Information Networks, 12. Ensuring Safety in all Battlespaces, 13. Information/ Knowledge Processing and Management and 14. Modeling Unstructured/Dynamic Envir onments.         OFFEROR INFORMATION: Evaluations may take up to 60 days from receipt of White Paper to complete.    Numerous awards may result from this BAA and will depend upon the quality and merit of white papers and proposals received and available fu nding.

<CONTACT>Leslie Leavitt Purchasing Agent 7022938368     LLeavitt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Mr. Martin P. Einert for specialized planning consultation services.  This purchase order is an extension of contract 06PG303012 and will continue the services as outlined in the Statement of Work as described below.  Mr. Einert is a civil engineer with 35 years of experience in planning and evaluating water resource management projects.  As a former planner for Reclamation's Lower Colorado Regional Office, Mr. Einert gained detailed knowledge of Lower Colorado Regional water resource management issues, as well as an intimate knowledge of and experience with managing projects through the planning process. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is December 28, 2006.  Questions may be directed to Leslie Leavitt at (702) 293-8368 or email to: lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov or Carmen Bernhardt at (702) 293-8309 or email to:  cbernhardt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million. Sole Source Justification:  Mr. Einert is a civil engineer with more than 35 years of experience in planning and evaluating water resource management projects.  As a former planner for Reclamation's Lower Colorado Regional Office, Mr. Einert has detailed knowledge of Lower Colorado Regional water resource management issues as well as intimate knowledge of and experience with managing projects through the planning process.  Mr. Einert's 24 years of specialized experience in coordination of interdisciplinary planning teams for Reclamation and coordination with a wide variety of public and private stakeholders and partners to accomplish study objectives; and his expert knowledge of Reclamation, law, policies, and guidance pertaining to planning projects in the Lower Colorado Region have been determined to be invaluable to the Government in meeting their needs. STATEMENT OF WORK PLANNING CONSULTING SERVICES MARTIN P. EINERT General Information The Planning and Program Management Group has responsibility for regional oversight and coordination of the Planning Investigations Program conducted in the Lower Colorado Region of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation).  There are currently three planning positions in the Group in which the incumbents are responsible for managing individual studies within the geographic areas of southern Nevada, southern Utah, and northwestern Arizona.  The planners are responsible for seeking and developing general planning investigations activities and providing technical guidance and assistance to a wide variety of interested parties for the geographically defined programs within the Lower Colorado Region.  The planners are responsible for the full range of project management responsibilities related to formulation and implementation of water resource management studies from inception through completion.  This includes coordination with multidisciplinary teams, coordination with external Reclamation partners, coordination of public involvement activities, development and implementation of plans of study and study tasks, budget formulation and management, scheduling of activities, and adherence with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, directives and standards, policies, and guidelines related to Reclamation's Planning Investigations Program.  The planners are responsible for completing the appropriate level of study associated with their respective studies and ensuring that study findings are appropriately documented.   The general purpose of a water resource management study is to identify a water supply issue of concern to Reclamation and its constituents with the intent of formulating reasonable and acceptable alternatives for solution to the posed issue.  It is important to note that no two planning studies are alike, and the process of performing planning investigations is complex with a significant learning curve.  It takes an average of 2 to 3 years to become sufficiently familiar with Reclamation's planning process in order to independently manage water resource management studies.  The time required to complete an "average" planning investigation is 5 years; more complex studies may take as long as 10 to 12 years to complete.  Levels of study associated with planning investigations include reconnaissance, appraisal, special, and/or feasibility.  Appropriate documentation for planning investigations includes scopes of work, plans of study, plan formulation working documents, preliminary findings reports, planning reports, definite plan reports, appraisal reports, special reports, and feasibility reports, each of which serves a different purpose and must be prepared in a particular manner which meets the intent of the study objectives and applicable Federal laws and regulations.   Scope of Work In order to meet current workload requirements, the continuing planning consulting services of Mr. Martin P. Einert are being sought to furnish specialized planning experience to the staff of the Planning and Program Management Group.   Retention of Mr. Einert's planning expertise will allow the Group's planners the opportunity to be guided and facilitated through the planning process by an expert.  Mr. Einert will provide hands-on guidance to our staff for administering new and ongoing planning projects.  This may include all or a portion of the following tasks: (a).  detailed analysis of Federal laws, regulations, policies, and guidance pertaining to Reclamation's Planning Investigations Program (b).  detailed analysis of the types of planning investigations that Reclamation conducts (reconnaissance, appraisal, special, and feasibility) and the requirements associated with each type of study (c).  analysis and practices associated with establishing interdisciplinary study teams and coordinating those teams to complete planning investigations (d).  engaging in dialogue with potential and/or current Reclamation constituents (e).  forming new partnerships and/or maintaining existing partnerships for purposes of completing new and ongoing planning investigations (f).   pre-scoping of water resource management issues (g).  detailed study of process and techniques associated with the evaluation of alternatives for addressing water resource management issues (h).  development and formulation of planning investigations budget proposals for new and ongoing projects (i).   project management tools essential to conducting planning investigations, such as budget development and management, scheduling of tasks, and documentation of study requirements and findings (j).  development and formulation of various documents associated with planning studies, such as briefing statements, issue statements, detailed narratives, capability statements, and fact sheets (k).  coordination of public involvement programs (l).   ensuring regulatory requirements associated with planning studies are met (m).  addressing environmental, political, and institutional issues of studies (n).  documenting study progress and findings in a manner that meets study objectives and Federal requirements (emphasis placed on report writing) (o).  other special projects, as needed (such as coordination of the administrative record for the All-American Canal lawsuit).

To fulfill this responsibility, DTIC established multiple Information Analysis Centers (IACs), which operate in accordance with DoD Instruction 3200.14.  In support of these IACs, DTIC is the Program Management Office (PMO) for various contracts, including SP0700-98-D-4000, also known as Data and Analysis Center for Software (DACS ).  The Department of Defense (DoD) Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program operates in accordance with DoD 3200.14, Principles and Operational Parameters of the DoD Scientific and Technical Information Program, 13 May 1997.  DoD IACs function as specialized subject focal points and shall operate in accordance with all directives, instructions, regulations and military standards as appropriate.  Specific details regarding IACs can be found in DoD 3200.14.  This document may be accessed online at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/320014.htm.  Enclosure 5 of DoD 3200.14 provides a formal overview of the IAC program including the functions and responsibilities of IACs.  Each requirement listed under Background/New Requirement, below, has/will have the core operation of an IAC.

Technical Area Task (TAT):  Technical Area Tasks are not a part of the core funded amount on the contract, rather they are individual tasks funded by other government organizations and are based on need and availability of funds.  These TATs are defined in the contract as an estimated cost contract line item and are not funded.  Individual Delivery Orders are awarded against the contract for the performance of each individual TAT.  The Government does not guarantee the issuance of any TAT against the contract.  Reference DoD 3200.14 for a more in-depth definition of the Technical Area Tasks.

<DESC>Request for Information Power Source Systems Roadmapping This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to thi s RFI.   The DoD Power Sources Technology Working Group (PSTWG) and the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP), is sponsoring a workshop dedicated to the silver zinc primary, reserve and secondary battery technology as they apply to DoD applications.   Participation is open to representative from U.S. industry, academic organizations, and other government agencies regarding silver oxide zinc batteries.   Potential areas of discussion during the workshop include: 1. Users (government and prime contractor) requirements for silver zinc batteries as they apply to supporting existing weapon system platforms. 2.  Potential applications for this technology in weapon systems under development. 3.  Challenges (technical, manufacturing, cost) to increasing the wider use of silver zinc batteries in military application. 4.  Status of the domestic production base and the impact of diminishing sources of supply. 5.  Ongoing R&D efforts and future trends 6.  Potential avenues for joint government/prime contractor/battery manufacturer efforts/partnering 	A 2-day workshop is scheduled for January 23 and 24, 2006 in the Washington DC area.  Due to make this workshop as productive as possible, participation is by invitation only and will be limited to those individuals and organizations that are considered t o have the ability to provide useful input to the discussion areas.

Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than HIV. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics that is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. 

The Division also supports substantial preclinical research efforts to develop new therapeutics. It is anticipated that these efforts will produce many promising investigational products that will require initial testing in humans in Phase I clinical trials. In order to ensure the capacity to evaluate the growing pipeline of investigational products as they become available, it is critical for DMID to establish the dedicated resources necessary to undertake Phase 1 clinical trials for a broad range of infectious diseases. 

The NIAID is seeking capability statements from sources that are capable of the providing and managing of a Phase I Clinical Trial Unit for Therapeutics Against Infectious Diseases to fill this need. This phase I unit will operate under Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and will provide and support electronic data capture system.

NIAID anticipates that minimum of four (4) protocols will be implemented in each year of the contract. Each protocol will include pK/pD and safety evaluation of investigational therapies. It is estimated that 150 healthy adults (18 ? 45 of age) will be recruited each year, and at least 45% of those will be from minority groups. The clinical protocols and all additional clinical documents needed (such as CRFs, MOP, etc) will be developed by the potential source. The potential source will also provide independent monitoring abilities, electronic data capturing ability and data management capacity. 

Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:  
1.	relevant experience in conducting pK/pD and safety first in human trials of novel therapeutics under Good Clinical Practices (GCP);
2.	ability to recruit the needed patient populations;
3.	ability to provide independent monitoring;
4.	ability to provide and maintain electronic data capturing system;
5.	capacity and facilities to perform inpatient trials;
6.	relevant experience in development clinical protocols and associated clinical documents;
7.	relevant experience and expertise of personnel and adequacy of relevant training.



Interested organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by December 28, 2006.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

<CONTACT>Maxine Hodges, Acquisition Support (ERIMAX), Phone 301-763-3263, Fax 301-457-8465, Email maxine.r.hodges@census.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau seeks qualified sources with the capabilities for providing data on all construction projects in the U.S. that are in the contract award or start stage.  The objective of this requirement is to obtain the most comprehensive database of construction project information available.  The required data is used as a source for developing samplings for Census Bureau surveys for determining the value of construction put in place.  The data is prepared for direct entry into the gross domestic product (GDP) and are used extensively by other Government agencies and the private sector. 

The measurement of the value put in place involves a family of surveys and data sources designed to compile the amount of work put in place for each classification of construction. Classifications of construction are based on ownership and/or primary use of the project or complex of structures on a property. Construction is defined as the building or site fabrication of permanent structures and facilities including additions, alterations and major replacements, but excluding maintenance and repairs. The value of work put in place is the aggregate of materials, labor, overhead and profit charged to a construction operation including the value of architectural and engineering services associated with the construction operation.  The statistics on the value of construction put in place result from direct measurement and indirect estimation. A series results from direct measurement when it is based on reports of the actual value of construction progress or construction expenditures obtained from complete records or sample surveys. Indirectly estimated series are developed by using related construction statistics.  

The required data includes the following fields: (i) Description with detailed type of construction code; (ii) Location; (iii) Valuation; (iv) Ownership designation (private, state, local, or federal); (v) Type of project (new, addition, or alteration); (vi) Square feet of floor space; (vii) Owner name, address, and telephone number; (viii) Name, address, and telephone number of other project officials (architect, contractor, engineer, etc.); and (ix) Contract number.  The data must be updated monthly, by the 3rd workday of each month, and be submitted in a flat ASCII file.  Minimum coverage is 60 percent of all construction projects in the U.S. at the contract award or start stage, and 80 percent of all construction projects in the U.S. valued over $10M.  The data must be auditable to verify coverage and sortable by geographic regions.  Sources must also provide a means for producing customized reports and access by Internet.  

Interested parties should submit a detailed statement of their qualifications, not exceeding 25 pages, for providing the required support by e-mail to Maxine.R. Hodges at Maxine.R.Hodges@census.gov by 3:00pm, EST, Thursday, January 4, 2007.  The Government will assess all submissions received by the closing date for the purpose of determining an appropriate acquisition and sourcing strategy for procuring the requirement.  Submissions may be submitted by mail or electronically.  The Government point of contact is Ms. Maxine R. Hodges, who may be reached at Maxine.R.Hodges@census.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- Sole Source Justification Notification - 7TF-07-0012
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service (FTS) intends to award a firm fixed price IDIQ contract on a sole source basis to NEC, located at DFW Airport.  Please see the following sole source justification for further explanation.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

(1)Identification of the Agency, Contracting Activity, and Document being approved:  J&A Number:  7T4HP06003
Procurement Office: General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service (FTS)
GSA FTS Project: DFW Airport 7TF-07-0012
Estimated Dollar Value: $950,000.00
(2) Nature or Description of the Action: 
This Justification and Approval authorizes and approves the sole source award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for local telecommunication services at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) to NEC Unified Solutions, Inc. (NEC). 
(3) Description of supplies or services required to meet the agency's need:  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) located at DFW Airport currently obtains their local telecommunication services at Terminal D directly from DFW International Airport Board (DFWIAB) due to the non-availability of any GSA FTS telecommunication services contract vehicle for federal customers located within DFW.  The proposed procurement action would establish a sole source FFP IDIQ contract with NEC in order to supply the TSA and GSA's other federal customers with local telecom service at the DFW Airport.  The proposed contract would provide telecom services similar to those included under other GSA FTS telecom contracts (i.e., MAA, LSA, etc.).  The proposed contract will only provide services within the geographical boundaries of the DFW International Airport.
(4) Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: Statute Cite 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR Cite 6.302-1, Exception: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
(5) Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:  NEC currently operates and maintains DFW's Public Branch Exchange (PBX) under the DFWIAB's Contract Number 7003598 that was awarded by DFWIAB to NEC on July 21, 2004.  The contract performance period includes a five (5) year base period and three (3) one (1) year option periods representing a total period of eight (8) years.  NEC also manages billing services under the DFWIAB contract.  The DFWIAB was created April 15, 1968, by the Cities of Dallas and Fort Worth pursuant to the Texas Municipal Airports Act (now Transportation Code, Chapter 22).  The DFWIAB has sole jurisdiction over any and all entities within the geographic boundaries of DFW.  TSA and other Federal agencies that have a presence at the DFW airport are there to support their mission of security and of upholding federal laws and regulations.  TSA and all other Terminal D federal tenants/lessees currently procure their telecommunications services directly from the DFWIAB in accordance with the terms and conditions of their leases.  Terminal D opened on July 23, 2005.  A migration of all DFW terminals, business center, and other outlying buildings within DFW to the PBX is currently in process and will eventually require all telecom services to be obtained via the NEC PBX.
GSA FTS cannot provide telecommunication services to TSA or other federal customers located at DFW Airport due to the DFWIAB's contract with NEC.  Because of the DFWIAB's jurisdiction and authority, they will only allow GSA FTS to contract with NEC, the DFWIAB's sole provider of telecom services at DFW International Airport.  Accordingly, the DFWIAB has authorized GSA FTS to establish a contract directly with NEC to supply TSA and other federal customers with value added telecom service at DFW Airport's Terminal D, and eventually all locations (terminals) of DFW served by the PBX.
(6) Description of Efforts to Solicit as Many Offers as Practicable or Exception:  Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers solicited from as many potential sources as practicable, including whether a FEDBIZOPS notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR 5.2:  FEDBIZOPS notice of intent to award a sole source contract was posted on April 14, 2006. 
(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated costs to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  A complete analysis of all costs will be utilized prior to award.  Additionally, DFWIAB's contract with NEC utilized a best value methodology and was competitively awarded under the provisions of the State of Texas Local Government Code Chapter 252, Purchasing and Contracting Authorities of Counties. and was governed by Chapter 252 Subsection C's procedures for competitive sealed proposals.  Accordingly, the prices contained within the DFWIAB contract can be used as one basis for a fair and reasonable price determination for the proposed GSA FTS contract. 
(8) Description of market research conducted and the results or statement of the reason market research was not conducted:  
Market research included a thorough review of all acquisition alternatives, including the possibility of utilizing NEC's GSA FSS Schedule 70 under a BPA scenario.  No other alternative was feasible.  NEC's schedule 70 does not support the specific unique requirements required under a local telecom support contract and the DFWIAB precludes any other contractor from directly providing these services.  The sole source open market award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) IDIQ contract to NEC represents the best solution to fulfill the requirement.
(9) Other facts supporting other than full and open competition:  
Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been available or are not available:  No suitable alternatives are available because of the DFWIAB's jurisdiction and authority.  DFWIAB will only allow GSA FTS to contract with NEC, the DFWIAB's sole provider of DFWIAB telecom services at DFW International Airport.
(10) List of sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:  Initial Sources Sought Posted:  4/14/2006.  The following contractors responded: Winstar Government Solutions, LLC
ClarkTel Communications Corporation SpectraLink Corporation. 
All three companies listed above are small businesses.  Winstar inquired as to whether they could work with NEC and GSA so that their company, the only minority owned national CLEC, could participate in providing service to DFW Airport.  ClarkTel was interested in GSA awarding directly to them under the 8(a) Program.  SpectraLink Corporation was interested if any consideration had been given to include wireless phone integration with the PBX at DFW airport.  All of the inquiries reflected an obvious misunderstanding of the rationale for a sole source contract with NEC as delineated in the FEDBIZOPS announcement.  The contracting officer replied to each inquiry, restating what was already explained in the synopsis, and further clarified that the DFWIAB already has a contract with NEC, that the PBX is already in place, and the DFWIAB was only authorizing GSA FTS to establish a contract with NEC for the benefit of federal government customers located within DFW.  All three companies replied and acknowledged the explanation.  No further inquiries have been submitted.
Due to a delay in project milestones, this special notice is being issued via FedBizOpps for notification purposes only.
(11) Statement of Actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to overcome barriers of competition before any subsequent acquisition for the services or supplies    required:  Currently, NEC is the only known source capable of meeting the agency's requirement.  Because of the DFWIAB's jurisdiction and authority, DFWIAB will only allow GSA FTS to contract with NEC, the DFWIAB's sole provider of telecom services at DFW International Airport.  If it is determined at a later date that DFWIAB will permit another source or other sources to provide the required services, the Government will use competitive procedures to the maximum extent practicable.
(12) Statement of delivery requirements:  Estimated.
January 2, 2007 - September 30, 2008 (Base Period)
October 1, 2008 - September 30, 2009 (Option 1)
October 1, 2009 - September 30, 2010 (Option 2)

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of a Final Drug Product for a Mixture of Monoclonal Antibodies for Types A, B and E Botulinum Neurotoxins
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, DHHS, intends to negotiate a multiple-year contract to develop a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based treatment for botulism caused by botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B and E (BoNT/ A/B/E) with XOMA, LLC, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.  XOMA is currently developing three MAbs (NX01, NX02 and NX11) that potently neutralize BoNT subserotypes A1 and A2 under contract N01-AI-60008.  The proposed contract will identify MAbs that potently neutralize BoNT/B and E (and their major subserotypes), develop those MAbs for commercial production, and formulate a final drug product that potently neutralizes BoNT/A/B and E and includes the three BoNT/A MAbs (NX01, NX02 and NX11). 

XOMA is in a unique position to immediately continue the development of this high priority biodefense product.  To develop NX01, NX02 and NX11, XOMA fused human variable region sequences (generated by Dr. James Marks, UCSF and accessed through a material transfer and evaluation agreement with UCSF) to XOMA's proprietary modular antibody expression vectors containing light and heavy chain constant regions. The use of this same antibody framework for new BoNT/B and E MAbs may significantly increase the likelihood that the additional MAbs will share physical/chemical characteristics with NX01, NX02 and NX11, and, therefore increase the likelihood that they can be formulated together.  The co-formulation of a large number of MAbs is novel and could present a technical hurdle to this program and thus any technical approaches that increase the likelihood of successfully co-formulating the MAbs should be pursued.  The proprietary XOMA framework has been used in MAbs that have been evaluated in humans for safety and immunogenicity and were shown to be safe and relatively non-immunogenic. XOMA has experience with all of the assays that are required to characterize the MAbs, including the mouse neutralization assay.  XOMA's proprietary technology includes the commercial expression cell line that was used to produce the Master Cell Bank and the Working Master Cell Bank for the three BoNT/A MAbs.  The use of the same cell line for expression of the BoNT/B and E MAbs will streamline the regulatory pathway for the approval of these MAbs to be evaluated in humans. In summary, applying identical technology to the new BoNT/B and E MAbs will reduce the timeframe for their development, increase the likelihood that all the MAbs can be formulated together, reduce the risk of safety/immunogenicity problems, and streamline the regulatory review. This project has not been reviewed by the Board of Scientific Counselors as required.  Such review will occur prior to technical evaluation.  Thus potential offerors are cautioned that cancellation of this RFP due to disapproval by the Board of Scientific Counselors is a possibility.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by the closing date noted above. See Numbered Note 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS  NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is EA1330-07-RQ-0074.  The U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Mission Support Division, Norfolk, Virginia has a requirement to purchase the following equipment:  (1)  25,854 ft. of  Electromechanical Cable in accordance with the following specifications:  

NOAA Electromechanical Cable Requirements


Introduction:

The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations Center, Atlantic and Pacific, uses electromechanical cable to lower various scientific instruments over the side of their oceangoing research vessels.  The cables support the instruments and provide the means for electrical signals to pass between the instruments and the vessel.  It is typically called "CTD wire".

The following specifications describe in general terms the significant characteristics the cable design must have.  No priority is implied by the order given.

General:

An electromechanical cable is required to lower various scientific instruments over the side of an oceangoing research vessel.  The cable shall be capable of safely lowering an instrument to 6,000?m water depth in the dynamic environment caused by ship and wave motion, and lowering/raising speeds of 70 m/min.  Multiple conductors are required for the real time transmission of electrical data and control signals and for redundancy.  The cable shall be capable of being stored under tension for long periods of time on single drum winches to multiple layers.  Resistance to crushing is desirable.  It is expected that payloads will frequently produce loading of the cable (both static + dynamic) approaching 50% of rated breaking strength (RBS).

The cable will be used with LEBUS grooved drum shell.  The cable must be compatible with existing LEBUS grooved shells for a Markey DESH-5, 38" width drum.  As listed below:

Winch 
(Manufacturer)	Model No.	Drum Width	Pitch	Number of 
Grooves
Markey	DESH-5	38?	0.329004	115.5
		38?	0.3	116.5
		38?	0.323404	117.5
		38?	0.3	118.5
		24?		
		24?		
	DESH-3	24?		73.5
		24?		74
	COM-7			
	DUSH-3			

After manufacture of the cable, a piece, approximately 30 meters in length will be sent by the manufacturer to Markey for determination of what Lebus will be necessary for the cable to be used on the Markey winches above.  The report from Markey detailing the recommended Lebus for the Markey winches showing the airgap for various pitch Lebuses and the loading/stretch data used to determine the airgap will be provided to the purchaser before the cable is shipped.  This report shall no more than $500 to the price of the cable.

Characteristics:

1)	Maximum strength attainable -- identified as the best possible ratio of strength to weight.  The ability of a cable to "survive" under extreme conditions is a function of its Rated or Ultimate Breaking Strain.

2)	Highest elastic limit attainable -- identified as the best possible ratio of elastic limit to weight.  This characteristic controls the mix of payload size, wire out, wire speed and environmental conditions at which the cable can operate with safety.  This applies to both strength and electrical components of the cable.

3)	High rotational stability -- identified as a minimal amount of axial rotation under loads cyclically varying from 0% to 45% of RBS.  Low rotation is considered necessary to avoid looping/hockling the cable on bottom contact or "Zero" tension conditions and to prevent excessive spinning of lowered instruments.  (A 'trade off' with item 15)

4)	High degree of armor stress balance -- identified as the absence or near absence of variations to the relative loading on inner and outer armors that produce strength degradation when one end of the cable is free to rotate.

5)	Minimum service life of 5 years -- the useful life in "normal" service assuming reasonable care and proper handling.

6)	Cable shall be capable of operating at:

>30% RBS for 90% of expected life.
>40% RBS for 70% of expected life.

7)	The cable shall be able to withstand occasional loading to 50% RBS without significant reduction in strength or change in electrical characteristics.

8)	The armor shall be galvanized.

9)	The cable shall have a finished O.D. of 8.1788 mm (0.322").

10)	The cable shall be in  two  unbroken lengths of 7,800 m (without splices).

11)	The cable shall be capable of operation with single drum winch systems where the cable is stored under tension.

12)	The cable shall be able to operate continuously (useful life) over sheaves not less than (NLT) 40 times the cable diameter without degradation in strength.

13)	The cable must be capable of withstanding repeated flexures over sheaves at the nominal working loads given in item 6 without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics.

14)	The cable shall be capable of withstanding cyclical loading in tension as results from ship motion without degradation in strength or change in electrical characteristics.

15)	The cable shall exhibit the best possible resistance to abrasion, both internal and external, consistent with the need for high rotational stability.  (A 'trade off' with Item 3)

16)	The cable shall exhibit the best possible resistance to corrosion, particularly crevice corrosion and hydrogen imbrittlement.

17)	The cable shall not unlay when cut, i.e. it must be well preformed.

18)	The cable shall be lubricated for abrasion and corrosion protection.  The lubricant should not extrude in use and be of non-petroleum base.

19)	The cable shall have multiple electrical conductors capable of efficient transmission of low power signals at frequencies < 20 kHz.  Cable design should be optimized to permit simultaneous transmission of 5 kHz and 10 kHz signals in a single conductor to armor circuit. 

Performance Specifications:

1)	Finished Diameter: - The finished diameter shall be 8.1788 mm (0.322") at a loading of 15% of RBS.  The diameter shall be uniform over the length of the cable with tolerances of (?0.0508 mm (0.002") and +0.076 mm (0.003")).

2)	Working Diameter: - The change in cable diameter due to a change in cable loading shall not exceed 2% of the finish diameter.  At a loading of 50% RBS the cable diameter shall not be less than 8.03 mm (0.316)".  

3)	Rotation: - The finished cable should not rotate about its axis more than 65 degrees per meter at 40% of RBS.  It is recognized that this requirement may not be met given the specified outer armor wire size and minimum sheave diameter.

4)	Rated Breaking Strength: - > 4500 Kg (10000 lbs) with one end free to rotate.

5)	Flexure Tolerance: - Withstand > 50,000 flexure cycles over sheaves 40 times wire O.D. at 35-40% of RBS without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS.  

6)	Tension Cycling: - Withstand > 50,000 cycles in tension from 10% to 40% of RBS at an 8 sec. period without failure of individual wires or degradation of electrical performance.  Degradation in strength shall not exceed 5% of RBS. 

7)	Sheave Size: - The cable shall be capable of operation with sheaves of tread diameter 38 cm (15").

8)	Cable Length: - The cable shall of an unbroken lengths of15,680 m without splices. Two lengths of 7,800 meters shall be delivered and 50 meters shall be used by manufacturer for the test required in the Reports section of this specification.

<DESC>Amendment 2 

Questions and Answers, Ref: Synopsis/Solicitation No. ITBPA2007

1. Please provide estimated award date.
There is no estimated award date at this time.  Award of the BPAs will depend on the number of proposals which are received.   Based upon the number of proposals we received last time, it may take up to 6 months.
 
2. Page 2 - In reference to the various specifications provided, can you please further clarify the following statement: ?The USPTO is not looking for vendors who can only offer a few products or product brands.? Can it be assumed that alternate product brands can be offered in lieu of the product brands listed or is this an all or nothing RFQ?

As stated in the synopsis/solicitation, ?Vendors who can only offer a few products and/or limited product brands will be found unacceptable, and will not be considered for award?.  A vendor which can only offer to sell the PTO, for example, security software, would be found unacceptable because it cannot offer a vast array of IT Products.   Since the purpose of this BPA is to fulfill future requirements which are unknown at this time, offering alternate products is not an option.  There will be no stated prices, or product brands listed in the awarded BPAs.  Requirements will be competed among the awarded BPA holders as the requirements are identified.  

3. E. (page 4) it says that ??the vendor must select 5 specifications to price?? does that mean we can just choose not to price those items that we are not authorized to sell?

In order to consider price, which is required, the vendor must price 5 specifications.  The vendor may price any of the specifications, regardless of whether or not it is authorized to sell the particular product.  However, once the BPAs are awarded, vendors must be authorized to sell the products which they are quoting.  As stated in the synopsis/solicitation, ?The prices will be used strictly for evaluation purposes only.? There will not be any orders resulting from this pricing.

4. Pages 3 and 4 - Under ?Supplemental Instructions? ?
Please clarify under B. if you are requesting past performance evaluations from trade references.
Reference Factor No. 2(a), the USPTO is requesting past performance evaluations from the vendor?s customers.  Customers could include companies, federal government agencies, state or local governments, etc., which the Offeror has sold IT products similar to those identified in the synopsis/solicitation.

5.  Please confirm you are asking for customer references under C. (regarding Factor No. 2(b). 
The USPTO is requesting ?customer references? under Factor No. 2(b), with whom the offeror has had an established relationship for over one year and has had sales for IT products in excess of $50,000 per year.

6.  Confirm that the NACIS code 443120 is for 500 employees or fewer is the small business size for this solicitation.
The nonmanufacturer size standard of 500 employees shall be used for purposes of Government procurement of supplies.  This BPA is for supplies; therefore, the small business size standard of 500 employees will apply.

7.  In regards to solicitation ITBPA2007 how many awards is the Patent and Trademark Office anticipating will be awarded?
It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  The USPTO wishes to remain flexible in the number of awards it may make.

8.  Please confirm that current BPA holders cannot submit a response to the new BPA solicitation.
The current BPA holders already have a BPA; therefore, it is not necessary to submit a proposal.  The current BPA awards, if all of the options are exercised, will extend out to 6/30/2009.  As a reminder, the previous combined synopsis/solicitation under which the current BPA holders were awarded stated ?the USPTO may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase existing BPAs to fulfill the USPTO?s requirements?.

9. Since our BPA expires in June of 2007, how do we continue our BPA beyond that time?
The current BPAs have two remaining options, if exercised, which will extend out to 6/30/2009. It is up to the USPTO if it wishes to exercise the options. 

10.  Will you provide extensions to current BPAs to match that of the new BPAs that you will be awarding in the future?
No.  The current BPAs were awarded with a basic period of two years, and three one-year options, for a potential of five years.  The new BPA will have a five-year period of performance, as with the previous BPAs.  It is unknown at this time whether the current BPAs will be allowed to expire on 6/30/2009, or re-competed.

11.  Will the Government contemplate relaxing the requirement in Item C of the Supplemental Instructions, Factor #2(b), to permit quotations from vendors with less than 5 long-standing customers at less than $50,000.00/year volume, and if so, what would the volume be?
No.  The USPTO has already lowered the requirement from the previous BPA. The previous BPA included the requirement that the company furnish references that had an established relationship for over one year, and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year.  

12. Attachment 2 ? Nortel Data Switches:  It appears that several of the specifications called out are obsolete technology and we assume that it is acceptable for us to bid the latest technology that will either meet or exceed the published specifications, could you please confirm that this is acceptable to the USPTO?
Yes. Specifically, the combined synopsis/solicitation stated:  ?If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.?

13.  Is this BPA based on an existing contract? 
There were BPAs awarded in 2004 for IT Products, the same as this.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued to add to those awarded in 2004.

14.   Does this Small Business Set-Aside BPA require products to be provided from small business manufacturers?  Will the non-manufacturer rule apply?
As the purpose of this RFQ is to establish a BPA and specific requirements are not identified at this time, the nonmanufacturer rule does not apply. If it is determined necessary to seek a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule, the USPTO contracting officer will contact the SBA. 

15.   If we are a Prime on this BPA with a team of various small businesses that we currently partner with would all PO's come through our company (small business) or would they or could they go directly to some of our partners who are HUBZone, SDV-O, & Minority-owned to meet some of your socio-economic goals?
The BPA will be issued to the prime only and orders will only be issued to the prime.
  
16.   The RFP states that $30 million of IT purchased in FY 2006 were fulfilled by BPA Holders for IT products.  Please clarify if the $30 million is for the BPA currently being competed or does this figure include other IT BPA's?  
As stated in the synopsis/solicitation: ?The USPTO?s IT product requirements for FY 2006 were approximately $95.5 million, approximately $30 million of which was (emphasis added) fulfilled by the BPA Holders for IT Products.? No, the $30 million is not for the BPA currently being competed.  This is the amount of requirements which were fulfilled in FY2006 utilizing the existing BPAs.  The approximate figure of $30 million was disclosed so companies would have a better understanding of the volume that the USPTO procured in FY 2006 using the existing BPAs. 
 
17.  Reference Attachment 6 and 7 - PowerEdge 2850 and PowerEdge 1850:  Due to recent technology refreshes the PowerEdge 2850 and 1850 have recently been transitioned to the PowerEdge 2950 and 1950, we assume that it is acceptable for us to bid the latest technology that will either meet or exceed the published specifications, could you please confirm that this acceptable to the USPTO? 
Yes. Specifically, the combined synopsis/solicitation stated:  ?If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.?

18.  Reference Quotes for Dell PowerEdge 2860 servers:  Dell no longer offers the 2850, but offers the 2950.  In this case the specs for the 2950 are different.  Is there any chance the end user my issue new specs for these requests? 
New specs will not be issued since it is not the USPTO?s intent to issue any orders at this time. The purpose of providing the specifications for specific items is to obtain pricing information to conduct price evaluation. As specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, ?If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.?  

Reminder: The receipt date and time for proposals is 11:00 a.m. EST, January 3, 2007.   Updates to this synopsis/solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov), as well as the USPTO Office of Procurement homepage at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm.  This solicitation shall not be construed as a commitment of any kind.

<DESC>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY and AAPD-06-12 - HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION are hereby incorporated as an ammendment to the solicitation.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the mot recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
