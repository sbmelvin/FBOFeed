<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Description of Services: Contractor shall provide services to conduct Laboratory testing for water samples to the VA Caribbean Healthcare System, Hemodialysis Unit at Calle Casia, San Juan, Puerto Rico, 00921-3201, two (2) times a year. Contractor shall retrieve the samples collected by the local Medical Instrumentation Technicians (MIT) Dialysis and process the samples for the substances specified in the table below as per the American National Standard (ANSI) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)/ ISO 139559:2009, approved in 2011 by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Contractor will provide all necessary supplies as requisition forms and specimen containers; transport samples in such a manner as to ensure and protect the integrity of the specimen; analyze samples. Provide to the VA Caribbean Healthcare System Laboratory Service with a means of communication to permit immediate inquiry regarding the status of pending tests; turnaround time of test results should not be more than two (2) weeks and shall be received by mail.




The testing of water samples need to be tested every six (6) months if limits are met and additionally if corrections are required. To comply with dialysis regulations, purified dialysis water needs to be tested to verify it does not exceed the maximum limits of contaminants determined by AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation). Contractor shall advice the VA Caribbean Healthcare System of any changes in methodology, procedure, reference ranges and any new test introduced.  

Compliance with the requirements listed in Table 1 can be shown in one of three (3) ways:

1.	Where such testing is available, the individual contaminants in Table 1 can be determined using chemical analysis methods referenced by the American Public Health Association, methods referenced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and/or other equivalent analytical methods.

2.	Where testing for the individual trace elements listed in Table 1 is not available, and the source water can be demonstrated to meet the standards for potable water as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) or local regulations, an analysis for total heavy metals can be used with a maximum allowable level of 0.1 mg/l.


3.	If neither of these options is available, compliance with the requirements of Table 1 can be met by using water that can be demonstrated to meet the potable water requirements of the World Health Organization (WHO) (or local regulations and a reverse osmosis system with a rejection of > 90 % based on conductivity, resistivity or TDS. Samples shall be collected at the end of the water purification cascade or at the most distal point in each water distribution loop.

Incomplete or unreasonably priced offers will not be considered for award.  The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Note: Offers that are not technically acceptable cannot be selected, regardless of Price.
