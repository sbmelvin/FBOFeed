<SUBJECT>Q--Delivery of Respirator Fit Testing and Respirator Purchases for Members of the Commissioned Corps Readiness Force
<SOLNBR>0404AN32684
<RESPDATE>112503
<ARCHDATE>11092004
<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Office of Public Health and Science, an Office within U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which intends to competitively award a contract to provide respirator fit testing and respirators purchase for members of the Commissioned Corps Readiness Force and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from parties interested in proposing on this requirement..  PLEASE READ THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CAREFULLY.  INTRODUCTION.  The Government intends to award a combination of fixed price for equipment and time and materials-type contract for service and delivery.  The period of performance for this project is 60 days from the effective date of the contract, with an estimated cost range of $100,000 to $120,000.   The title of this project is CCRF Respiratory Protection Program.  BACKGROUND.  This Program shall apply to members of the Corps Readiness Force (CCRF) in the Intermediate and Advanced deployability categories and officers in the Commissioned Corps, who may be regarded as response assets in an emergency.  These officers should be fit-tested annually with a disposable air-purifying respirator (e.g., N-95).  It is felt that this level of respiratory protection will be appropriate for the majority of deployments and ensures that officers can be deployed fully protected against related risks associated with respiration of small particles.  Additional levels of respiratory protection, based on an assessment of the respiratory risk, will not be addressed in this proposal.  During the course of a deployment, officers may be exposed to biological agents that place them at risk for infection, injury, or illness.  A comprehensive program is necessary that will meet the critical respiratory protection needs of deployed officers.  A Respiratory Protection Program would apply to a variety of illnesses such as tuberculosis, influenza, or plague, and would provide guidance on the selection and wearing of appropriate respiratory protective devices for particulate contaminants.    This contract will address the medical evaluation, training, fit-testing, and record-keeping of up to 1,000 CCRF members during fiscal year 2004.  SCOPE OF WORK -- Deployed personnel must be adequately protected when responding to a public health need.  Protecting deployed Commissioned Corps officers against infectious disease (e.g., SARS) or other contaminants (e.g., particulates).  Qualified contractors must offer the following capabilities to be considered:  Medical Clearance for Respirator Wear -- Every CCRF member who is under consideration to be fit-tested and trained to use an air-purifying respirator must receive medical clearance from a physician or other licensed health care professional employed by the contractor.  Every CCRF member will complete an OSHA Respirator Medical Evaluation Questionnaire.  The medical questionnaire will be completed on line by the CCRF member and submitted electronically to the contractor for review.  The questionnaire will pose questions about current respiratory problems, physical conditions, hypertension, heart disease, musculo-skeletal problems, seizures, or any previous problems that may be encountered when wearing a respirator.  Based on the results of the questionnaire, officers that indicate problems or who answer certain trigger questions may be required to have additional medical tests completed based on the recommendations of the licensed health care professional, such as a pulmonary function test utilizing spirometry.  Spirometry testing, if required, will be provided by the contractor at each of the fit-testing sites.  Officers, who are medically cleared by the contractor, either initially, or after their successful completion of spirometry, will proceed to training and fit- testing.  EDUCATION PROGRAM -- The contractor shall ensure that respiratory program participants are provided information on-line related to risk assessment, disease states to be considered, respirator protection elements, medical clearance, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment including limitations.  Specifically, the training must include a discussion of the OSHA Respirator Standard (29 CFR 1910.134), proper use of respiratory protection devices, limitation(s) of the chosen respirator, donning and fit-checking procedures, and cleaning and/or disposal procedures.  RESPIRATOR SELECTION AND AVAILABILITY - The disposable N-95 Respirator is a particulate respirator or "air-purifying respirator" because it cleans air by filtering particles as you breathe.  These respirators only protect against particles, not gases or vapors.  Airborne biological agents such as bacteria or viruses are particles, and as such, many can be filtered by particulate respirators such as the N-95. The N-95 respirator is the current respirator of choice for protection against tuberculosis.  Additionally, it is believed by the CDC and other public health entities that the N-95 respirator will also provide the appropriate, minimum level of respiratory protection, against SARS for health care workers.  There are many styles of N-95 respirators, and in the experience of knowledgeable environmental health officers, no single style of N-95 will be appropriate for everyone.  A comprehensive, effective, and compliant respiratory protection program requires the availability of appropriate respirators to provide good fit for all participating individuals.  This can only be accomplished through the provision of multiple models and sizes of required respirator types.  Several models and sizes of respirators commonly found to result in successful fit-tests, as well as lesser quantities in appropriate numbers and sizes for alternative respirators will be furnished by the contractor, and shall be available at fit-testing sites to fit-test officers.  SITE IDENTIFICATION - The CCRF will provide the contractor with a list of cities, and will provide appropriate space at Federal facilities for the contractor to provide fit-testing.  Those cities are: Albuquerque, Anchorage, Atlanta, Boston, Butner, NC, Cincinnati, Dallas/Ft Worth, Gallup, NM, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Rockville, MD, Shiprock, NM, Washington, DC.  RESPIRATOR FIT TESTING - The contractor shall provide respirator fit-testing via the quantitative method. Quantitative fit-testing occurs when a negative pressure respirator is placed on a participant and connected to a device which quantitatively determines whether any leakage has occurred.  One such device is a Portacount, which is manufactured by TSI, Inc, and is probably the most commonly used.  All CCRF members who have been medically cleared and have received appropriate education as described above, will be quantitatively fit-tested by the contractor.  After successful fit-testing, CCRF members will be given the respirator with which they were fit tested.  All personnel, equipment, and respirators necessary to complete the medical evaluation, training, fit-testing, and record-keeping shall be furnished by the contractor.  	PROGRAM RECORD KEEPING -- Because the sponsor retains some responsibility for ensuring that deploying officers are properly educated, medically cleared, fit-tested, tested annually, and medically followed over time, there must be an ongoing record keeping program.  The contractor's records associated with medical evaluation, the results of any additional testing, training, fit-testing, and the actual respirator brand, model, and size that is successfully fitted for each officer shall be submitted by the contractor to the CCRF, and maintained by the CCRF. The contractor shall fully observe requirements for medical confidentiality of CCRF members.   However, the Respiratory Protection Program Manager at CCRF will be provided with a copy of all related medical, training, and fit-testing records for each participant.  BULK RESPIRATOR PURCHASE -- The contractor shall supply up to 20,000 respirators to the CCRF which shall correspond in brand, model, and size to those fit-tested for the CCRF membership.  Approximately 2,000 respirators, in representative brands, models, and sizes as mentioned above, will be immediately shipped to CCRF headquarters.  The remainder of the bulk purchase shall be housed at the contractor's warehouse or that of a bonded middleman for immediate overnight express shipment to the site of any deployment that might involve respiratory risk to the officers who deploy.  This option of utilizing the contractor's resources for overnight shipment of respirators must be available.  .

<DESC>This synopsis describes an upcoming solicitation that the FDA plans to issue.  A firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a base year plus two option years is planned.

The purpose of the contract resulting from the solicitation will be to assist the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Drug Safety (ODS) in expanding its access to medical error data resources, to complement our current adverse event databases.
 

This data will be used by FDA staff to better assess a medical error event, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  This effort is a response to the ongoing initiatives identified in the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force Report (QuIC response to the IOM report) dated February 2000.  The QuIC report, in part, charged FDA with the tasks of developing standards associated with proprietary drug name confusion, labeling and packaging to prevent dosing and drug mix-ups and medication errors; and, to strengthen FDA’s overall analytical capabilities.  To assist in performing these initiatives, ODS is interested in acquiring direct access to one centralized data system integrating multiple information systems from either US hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, or other components of health care systems representing potential and actual medical errors.  For the purpose of this requirement, medical errors include, but are not limited to, medication errors, laboratory errors, surgical errors, and/or device errors. 

The FDA intends to use Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data in addition to these data to strengthen our internal safety analysis on medical errors.  This analysis may lead to a regulatory action with a pharmaceutical or device company.  The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of critical issues associated with medical errors is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  The addition of these data would complement and strengthen the utility of the voluntary and mandatory reporting systems currently in place. Access to these data will increase FDA’s capability to perform regulatory impact studies to better understand and improve standards for medical product naming, labeling, packaging, and design.

Program Research Goals: 

Provide direct access to a medical error data resource with the capability of providing root cause and trend analysis.
Provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time.
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to retrieve reports that are driven by certain selection parameters (e.g. health system setting, product name, product specific information [strength, dosage form, etc.] date of error, type and cause of the error, and patient outcome). 
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to query and obtain aggregate reports for the purpose of conducting medical error evaluations.  
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to broadcast global safety messages to the health system users of the medical error database for the purpose of seeking reports for certain adverse events that have been previously identified by FDA (item is desirable but not required).

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a two-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.

The anticipated release date of the solicitation is October 17, 2003.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals in the area of high sensitivity, passive millimeter wave and infrared imaging arrays of microantennas in Focal Plane Array (FPA) structures.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary reductions in the size, weight, and power consumption of FPA millimeter wave imagers.  These will not need RF amplification and should have pixel uniformity equal to conventional approaches. 
 
Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 04-01 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The MIATA program will consist of an 18-month core effort followed by an optional second 18-month period for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition, or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards totaling approximately $20 million over three years are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2004.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site: http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams/Login.asp, has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is C. Martin Stickley, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: mstickley@darpa.mil.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:  The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and subsystem level technology for integration into the tactical environment that provides revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military relative to current modes of operation.  The goals of the program are the identification of areas for potential improved performance and the design of systems and subsystems to validate performance gains.  The program focuses on the development of complete systems or subsystems rather than basic sciences.  Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems.  Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases.  The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept.  Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward technology development.  AREAS OF INTEREST:  DARPA is the central research and development organization for the Department of Defense (DoD).  It manages and directs selected basic and applied research and development projects for DoD, and pursues research and technology where risk and payoff are both very high and where success may provide dramatic advances for traditional military roles and missions.  DARPA/TTO focuses on technologies in the context of platforms and in ways that enable new system and platform functionality, such as autonomous and semiautonomous operations, controls, sensors, weapons, power, and propulsion.  TTO tends not to focus on C3I, microsensors, materials, or basic science.  For specific examples of systems currently under development by TTO, see "Programs" at www.darpa.mil/tto/ as compared to other DARPA Offices listed at www.darpa.mil.  This BAA seeks new ideas, not necessarily extensions of the current programs.  Future TTO priorities fall within four primary focus areas: 1) Space, including: a) Small, low-cost, high-performance satellites, b) Rapid, flexible, low-cost launch, and c) Operations in space; 2) Unmanned Vehicles, including: a) Low-altitude operation - mobility and speed among natural and manmade obstacles, b) Deployment and operation by lower echelons, c) Reduced logistical and human burden, and d) Weapons integration and release; 3) Tactical Multipliers, including: a) New concept ground, air, and sea vehicles, b) Long-range and indirect-fire highly lethal weapons, c) Technologies enabling higher-performance platforms and weapons; 4) Urban Warfare and Low Intensity Operations, including: a) Decisive conflict and stable peacekeeping with no/minimal US casualties, b) Rapid neutralization of combatants with minimal effect on non-combatants, and c) Flexibility to rapidly adjust and compensate for new tactics and responses to US force structure.  Potential future transformational warfighting applications of these priorities might include: 1) Unmanned vehicles, including a) Aerial, b) Ground, c) Water surface, and d) Underwater; 2) Infantry robots; 3) Non-lethal/totally-neutralizing anti-personnel weapons; 4) Boundless urban access with impunity and minimal disruption; 5) Ultra-precision, near-instantaneous, global power projection; 6) Ubiquitous, inescapable, in-situ manipulation and action in urban areas; 7) Rapid, low-cost access to space; 8) Space control; 9) Rapid control, stabilization, and pacification during military operations.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2004 funds.  The Government plans to make $3.0M of FY 2004 funds available in total for all funded efforts, but the total of all awards may be less than or more than that amount.  For Government programmatic flexibility, all offerors should segment their cost proposals as follows: an initial 12-month or shorter effort to explore and validate the concept followed by one or more optional efforts.  The total effort including options should not exceed four years.  Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.  OFFERORS:  Teaming is encouraged.  An offeror may submit more than one proposal.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in innovative tactical technology.  SCHEDULE:  This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals.  The purpose of a white paper is for the offeror to solicit early feedback as to whether the research proposed will be of interest to TTO.  It is thus in the submitter's best interest to articulate clearly the innovative concept and the technology development proposed.  The submission of a white paper is optional, but should be used by the offeror to avoid the expense of proposal generation for ideas that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA.  TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within thirty (30) days after its receipt with a recommendation on the likelihood of selection.  Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated.  Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award.  For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO at the address identified below not later than 1600 local time, 23 Dec 2003.  In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO at the address identified below on or before 1600 local time, 20 Feb 2004.  Proposals received after that date will be reviewed and evaluated in a timely fashion.  White papers received after 1600 local time, 15 Sep 2004, will not be evaluated.  The BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 local time on the closing date, 10 Nov 2004.  Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  As soon as the evaluation of a proposal is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected and the program will be funded, or 2) the proposal has not been selected.  One copy of each non-selected proposal will be retained for the files.  Any additional copies of non-selected proposals will be destroyed upon non-selection.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) Overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach.  2) Potential contribution and relevance to TTO mission by meeting the goals of the BAA.  3) Offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort.  4) Project plan and technology transition plan.  The plan to carry out the work and the plan to accomplish technology transition to use by the military services.  5) Cost realism.  FORMAT OF WHITE PAPERS AND PROPOSALS:  The form and format for white papers and proposals follows.  White papers and proposals that do not satisfy these form and format requirements or with differing content between their electronic and paper versions may be rejected without further review or evaluation.  All submissions should be in the English language.  Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word format and submitted via e-mail or on CD-ROM or Iomega Zip disk.  Submission deadlines apply both to electronic and paper versions.

For the purpose of this determination, the ability to provide an acceptable, credentialed provider within the one-hour time frame and to comply with technical and computer security requirements are considered to be more important than price and past performance combined.  This acquisition is UNRESTRICTED.  The NAICS code is 621512 and the small business standard is 11.5 million.  All responsible business sources may submit quotation, which will be considered.  Solicitation number FA3010-04-T-0002 will be issued electronically on 14 Oct 03 and may be accessed and downloaded at: www.eps.gov .

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is contemplating extending its contract with Florida International University (FIU), Contract No. 524-C-00-99-00011-00, under the sole source authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. This contract was competed under full and open competition and its original purpose will remain unchanged.  The modification will provide a bridging mechanism for the continued provision of highly specialized services in working with the judges and other judicial personnel until the Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) reaches full implementation in the year 2005, and the contract for a new successor project is awarded. 
This modification will also extend the completion date of the contract by 21 months, from January 11, 2004 to October 10, 2005.
The principal objective of this activity is to:1) strengthen the capacity and organization of the judicial sector in carrying out their responsibilities under the Criminal Procedures Code and the Criminal Code; 2) increase public awareness and NGO networking in promotion of access to justice; and 3) support the implementation of merit-based selection, promotion and sanction of judges. Florida International University is uniquely qualified to provide the assistance to be offered under the proposed extension, for the following reasons:  1) FIU is the only entity that has participated fully in the development of the two key pieces of legislation included in the Nicaraguan justice reform, thus it has a unique knowledge of and familiarity with this legislation; 2) FIU has unique experience in having accompanied the justice reform implementation process in Nicaragua thus far, including developing excellent working relationships with colleagues and counterparts in the judicial branch; and 3) extension of the contract with FIU will avoid incurring substantial additional costs and delays that could irreparably damage U.S. Government objectives in Nicaragua. This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance with Numbered Note 22.  Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Insitute (NCI), on behalf of the National Institute of Nerological Disease and Stroke (NINDS), Developmental Neural Plasticity Unit (DNP), intends on entering into a sole source contract with Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY, 10594 for Maintenance services on an existing LSM 510 META system formerly purchased from Carl Zeiss.  The DNP is engaged in the study of fundamental mechanisms that underlie the development and remodeling of neuronal circuits in the mammalian olfactory sytem. The Zeiss LSM 510 META system is an integral part of DNP olfactory system studies to determine the development and formation of its associated neural circuitry.  Many studies of DNP require the use of genetically modified mice that have been engineered to express fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, dsRed) in the olfactory sytem and the focus is on imaging primary afferent as they converge and form synapses onto the olfactory bulbs.  DNP experiements are performed in vivo either in anethetized animals or in acute slice preparations and it is necessary to collect detailed images of the olfactory bulbs repeatedly over time.  In doing so the LSM 510 META system will be used to determine the precise organization of the circuitry that surrounds olfactory bulb glomeruli (the central synaptic structure in theolfactory bulb) and by simultaneously imaging pre- and post synaptic components of specific glomerulus detect any remodeling of that circuitry.  In order for the DNP to continue performing it's sceintific research utilizing the Zeiss 510 META it is essential that this confocal system be maintained in top working order which requires the support of a full service contract.  Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc. is the system manufacturer and the only source known to the NCI/NINDS researchers that can provide such services to the aforementioned system.  The period of performance for this service contract will be for one year.  Personnel that are both technically trained on this specific system and officially certified by the manufacturer are required to perform such repairs to this sensitive equipment, as well as the ability to provide any manufacturer certified parts that may be needed to service the equipment.  All parts must be identical to those currently on the system and compatible to function properly and provide accurate information.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished material must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M., E.S.T. (Local Washington, D.C. time) on November 17, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, 301-402-4509.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being procured based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 811219.  Please include the solicitation number RFQ-NCI-40009-NQ on all correspondence.

<DESC>Market Survey and Request for Information

The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement’s has a requirement to procure ammunition. 
The Department of State is conducting market research for any small business source and or companies that can provide the following ammunition: 5.56 mm Ball, NSN 1305-01-155-5449 Min 12,480 Max 4,000,000, 7.62 mm 4 ball/ Tracer for minigun, NSN 1305-00-926-3942 Min 5,046,000 Max 10,000,000, 9mm ball NSN 1305-01-172-9558 Min 6,240 ea, Max 20,000.  Military specifications must be met and the ammunition must be manufactured in the United States. The delivery location will be to the freight forwarder located in Miami Florida, the awardee will be required to obtain the export license and end user certificate and any other requirement to move the ammunition into Colombia. 
The government is requesting that industry identify their capabilities of the businesses that may be interested in this effort. The anticipated method of procurement will be to utilize a fixed price IDIQ (Base year plus four one year options) and award to the technically acceptable low price contractor. Please identify potential problem areas, and provide recommendations for industry standards. The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing possible cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with this requirement. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to identify capable firms.

It is the Government’s intention to make ONE award.  All interested business concerns shall identify their interest by providing the company name, capabilities, mailing address, phone number, and electronic mail address to the contracting office. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals. The use of information received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the government. Any subsequent solicitations will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The government will not critique a potential offeror’s information and the RFI should not be used by offerors to market their services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited. Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. 

Submit responses no later than 17 November  2003, via email. 

Internet and e-mail capabilities are a must!  

Point(s) of contact. Reply to Lisa C. Goodwine, please reply to goodwinelc@state.gov.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>R -- Access to Health Systems Medical Error Data
<SOLNBR>223-04-5502
<CONTACT>Katharine Minker, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7155, Fax (301) 827-7151, Email kminker@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>This synopsis describes an upcoming solicitation that the FDA plans to issue.  A firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a base year plus two option years is planned.

The purpose of the contract resulting from the solicitation will be to assist the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Drug Safety (ODS) in expanding its access to medical error data resources, to complement our current adverse event databases.
 

This data will be used by FDA staff to better assess a medical error event, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  This effort is a response to the ongoing initiatives identified in the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force Report (QuIC response to the IOM report) dated February 2000.  The QuIC report, in part, charged FDA with the tasks of developing standards associated with proprietary drug name confusion, labeling and packaging to prevent dosing and drug mix-ups and medication errors; and, to strengthen FDA’s overall analytical capabilities.  To assist in performing these initiatives, ODS is interested in acquiring direct access to one centralized data system integrating multiple information systems from either US hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, or other components of health care systems representing potential and actual medical errors.  For the purpose of this requirement, medical errors include, but are not limited to, medication errors, laboratory errors, surgical errors, and/or device errors. 

The FDA intends to use Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data in addition to these data to strengthen our internal safety analysis on medical errors.  This analysis may lead to a regulatory action with a pharmaceutical or device company.  The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of critical issues associated with medical errors is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  The addition of these data would complement and strengthen the utility of the voluntary and mandatory reporting systems currently in place. Access to these data will increase FDA’s capability to perform regulatory impact studies to better understand and improve standards for medical product naming, labeling, packaging, and design.

Program Research Goals: 

Provide direct access to a medical error data resource with the capability of providing root cause and trend analysis.
Provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time.
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to retrieve reports that are driven by certain selection parameters (e.g. health system setting, product name, product specific information [strength, dosage form, etc.] date of error, type and cause of the error, and patient outcome). 
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to query and obtain aggregate reports for the purpose of conducting medical error evaluations.  
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to broadcast global safety messages to the health system users of the medical error database for the purpose of seeking reports for certain adverse events that have been previously identified by FDA (item is desirable but not required).

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a two-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.

The anticipated release date of the solicitation is the week of October 27, 2003.  Please do not call or email at this time. No further information regarding this requirement will be provided until after the solicitation is released.

 SOLICITATION NUMBER: 263-04-007 
 ISSUANCE DATE:  November 10, 2003
 CLOSING DATE/TIME:  4:30 pm Cairo time on December 13, 2003
 POSITION TITLE: Human Resources Supervisor
 MARKET VALUE:  GS-13 ($61,251-$79,629)
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  2 years only
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/ Cairo, Egypt 
 SECURITY ACCESS:  SECRET
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens
  
 POSITION DESCRIPTION
 
I.	Introduction: 
             
               Organizational Location of Position: The position requires residence in Cairo, Egypt. Cairo (pop. approx. 16 million) is the largest city in Africa and Middle East. Although suffering from many urban problems (e.g. severe pollution, and traffic congestion), Cairo is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites and most sports. The Red Sea and the Mediterranean, easily reachable for weekend trips, provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba.
          
              USAID/ Egypt Program : USAID/ Egypt manages the largest and one of the most diverse bilateral assistance program in USAID, with Fiscal Year [FY] 2004 operating year budget of $575 million and a pipeline of approximately $1.4 billion. The Mission, with 47 U.S. Direct Hire (USDH), 21 U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC), and approximately 240 Foreign Service National (FSN) employees, manages approximately 130 major contracts and grants. The program is highly visible and, consequently, attracts intense State Department interest, Embassy oversight and Congressional scrutiny. USAID/ Egypt is implementing assistance programs across its Strategic Objectives (SOs). 
 	 
	The Mission employs a vast range of mechanisms in implementing activities to achieve these SOs, including cash transfer policy reform programs, infrastructure construction, endowments, a commodity import program and a significant local currency program, in addition to traditional technical assistance and grants.

              The USAID/ Egypt Mission also supports the US-Egyptian Partnership for Economic Growth and Development. The Partnership provides an additional dimension of complexity to program management because of the imperative to balance long-term foreign assistance objectives with more immediate priorities articulated by the Office of the Vice President and a wide range of other US government departments/ agencies participating in the Partnership. The Mission is currently restructuring its portfolio to accommodate the planned reduction in the program budget over the next couple of years and a newly- approved Country Strategy that is designed to support Egypt’s efforts to compete successfully in the global economy.

II.		Basic Functions

The HR Supervisor is responsible for planning, developing, and implementing a full range of American and Foreign National personnel services to support the USAID Egypt program.  Personnel management services will also be provided to other USAID Missions as requested, where USAID Egypt has been designated to provide regional support.   Services provided and overseen include position classification, recruitment, hiring and termination, as well as oversight of mission systems for evaluation, counseling, and training.  The HR Supervisor advises mission management on personnel policies and issues, and serves as the primary Mission point of contact with the Embassy on matters pertaining to post-specific regulations and guidelines affecting American and host country employees.  The HR Supervisor administers the Mission awards, employment, and training programs, and ensures Mission compliance with all legal, regulatory, procedural and policy requirements governing personnel management activities.

<DESC>Reference the previous modification no.02: The presolicitation notice is further modified to read as follows: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 617-04-001 to implement follow-on 44-month Strengthening Decentralization in Uganda II (SDU II) activity. Local governments in Uganda, though in place and functioning, cannot fully perform all the responsibilities and duties devolved to them.  This situation is further complicated by disconnects between the various planning and budgeting processes, as well as the lack of a strong interface between local governments and various elements of the community. Local governments lack capacity to forge sectoral commitments for economic growth and social services, to respond to new allocation formulas under the Fiscal Decentralization System for resource flows to the districts, and to join stakeholders to a political process for effective planning and budgeting. Increasing local revenue generation to meet rising local government staff and services needs involves a parallel challenge to Local governments to engage communities and key tax and fee payers. And, with rising opportunity for corruption in their ranks, local government must adapt to a new set of harmonized regulations for local procurement and to organize the work of Local Tender Boards so as to assure public transparency. Success in addressing these problems will make local governments trusted agents in the redistribution of Central Government transfers, as well as locally generated revenue. USAID has already invested greatly in establishing a strategic framework and creating the enabling processes to support decentralization.  We now move into a critical period in which lessons learned must be applied to the broad base of local government across the country. USAID has identified a select set of critical areas for active engagement which include: planning and budgeting for fiscal decentralization, local procurement processes (including anti corruption), local revenue generation and  support of key USAID sectoral priorities at the local level, specifically HIV/AIDS, Health and Education,  and 2. enabling activities that strengthen community and Community Based  Organization (CBO) linkages with local government, provide effective tools for management, capacity building and service delivery and ultimately contribute to expansion of  the democratic base of local governance.

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon availability of appropriated FY2004 funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. The anticipated date for issuance of the RFP is changed to November 21, 2003.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 12 and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is the only notification or solicitation that will be made.  Interested offerors are requested to read the instructions herein.  An updated RFQ was previously released with an updated SOW, and questions/answers from potential offerors.  The following additional information is provided:  1)  The Government will not be evaluating travel expenses and will provide a travel budget at contract award, because approval is still pending to conduct this study at the specified BEP vendor facilities  2) The LOE was provided so that offerors would be able to provide a proposal given that there are some significant uncertainties at this point as regards survey of vendor facilities; it is possible to propose alternatives such as a fly-in, fly-out approach for certain key personnel, and to have alternatives to performance on-site if this is the offeror's approach; however, the offeror should be prepared to support frequent meetings at the BEP in the event that off-site performance is proposed.  However, payment of per diem over the entire length of the project would be unaffordable to the BEP and we would need identification in the proposal that the vendor had the capability to perform the project primarily using locally-based personnel.    3)  Due to potential changes in the handling of U.S. mail and overnight mail packages at the BEP on or near the time of receipt of proposals, the following proposal handling procedures are required: To insure timely handling of your proposal, you are requested to forward your proposal by overnight mail not later than two days prior to the due date (also, if you mail on a Friday or Saturday, you need to specify Monday delivery, since this proposal is due Monday, Nov 17th).  To insure that this office is aware that you submitted a proposal and that it is considered timely (in case your proposal hard copy is delayed), you are requested to submit an e-mail with a cover letter and pricing spreadsheet attached to the e-mail, concurrent with your hard copy being separately sent by overnight mail.  In the event that your proposal does not arrive in hard copy on November 17th, you will be contacted individually to submit your entire proposal via e-mail attachment, after the proposal due date, as a follow-up to this e-mail, and to fax evidence that you had previously submitted a hard-copy package via overnight mail.  DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR ENTIRE PROPOSAL VIA E-MAIL ATTACHMENT UNLESS REQUESTED TO DO SO BY THE BEP, BECAUSE THIS WILL OVERLOAD OUR VERY LIMITED E-MAIL MAILBOX STORAGE CAPACITY.  DO NOT FAX YOUR ENTIRE PROPOSAL TO THE BEP.  DO NOT PLAN TO HAND-CARRY YOUR PROPOSAL TO THE BEP.  This is not an opportunity for extra time to submit a proposal.  We expect to see evidence that something was actually mailed to us before the due date in time for receipt.  Your patience in the above and adherence to these procedures will insure that if your proposal was submitted on a timely basis, it will be counted as having been submitted on a timely basis.  Point of contact is George Robertson, 202-874-3255, e-mail: george.robertson@bep.treas.gov.

              USAID/ Egypt Program : USAID/ Egypt manages the largest and one of the most diverse bilateral assistance program in USAID, with Fiscal Year [FY] 2004 operating year budget of $575 million and a pipeline of approximately $1.4 billion. The Mission, with 47 U.S. Direct Hire (USDH), 21 U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC), and approximately 240 Foreign Service National (FSN) employees, manages approximately 130 major contracts and grants. The program is highly visible and, consequently, attracts intense State Department interest, Embassy oversight and Congressional scrutiny. USAID/ Egypt is implementing assistance programs across its Strategic Objectives (SOs). 
 	 
	The Mission employs a vast range of mechanisms in implementing activities to achieve these SOs, including cash transfer policy reform programs, infrastructure construction, endowments, a commodity import program and a significant local currency program, in addition to traditional technical assistance and grants.

              The USAID/ Egypt Mission also supports the US-Egyptian Partnership for Economic Growth and Development. The Partnership provides an additional dimension of complexity to program management because of the imperative to balance long-term foreign assistance objectives with more immediate priorities articulated by the Office of the Vice President and a wide range of other US government departments/ agencies participating in the Partnership. The Mission is currently restructuring its portfolio to accommodate the planned reduction in the program budget over the next couple of years and a newly- approved Country Strategy that is designed to support Egypt’s efforts to compete successfully in the global economy.

<DESC>Statement of Work:
The Prepositioned Equipment Program

1.  Introduction.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  These tasks UNDER THIS sow are the logical extension of the Prepositioned Emergency Response Equipment Study and are intended to continue execution and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for First Responders on behalf of Wackenhut Services Inc.

2.  Background.  In the FY 2001 Appropriations Bill for Justice, the Joint Conference report indicated that the Appropriations Committee was aware of unfunded requirements for equipping State and local emergency first responders to deal with a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorist incident.  The Committee directed the creation of a Federal prepositioned equipment program to sustain State and local first responders.

To develop the concept for an effective prepositioned equipment program for emergency first responders, the Department of Justice Office for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support (since renamed the Office for Domestic Preparedness and transferred to the Department of Homeland Security) formed a study team and an advisory working group comprising select senior emergency responder subject matter experts from major metropolitan areas across the country.  Five sub-groups, Command and Control, Equipment, Logistics, Medical, and Federal Partners, each led by an experienced member of the emergency response community, focused on key aspects of the concept.  Sub-panels prepared draft concepts for defining the PEP program within their functional area of responsibility.  The study team integrated the findings and recommendations of the sub-panels to provide an integrated baseline approach for the program.  This effort resulted in the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress. 

The Report to Congress constituted Phase I in the development of the PEP program for the First Responders.  Subsequent Phases focus on the implementation and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP).

3.	Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  

4.	Objectives and Scope.  This SOW has the following objectives: 1) to provide administrative support to sustain the PEP program, 2) to develop, implement and sustain the information technology support required to support the program.   In addition, office space for the Wackenhut Program Coordinator and Facility Manager will be provided by the successful bidder. 

5.	Accomplishments.  Two pivotal accomplishments guide this project:

·	the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress, and,

·	the WMD Prepositioned Program (PEP) Operations Manual has been written and is awaiting publication by the Department of Homeland Security.

6.   Methodology.  Provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP program through the integration with other complimentary activities and closely coordinate with key interagency participants in the national approach to the WMD terrorist threat.   

7.  Subtasks.  This SOW consists of four tasks.  Specific tasks are as follows:

Subtask 1 – DEVELOP PLANS AND STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs) FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEP

Develop, as directed by WSI, plans and procedures that will ensure the timely and efficient implementation of the PEP program and will continually refine these plans and procedures as experience with the program identifies improved operational methods.

Potential products include the review / update of plans and SOPs.
 
Subtask 3 – PROVIDE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT FOR THE PEP STORAGE SITES NATIONWIDE. 

	Coordinate the required hardware, software 
and  internet connections to maximize the efficient operation of the various storage sites.  This task will also involve the development, and maintenance of a PEP web site.  Functions shall include:

survey 	each site to determine the most cost effective approach to implement a local area network and to connect the site to the internet;

coordinate the installation of telephone and high speed internet connectivity through the WSI, General Services Administration telephone point of contact;

<DESC>NIMA has a sole source requirement for the Computer to Plate (CTP) System, which requires the purchase, installation and integration of upgrades to existing production equipment.  The requirements list the purchase, installation and configuration of 2 - 108 gigabyte hard drives for the Creo Renaissance 2000 Scanners, which is an upgrade that is required for the scanning of large format repromat. Current disk capacity on the scanners prohibits large format production.  The other requirements include the purchase, installation, integration and configuration of 2 Black Diamond 6800 Management Switch Fabric Module 3 boards, 2 Black Diamond 220VAC Power Supplies, 2 Black Diamond 32-Port Switch Module 100Base-FX MMF MTRJ, and 3 Black Diamond 12-Port Switch Module 1000Base-SX MTRJ. These boards and modules are for installation into the Computer to Plate Extreme Black Diamond Network Switch located at our Arnold, MO facility.   NIMA currently has a maintenance agreement with a contractor that has been a support contractor for the past seven years and the Computer to Plate Prime Maintenance Contractor for the last three years.  Their company has done all of the installation and integration and systems support during this time and has an intimate working knowledge of the Computer to Plate system and how it interacts with other vital NIMA operations.  This acquisition was justified as a sole source procurement, and therefore, NIMA does not desire this synopsis to be used for competition purposes, it is only intended for those interested in possible subcontracting opportunities.
