<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-05:  Battlefield Helicopter Emulator (BHE) Program.

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contracts Management Office, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA, 22203-1714

DESCRIPTION: The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative proposals for the Battlefield Helicopter Emulator (BHE) program. The focus of the program will be development of innovative acoustic and infrared emulation technologies that can be integrated onto a surrogate, small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. In addition to this BAA, and before submitting proposals, prospective Offerors must refer to the BHE Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA web site, http://www.darpa.mil/baa for further information. The BHE PIP contains additional details regarding the program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal information.  This Announcement, together with the PIP, constitutes BAA 07-05.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the first round of selections.  In order to be considered during the initial round, full proposals must be received no later than 12:00 pm (noon) EST on March 15, 2007.

OVERALL PROGRAM GOAL AND VISION: The goal of the BHE program is to develop small scale technologies that can effectively emulate the acoustic and infrared signatures of a wide variety of helicopters, from small scout to large utility helicopters.  The technologies developed in the program will be integrated onto a surrogate, small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to produce a low cost, expendable battlefield decoy.  This capability would aid in special operations, provide anti-helicopter mine location and engagement, and draw fire from enemy ground locations. 

DARPA may fund one or more contractor teams for Phase I.  This phase will involve development and demonstration of scaleable technologies to emulate the acoustic and infrared signature of helicopters.  At the end of Phase 1, this system must be demonstrated at a Government specified test range and under Government specified evaluation criteria. Offerors are directed to the PIP for further information.  The Offeror is expected to provide a realistic technical and cost proposal for best achieving the program objectives. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and fund portions of proposals if warranted.

The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. Offerors are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Sec. 217 and PL 105-261 Sec. 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified Offeror is encouraged to respond.

AWARD INSTRUMENT AND EVALUATION APPROACH:  This BAA affords Offerors the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, and other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation. 

The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.  

Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated against the following criteria, in descending order of importance: 1) Technical Approach, 2) Management Approach, 3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission, 4) Relevant Experience in Developing Military Systems, and 5) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  Since no common work statement exists, each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit as it relates to the program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.  Intellectual property restrictions on the objective system may be viewed unfavorably to the extent that they affect the Government's ability to transition the system. 

SUBMISSION INFORMATION: All proposals shall be submitted to the Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS) Proposal Submission System.  In addition, Offerors must submit Two (2) paper copies of the full proposal, accompanied by a transmittal letter signed by an official who is authorized to commit the Offeror.  Responses shall be submitted as detailed in the PIP.

All material submitted through T-FIMS must be UNCLASSIFIED.  Offerors that intend to include classified, or potentially classified information or data as part of their proposals shall submit an UNCLASSIFIED PROPOSAL referring to a classified annex.  Content of proposal submissions made through T-FIMS must be UNCLASSIFIED.

Web site http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/ provides information regarding the T-FIMS system and web site https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa/proposer_instructions.pdf contains guidance for proposal submission. Organizations must register at: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa to submit a proposal. Only the lead or prime organization should register. One registration per proposal should be submitted. Organizations wishing to submit multiple proposals should complete a single registration for each proposal.  By registering, the Offeror has made no commitment to submit. 

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All Offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through either: 1) an active DARPA contract or subcontract; or 2) an active contract or subcontract administered on DARPA's behalf by another Government agent. All affirmations must state which office(s) the Offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposed submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the Offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the Offeror shall so state in the affirmation. 

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT: The Government intends to use support contractors, plus other independent experts to assist in processing and administering proposals, and to provide advice relative to specific technical areas. These personnel are restricted by their contract from disclosing information contained in any proposal for any purpose to anyone outside of the Source Selection for this effort.

<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, â€œOnly One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirementsâ€, the Department of Energy (DOE) is planning to issue a sole-source contract to enable DOE to obtain assistance from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) in support of the Departmentâ€™s efforts to improve the operational safety and cleanup activities of its nuclear facilities. DOE intends to award a five-year follow-on contract to INPO. The contract will include a twelve-month base period and four twelve-month option periods. INPO possesses unique experience and expertise derived from their close working relationship with all U.S. utilities in the areas of operations, maintenance, radiation preparedness, technical support, engineering, training and emergency preparedness. The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations is the arm to the U.S. industry that either directly develops or coordinates the development of continuing operational safety improvements made at the U.S. nuclear plants. INPO is the only known organization to provide the services required by the Department to all commercial nuclear reactor firms and owns all rights to their proprietary documents and software. It is deemed appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. Only one responsible source is available and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Department.

<SUBJECT>D -- Renewed NATO NOI to Issue an Invitation for Bids under International Competitive Bidding for Extension of the SHAPE Bi-SC AIS Core to NU Network and Hardware/Software Upgrade of Bi-SC AIS for SHAPE
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-11910-BISC-AIS
<RESPDATE>030107

<DESC>In March 2006, The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) issued a Notification of Intent (NOI) to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) under an International Competitive Bidding (ICB) competition for IFB-CO-11910-BISC-SHAPE. The renewed NOI posted today reflects an increase in the scope of the requirement and the fact of combining two infrastructure projects within the Bi-SC area in one IFB. 

The IFB extension is changed herein from BISC-SHAPE to BISC-AIS. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11910-BISC-AIS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. 

The Bidders List compiled from the Declarations of Eligibility (DOEs) provided already to NC3A in response to the original NOI is herein re-opened to enable for the addition of any other eligible bidders and/or deletion of existing bidders. Unless instructed otherwise, NC3A will keep on the Bidders List all the bidders for which a DOE was provided in response to the original NOI.
 
The estimated value of this project is Euro 13.0 million (USD $16.8 million). Contractor selection will be based on the lowest compliant bid (one envelope procedure). All bids submitted in response to this IFB shall show the minimum validity of 12 months from the bid closing date.

Only companies from participating NATO nations are eligible to engage in this competitive bidding process. In addition, all contractors, sub-contractors and manufacturers, at any tier, must be from participating countries. None of the work, including project design, labor and services shall be performed other than by firms from and within participating countries.

The IFB package shall not contain material of a classified nature. Prospective bidders, however, should be aware that contractor personnel may be called upon to work at a NATO site in connection with the contract and that such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET inclusive. All such personnel clearances must be in place prior to the contract award. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO security clearance certifications. 

SCOPE OF PROJECT

1) Extend the SHAPE Bi-SC AIS Core to the NU Network (Project 2001/5IS03024)

Within the Bi-Strategic Commands Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS), there is a need to provide cost effective, secure, interoperable, survivable and robust NATO Unclassified (NU) Public Access Local Area Network (PA LAN) capabilities between Allied Command Operations (ACO) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and ensure interoperability with National Information Systems, which are connected to the Internet. These capabilities will be implemented for the different NATO commands by multiple NATO Host Nations. This contract will need to deliver PA LAN facilities at SHAPE and NCSA (NATO CIS Services Agency) Headquarters in Mons, Belgium, and will run in parallel with other Host Nation contracts, which will deliver PA LAN facilities in the commands in their nations.

The main purpose of this project is to ensure that the SHAPE - NCSA PA LAN is standardized and upgraded to be compliant with PA LANs throughout the Bi-SC AIS, and thus create a consistent baseline in the NU domain space. The main project objective will be to extend the Bi-SC Core Capability to the PA domains.

The PA LAN will be based on standard COTS equipment.

This project will provide SHAPE and NCSA:

- Computers, Laptops and Peripheral Equipment
- Networking Hardware, including switches, racks, local cable and wiring
- Servers to support Firewall, DBMS, DMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage and Infrastructure Services
- OEM versions of Operating System Software
- Hard/software to support security service requirements 
- Replacement of any substandard hardware
- Contract Support to install the system and, where required, do the system transition work required
- Migration of Data on workstations and servers

The contractor will provide an integrated system solution, utilizing as much as possible the existing infrastructure, procuring all additional necessary hardware, software, components, cables and connectors, and install, configure, test and achieve acceptance by NATO.

This project will ensure that any existing or new client or server will be migrated to Windows XP/Windows 2003 or a later version.

The contractor will install, integrate and test all equipment and configure all components based on the NATO Bi-SC AIS Configuration Baseline.
 
The contractor will be asked to provide comprehensive management and logistic support. This would include, but may not be limited to, providing spare parts, warranty, periodic and emergency maintenance, technical documentation, as well as training.

2) Hardware and Software Upgrade of Bi-SC AIS for SHAPE (Project 2001/5IS03036)

Within the Bi-SC AIS, there is a need to provide cost effective, secure, interoperable, survivable and robust NATO Secret Local Area Network capabilities between ACO and ACT and ensure interoperability. These capabilities will be implemented for the different NATO commands by multiple NATO Host Nations. This contract will need to deliver NS facilities at SHAPE and NCSA Headquarters in Mons, Belgium, and will run in parallel with other Host Nation contracts, which will deliver NS facilities in the commands in their nations.

The main purpose of the project is to ensure that the SHAPE - NCSA NS LAN is standardized and upgraded throughout the Bi-SC AIS. The main project objective will be to maintain the NS services by upgrading older system components.

The NS LAN will be based on standard COTS equipment.

This project will provide SHAPE and NCSA:

- Computers, Laptops and Peripheral Equipment
- Networking Hardware, including switches, racks
- Servers to support DBMS, DMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage and infrastructure services
- OEM versions of Operating System Software
- Hard/software to support security service requirements 
- Replacement of any substandard hardware
- Contract support to install the system and, where required, do the system transition work required
- Migration of data on workstations and servers

The contractor will provide an integrated system solution, utilizing as much as possible the existing infrastructure, procuring all additional necessary hardware, software, components, cables and connectors, and install, configure, test and achieve acceptance by NATO.

This project will ensure that any existing or new client or server will be migrated to Windows XP/Windows 2003 or a later version.

The contractor will install, integrate and test all equipment and configure all components based on the NATO Bi-SC AIS Configuration Baseline.
 
The Contractor will be asked to provide comprehensive management and integrated logistic support. This would include, but may not be limited to, providing spare parts, warranty, periodic and emergency maintenance, technical documentation, as well as training.

The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued.

<DESC>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to contract with AMERICAN SCIENCE & ENGINEERING (AS&E), Billerica, MA. for one (1) Z Portal X-ray, w/ Backscatter, Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) imaging system to support Counter-Drug and Anti-Terrorism Programs. The system will be used primarily for inspecting passenger cars.  This contract will include the system, installation and training to support the deployment with an expected 12-month period of performance.

The AS&E Z-Portal system has state-of-the-art capabilities that assist CBP officers in the detection of contraband and weapons of mass destruction materials.  This system uses standard transmission X-ray technology along with a unique "Backscatter", capability which detects low Z (density) objects such as explosives, organics, plastics, etc. that are not normally seen through a transmission X-ray imaging system . The backscatter capability, in comparison to standard Gamma-ray and X-ray transmission NII technology intended for high density objects, gives a much clearer image of the low density objects hidden in car fenders, tires, trunks, gas tanks and under the hood.  

In addition, the system offers Forwardscatter technology to complement this AS&E patented Z Backscatter technology.  Forwardscatter presents a second scatter perspective that displays dense regions of scanned vehicles and compliments the Z-Portal units capabilities.   Forwardscatter X-ray images are produced by photons, which are both attenuated while passing through the cargo, and scattered at small angles from the primary beam. Metallic and high-density objects appear dark in the image since they absorb most X-rays.  This is similar to transmission imaging but the Forwardscatter detectors are set off the beam plane axis to improve field of view and therefore do not require precise alignment as transmission x-ray detectors would.  

The system will be used primarily at border crossings that have a high volume of car traffic.  In addition, this system has a radiation detection capability to alert the operators of the presence of radioactive materials within a container.     

Because of the positive results of previously acquired and deployed Mobile Z Backscater Vans, (CBP) would like to implement this system, which is based on similar technology, into its operational environment for secondary inspections and also to serve as an evaluation instrument.    

Therefore, since AS&E is the only manufacture that can provide a system with traditional x-ray imaging and patented "Z Backscatter" and Forwardscatter technology for this requirement.  CBP intends to procure this system on a sole source basis directly from AS&E. 

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  No telephone inquiries, please.

<DESC>NDBC STANDARD SPECIFICATION FOR PROCUREMENT OF ACOUSTIC RELEASE 


1.0	SCOPE

1.1	PURPOSE

This specification contains the requirements for procuring an Acoustic Release including the compatibility requirement that the release must operate with the deck sets that are currently used for communicating with existing releases.  These releases are presently used extensively for the DART program and will soon be used in a developing ocean measurement program.
 
1.2	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

Any ambiguity or conflict between this specification and other applicable documents shall be resolved by the following order of precedence:

a)	The issued contract with any amendments or modifications
b)	This specification
c)	Other applicable documents


2.0	REQUIREMENTS

2.1	GENERAL

The acoustic release requirements and deck set compatibility requirements are covered separately below.  In order to preserve operational flexibility it is critical that the acoustic release and deck set are 100% compatible with each other and with existing NDBC inventory.

2.2	ACOUSTIC RELEASE

2.2.1	MECHANICAL

The entire acoustic release shall be comprised of single pressure housing with no external cables.  The pressure housing shall act as the in-line load bearing member with a minimum working load of 10,000 lbs.  The release shall not self-release under loading until at least 12,000 lbs of force are applied.   The depth rating of the pressure vessel shall be at a minimum 6000m.  The overall length of the instrument shall not exceed 40? and shall not weigh more than 65 lbs in salt water.  Preference will be given to a design that allows easy maintenance and battery exchange.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) on behalf of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Office Interagency Medical Services (OIMS) has a requirement to procure an integrated health care system to augment the services provided through State and local detention facilities.  


The Office of Interagency Medical Services (OIMS) works to assure that the health care provided to the USMS prisoners housed within 95 USMS District Offices and approximately 200 District Sub-offices is consistent with established Prisoner Health Care Standards (PHCS) guidelines described in USMS Publication Number 100 (http://www.usmarshals.gov/prisoner/standards.htm). OIMS supports the USMS mission by arranging the most clinically appropriate and cost effective health care services with goals focusing on cost, quality, and accessibility to health care services provided outside of the detention facility.  On average, the USMS spends approximately $52 million per year for medical services delivered to prisoners by community medical care providers outside the walls of detention facilities, of which $22.5 million is subject to re-pricing of medical claims.  Additionally, the USMS spends approximately $9 million a year on prescriptions drugs.


The OFDT intends to award a fixed-price type contract.  The contract will have a potential term of 10 years consisting of one four-year base period and two three-year option periods.     Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work.    
The OFDT anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about November 14, 2006 with an estimated response date of January 8, 2007.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the OFDT.  

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for December 5, 2006 from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm Eastern Standard Time.  The address is:  1750 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, 22202
All parties will assemble in the lobby area of the Crystal Square 3 Building.  All individuals must pre-register for this conference.  Due to security reasons, there will be no walk-ins allowed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Acoustic Center of Excellence (ACoE) at Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) is planning for a full & open competition for  limited purchase of Acoustic Hailing Device (AHD) in support of Joint Non- Lethal Weapon Directorate (JNLWD).  In spring of 2006, a market survey for  commercial-off-the-system (COTS) AHD was conducted and a down-select through a  performance validation& evaluation identified three products; LRAD, PSAIR and  SC for a limited military utility assessment (LMUA).   As a result of the LMUA and joint Army and Navy operational requirements, an  urgent need has been identified for a modified COTS AHD specifically for  tactical wheeled vehicle and small boat applications.  The modified COTS AHD  mounted on vehicle and/or small boat should project a directional hailing and  warning command intelligibly at distances greater than 300m with background  noises (~80 dBa) in an open area.  The size, weight, power requirements as well  as the platform integration will be evaluated as consideration factors.   Additionally the modified COTS AHD must meet Mil-STD-810.    The full & open competition will commence on or about 15 Feb 07 which would  include a RFP inviting those three product venders identified for the 2006  LMUA.  All other vendors with COTS product(s) that can be improved to meet the  aforementioned requirements are also welcome to participate.  However the  vendorâ€™s proposal must include field test data showing acceptable performance  of their current COTS products in order to be considered.  The submitted field  test data must be certified by a government agency or Penn State  University/Applied Research Laboratory.  Proposal requirements will be detailed  in the RFP.               The purpose of the RFP is to select an offerer to perform and deliver 4ea AHD  with operators and maintenance manuals that are best meeting the aforementioned  requirements.  The offerer will be required to conduct performance test(s),  with Government witness, to validate the agreed product performance as part of  the final acceptance.  The overall effort will be covered by a FFP contract  with final deliverables due 6 months from the award date of contract.     This is not a Request for Proposal; the estimated solicitation issue date is  only an estimate. The point of contact for this action is Courtney-Lynn Barnes, Contract  Specialist, AMSML-AQ-AJ, email: courtney.barnes2@us.army.mil.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT INTERESTED PARTIES PM SKOT requests information prior to release of any resultant solicitation.  The information within this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date.  This information is subject to ch ange and is not binding upon the Government.  Updated information will be provided in a subsequent notice or synopsis, if and when necessary.   PM SKOT wishes to identify POTENTIAL SOURCES that are capable of providing containers that can store heavy duty construction equipment such as 40+ lb pavement breakers, concrete saws, chain saws, grinders&.etc, as well as miscellaneous items that support a  new system.  The shipping constraints of air transportation and the Primary Mover (M1084 5ton truck) limit the container dimensions.  Our intent is to package our tools in a container so that we do not protrude above the top of the cab, keeping transport issues to a minimum.  Also, to protect the equipment from outer elements (heat, rain, water, sand&etc.) while stowed.  Reference: "	M1084 Tech Crane Specs  See attached Crane document. The containers must meet the following specifications: "	Height requirements: o	Max height = 52 "	Length and Width requirements:  o	Area #1: Dimensions- 55 length x 74 wide (Used to secure heavy duty construction tools and equipment; boxes #1 and #2).  These tools and equipment will be powered by electric, hydraulic, diesel, and gasoline.  Proper HAZMAT venting will be required for  the container that houses the gas powered equipment.   o	Area #2: Dimensions- 31 length x 74 wide (Used to secure heavy duty construction tools and equipment; boxes #3 and #4). o	Area #3: Dimensions- 62 length x 19 wide (Used to secure miscellaneous non-HAZMAT equipment) o	Area#4:  Dimensions- 8 length x 74 wide (Used as extra cargo space)  o	These numbers are rough estimates and are not firm; they may fluctuate but only by inches. "	The containers must be composed of plastic or composite type material.  Metallic boxes will not suffice. "	Containers must be organized to house equipment (shelves, compartments&.etc). "	Due to crane limitations, containers must not weigh more than 5000 lbs (including equipment) at end of truck bed and no more than 3500 lbs (including equipment) at 10 ft from end of truck bed. "	Must be four way forkliftable and able to be picked up by sling load.  Should have recesses or bracket mounts to secure tie down straps. "	Must be shippable and capable of being secured and/or locked. "	Must be resistant to outer elements (heat, rain, wind, water, ice, sand&etc.) "	Containers must align with back 8 horizontal tie-down points for secure stowage. Responses must include the weight of the containers, as well as the maximum weight the containers can hold. Attachments for Tool Loads requirements, Crane Specs and Cab Space can be found at https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/SOWandSPECS/index.htm. NOTE: No solicitation is issued at this time.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of various products developed by AdLib Software which make up their PDF/A conversion suite.  This software is required in order to convert native format documents into the PDF/A standard for storage in the official Department of State archive.  The chose of this document format (PDF/A) has been approved by NARA.  This purchase includes a subscription service that includes software fixes, technical support, and new product updates.  The Adlib Software PDF/A application software will be used as an automated conversation tool to convert 300+ different file formats into the approved open standard PDF archive format.  This conversion will allow access to archival documents far into the future and is also approved by NARA (National Archives Records Administration). A search of the internet and technical documents was done to obtain a list of venders that produced enterprise server based products to fulfill this requirement.  This list was narrowed down to three different products.  These products were brought in-house and evaluated. It was determined during this evaluation that the AdLib Software product was the best fit to our requirements for a number of reasons. •	IT-CCB - As SMART moves to deployment all the products that make up the core will have to go through and be approved by the IT-CCB/IA and DS processes by limiting the number of new unknown applications this process will be smoother and quicker to accomplish. •	Ease of use - One of the goals of the evaluation was to find a product that met our requirements and also was easy to install, configure and use. •	Scalability – Currently licensing of the product allows us to add additional conversion servers as we need to meet processing demands without having to purchase additional licenses. •	Cost – This product came in closest to the initial estimates we set aside for the PDF/A solution within SMART.<BR><BR>

FHWA's Highways for LIFE (HfL) is a discretionary program of SAFETEA-LU, funded at $75 million over four years, to demonstrate and promote state-of-the-art technologies, elevated performance standards, and new business practices in the highway construction process that result in improved safety, quality and user satisfaction, faster construction, and reduced congestion from construction work zones.  The purpose is to accelerate the rate of adoption of proven innovations and technologies. The purpose of the Technology Partnership Program is to work with the highway construction industry to accelerate the adoption of promising innovations.  Innovations is an inclusive term used by HfL to convey all of the following, but not limited to:  technologies, materials, tools, equipment, procedures, specifications, methodologies, processes, or practices used in the financing, design, or construction of roads or highways.

<SUBJECT>B--HYDROCHEMICAL MODELING OF GROUND WATER CHEMICAL ANALYSES
<SOLNBR>07CR08-NOSOLICITATION
<RESPDATE>021407
<ARCHDATE>01302008
<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT  3032369327     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Yucca Mountain Project Branch (USGS-YMPB) has a requirement for hydrochemical modeling of ground-water chemical analyses from the Yucca Mountain region. During the past 10 years, the USGS-YMPB has conducted hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of ground water from wells and springs in the Yucca Mountain area of southern Nevada.  These data, and historical data, have been compiled into a comprehensive hydrochemical-isotope data base for delineation of hydrochemical facies and for evaluation of potential mixing among these facies.  Because of the unevenly spaced sampling points and different types of samples (discrete or open bore), conventional approaches to spatial analysis and point-by-point modeling may not fully extract all of the potential information contained in this data set.  Consequently, the USGS-YMPB requires a statistical approach to evaluate the hydrochemical/isotope variability of the data.  In this approach, even "mixed" samples from open bores are valuable information.  The approach developed by Geopoint AB through the support of the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal company (SKB), and used internationally by several nuclear waste programs, offers the possibility of obtaining information about downgradient mixing and dispersion of the potential contaminant plume from the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.  Results of this innovative modeling will increase our knowledge about the potential long-term release of radionuclides to the environment.The Swedish hydrochemical code M3 (Multivariate Mixing and Mass Balance) as described by Laaksoharu, M., Skårman, C., and Skårman, E., 1999, Multivariate mixing and mass balance (M3) calculations, a new tool for decoding hydrogeochemical information:  Applied Geochemistry, v. 14, p. 861-872) will be used to evaluate the degree and extent of mixing and dispersion of different ground-water domains at and downgradient from the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will provide an extensive hydrochemical and isotopic data base (EXCEL format) as the basis for this modeling.  The modeling will be conducted using three subsets of the regional data set:  (1) Yucca Mountain and upgradient recharge areas, (2) Yucca Mountain and down gradient to Highway 95 where analyses of samples form Nye County Early Warning drilling program can be included, and (3) Highway 95 and Amargosa Desert.  Depending on results, a fourth effort modeling that will entail all of these areas together may be conducted. Study will be completed in twelve (12) months from time of award.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Geopoint AB, Fridshyddev 15, Sweden , and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required equipment are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. POC:  Diana Romero, U. S. Geological Survey, P. O.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is not a Request for Proposal.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. 

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g. 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that may be qualified to provide specified fee-for service health insurance benefit administration services including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare program (also known as the Medicare fee-for services, or FSS program in accordance with the attached “Draft” Statement of Work (S.O.W.) entitled, “Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor Statement of Work.”  

As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS will replace its current claims payment contractors – fiscal intermediaries and carriers – with new contract entities called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs).  As a result of MMA, CMS designed new MAC jurisdictions to balance the allocation of workloads, promote competition, account for integration of claims processing activities, and mitigate the risk to the Medicare program during the transition to the new contractors.  This sources sought notice is targeted for jurisdiction 4 (includes the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), jurisdiction 5 (includes the states of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska), and jurisdiction 12 (includes the states of Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania).  Additional Medicare Contract Reform information can be located on the CMS Medicare Contract Reform website: 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareContractingReform/ .  
 
Interested parties having the corporate capability and expertise necessary to perform the stated requirements outlined in the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) may submit capability statements via email to Darrell.Bachman@cms.hhs.gov and Linda.Hook@cms.hhs.gov.  Capability statements must demonstrate experience and expertise pertaining to the requirements stated in the SOW and shall be limited to 20 pages.  Responses should also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 524114: Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers.

Responses must be submitted not later than August 16, 2006 by 5:00pm EDT.  Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.  All communications shall be by email.  Only responses from small businesses (e.g. 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) will be considered.  This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No reimbursement will be made for costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and follow-up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of the capability statements. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether small business firms possess the capability to fulfill the Governments requirement.

A1.	No.  All of the information required for purposes of submission of a proposal is contained in the combined synopsis/solicitation.

Q2.	The RFP requests that a spare be provided for the satellite modem ODUs.  Is there a desire to purchase spare Xicom BUCs as well?  
A2.	No.

Q3.	The RFP requests the ODU and rack mount kit to take no more than 6U of space.  Is the rack that accepts the ODU and rack mount kit GFE?  
A3.	Yes.

Q4.	It seems as though the depth available is 20?.  Is this the desired maximum dimension for the ODU (standard rack width x 6U x 20?).  Please confirm.  
A4.	The depth of the rack is 20".  The ODU and any additional cables cannot exceed this depth.  

Q5.	Are there front and rear rails available in the GFE rack?

A6.	As stated in the specification, the ODU must be able to accept 110VAC and 24VDC.

Q7.	Please clarify the characteristics of the DC battery backup.  Is the requirement that accommodation for a battery be provided inside the ODU?  
A7.	No, the battery does not have to be internal, but the ODU must have an interface to have an external battery integrated into the overall system.  Mounting/Connecting the battery must be already designed into the ODU design.

Q8.	Please confirm that the battery backup only needs to support the system while in operation and not while performing satellite acquisition.  There is a significant difference in power requirement between these two scenarios.  
A8.	Battery backup needs to backup the entire system, while in operation AND while performing satellite acquisition.

Q9.	The statement "The Embedded Processor will provide the necessary interfaces and processing capability for the required GUI software." leads one to believe that the Embedded Processor will be a central point for all Monitor and Control  Functions. Is this the desire? 
A9.	Yes.


Q10.	Is there a requirement for the M&C capabilities to be accessed through the Ethernet interface, through the one RS-232 port, and/or are all M&C functions to be performed through each individual components serial interface? Please clarify the desired M&C requirements.

Q11.	Is the user interface to the embedded processor to be via a web interface? 
A11.	Yes.

Q12.	Is the contractor required to provide a laptop to access these features or is this item GFE? 
A12.	GFE.

Q13.	Please clarify the reference to a container.  Is this the GFE rack unit that is accommodating the ODU?
A13.	The container is the ODU.

Q14.	Please provide details regarding the interface panel.  Is this GFE?
A14.	The panel will be manufactured in-house by the Government.  

Q15.	What are the interfaces on the interface panel?  Where is this panel mounted?
A15.	The panel is mounted on the rear of the vehicle.  The interfaces should be the same that's on the AVL 1278K interface panel, which will need to be modified to meet the requirements.  The bidder will provide the required connector info and drawings to the Government to build.

Q16.	The TFOCA II connector is provided in 4 channel and 12 channel versions.  Which of these two versions are required?
A16.	4 channel.  

Q17.	Are we to provide the fiber optic cable and connectors as well?  If so, what length of cable is required?
A17.	No.

Q18.	We assume the power cable will interconnect the ODU to a GFE power source.  Please define the connection type and characteristic of the power source.
A18.	Standard 20A plug.  

Q19.	Are we to provide a hybrid cable that can interconnect to an AC power source and a DC power source?  If so, what connections would be used for these power sources?

However, the delivery schedule specifies an initial shipment of one (1) system and spares 14 weeks ADC and subsequent shipments of two (2) systems and spares each week thereafter.  Given these parameters, will training be required on a weekly basis for each set of systems and spares delivered, or will the Government take a more practical and cost effective approach and schedule training at extended (monthly, bi-monthly, etc.) intervals or in one (1) session upon completion of system and spares deliveries?
A21.	Training will be required when the first sytem is delivered.  Note that acceptance testing will take place with each system.

<SUBJECT>99 -- VSS Announcement
<DESC>The USPTO Office of Procurement awards and administers a wide variety of contracts and simplified purchases for the acquisition of goods and services in support of the Agency?s mission.  To expand the USPTO?s Electronic Commerce capabilities, the Office of Procurement will implement the Vendor Self Service (VSS) system in FY2007.  VSS will facilitate electronic communication and commerce between the USPTO and potential vendors.  At this time vendors may register to participate in future USPTO VSS procurements.  

VSS registrations are being accepted in anticipation of implementation in FY2007.  Upon implementation, VSS will be used to conduct simplified acquisitions only.  While USPTO will continue to post requirements in FEDBIZOPPS, only registered VSS vendors will be able to view simplified acquisition solicitations posted on the VSS website, submit quotes electronically, and receive e-mail notifications of award.  Furthermore, USPTO has a policy that when a solicitation is published in VSS, vendors must be registered and respond in VSS in order to be considered for award.  Additionally, vendor responses using any other medium will not be considered.  

In order to register in VSS, go to the USPTO?s Official Web-site at http://www.uspto.gov/, use the site map to access the Office of Procurement Web Page, and follow the links to Vendor Self Service for further guidance.

The requirement is to purchase an 8-Channel HD Wrist Coil to be used at the U.S. Air Force Academy Hospital MRI Dept.  The coil is to be used with an existing GE MRI scanner and is manufactured specifically for GE by Invivo Corp.  The purchase of the coil through GE Healthcare will allow the item to become part of the GE Service Contract (warranty) currently in place for the MRI, thereby securing no-cost maintenance.

Because of the warranty requirement, GE Healthcare is considered the only source that can satisfy the government?s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334510 and the size standard is <500.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

b.   Any company that feels they have items that meet the needs of the Government and can comply with the GE warranty conditions must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>A -- AUTONOMOUS REAL-TIME GROUND UBIQUITOUS SURVEILLANCE- IMAGING SYSTEM (ARGUS-IS)
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Information Exploitation Office (IXO), announces a Briefing to Industry (BTI) associated with the intended release of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 07-23, the Autonomous Real- time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) Program.  The purpose of the BTI is to outline the ARGUS-IS Program technical goals and problems to potential Proposers.  All presented materials will be made available via Internet when the BAA 07-23 is published, along with a FAQ including all questions and answers.

The BTI is scheduled for 8 February 2007, and will be held in Arlington, VA, from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM.  Because the location for the BTI has limited seating capacity, it is desired that organizations restrict representation to two attendees.  Detailed information about the BTI may be found at: https://www.schafertmd.com/argus/.  A no-cost, pre-registration for the BAA 07-23 BTI is required.  A list of attendees, including name, organization, phone number, and (optionally) specific teaming interest will be posted at that URL.  The deadline for the BTI pre-registration is 6 February 2007.  The full BAA 07-23 solicitation is anticipated to be released on or about 2 February 2007 through FedBizOpps.  Attendance is not required to propose to the BAA 07-23. Similarly, attendance will have no direct bearing on proposal evaluations.

The objective of the ARGUS-IS program is to develop a system that provides a real-time, high-resolution, wide area video persistent surveillance capability and transition this capability to the military.  The ARGUS-IS program is seeking to provide an expanding range of capabilities enabling wide area persistent surveillance.  ARGUS-IS is composed of three major technology components/subsystems, a Gigapixel Sensor Subsystem, an Airborne Processing Subsystem and a Ground Processing Subsystem.  The ARGUS-IS Airborne Subsystem is formed by integrating the Gigapixel Sensor and Airborne Processing Subsystems together.  The packaging of the airborne subsystems should be compatible with a variety of UAS including Extended Range/Multiple Purpose (ER/MP), Aerostat, and A-160 (Hummingbird).  The ARGUS-IS system will be tested and evaluated during a series of flight experiments utilizing a surrogate UAV.  It is expected that a 200 megabit per second data link will be utilized for these flight experiments. 

Interested parties to this notice are cautioned that nothing herein obligates the Government to issue a future solicitation.  Additionally, the Government will no provide cost reimbursement for attendance to the ARGUS-IS BTI.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services/items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Refer to Request for Quotation FA4814-07-T-DP01.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.  NAICS Code is 924110 for administration of air and water resource and solid waste management programs.  This project consists of matching funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as long as MacDill AFB partners with the local non-profit organization Tampa BayWatch.  This is a requirement for shoreline stabilization consisting of construction of a shallow wave energy barrier.  Requirement:  Provide all research and engineering management, labor, materials, equipment and transportation to install a shallow wave energy dissipation barrier approximately 800 ft long parallel to the shoreline.  The barrier shall be constrtucted between 50-150 feet offshore where the water is typically 1.5 to 2.0 feet deep at high tide.  All work shall be in compliance with the statement of work. 1.0  OBJECTIVE: The southeastern shoreline along MacDill AFB is rapidly eroding. The rate of erosion has been estimated to be approximately one foot per year. Shoreline erosion may be due to a number of factors including an increase in the size and volume of commercial ship traffic through Hillsborough and Tampa Bays.  Shoreline erosion has been observed at many locations throughout coastal areas around Tampa Bay.  Due to the steady shoreline erosion at MacDill, approximately 3,800 square feet of beach along a half mile of remnant coastal shoreline is lost annually.  Natural resources along the shoreline have begun to be impacted including the lose of mature coastal vegetation such as historic Live Oaks, mature Black Mangroves, and dense shore grass stands.  The loss of this vegetation represents a substantial loss of coastal habitat areas important to protected avian species and other wildlife.  In addition to the natural resource losses resulting from the disappearing shoreline, an eligible cultural resources site has been impacted by the continuing shoreline erosion.  The Gadsden Point site (MacDill Site 8 Hi50) is located in the northern portion of the southeastern shoreline area.  Erosion of the shoreline in the area around the Gadsden Point site resulted in the discovery of Native American remains around 1994.  Completion of the Phase I shoreline stabilization project in 2004 appears to have sabilized the erosion at the Gadsden Point site. Stabilization of the MacDill AFB southeastern shoreline is being completed through construction of oyster reefs which form a shallow wave-energy barrier approximately 100 feet off-shore where the water is 1.5 to 2.0 feet deep at high tide.  The materials used to create the substructure for the oyster reef include pre-fabricated concrete oyster domes and oyster shell bags (constructed on site using fossilized oyster shell).  The pre-fabricated oyster domes are designed to reduce wave energy and encourage establishment of oyster and mussel beds/bars.  The oyster shell bags also encourage oyster and mussel colonization but do not provide as much vertical relief as the oyster domes.  To date, MacDill AFB has completed three phases of shoreline stabilization work along MacDill sourtheastern shoreline.  A demonstration project (Phase I), completed in 2004, was used to determine which configuration of oyster domes was most effective at reducing wave energy and stabilizing the shoreline.  MacDill AFB received matching funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the previous phases of the shoreline stabilization project.  The FY07 work effort may also receive a matching grant from USFWS.  MacDill AFB has also begun receiving funding through grants from other outside organizations including the Tampa Bay Estuary Programand the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County.   2.0  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:  2.1   The contractor shall provide all management, partial labor, equipment and material to install a shallow wave-energy dissipation barriers demonstration project.  Much of the labor for installation will come from volunteer support by base personnel.  The project shall create a shallow wave-energy dissipation barrier approximately 800 feet long parallel to the shoreline.  The barrier shall be constructed between 50-150 feet off-shore where the water is typically 1.5 to 2.0 feet deep at high tide. 2.2  Permits:  The contractor shall prepare the applications for any permits required for implementation of the project, both State of Florida and federal permits.  2.3  Work Plan:  The contractor shall develop a work plan describing the type of shallow wave-energy dissipation barrier to be used, the proposed method(s) of installing the barriers, and the method(s) for securing the barriers to the substrate.  2.4  Pre-installation Conference:  The contractor shall attend a pre-installation conference to discuss the project, base access, security requirements, etc.  3.0   DELIVERABLES:  3.1  Permits:  The contractor shall submit completed permit applications to 6 CES/CEV for signature as the owner/operator.  3.2   Work Plan:  The contractor shall submit a work plan describing the type of shallow wave-energy dissipation barrier to be used, the proposed method of installation, and the proposed method(s) for securing the dissipation barriers to the substrate. 3.3  Schedule: Permit Application(s);	90d from notice to proceed; para 2.2; 3copies.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued separately.  The solicitation number is FA5000-07-T-0002. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated FAR provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14 and Class Deviation 2005-o0001. The DFARS provisions and clauses are those in effect to DCN 20070122.  The NAICS code 336999, Size standard: 500 employees.  The contractor shall furnish the following supplies and quantities and deliver them to Elmendorf AFB, FOB destination on or before 1 July 2007.  Line item 0001; QTY 9 sets SIB broom cores (part# SIB/MB 2X92805)  The intended source of this requirement is Myslik, Inc., as this is the only authorized dealer of SIB Broom cores in North America.  The SIB core comes with nylon inserts designed to absorb all the wear that the extrusions have incurred with replacement cost being a fraction of that expense.  Nylon insert replacement is now required and is available on the new SIB core which has a five year warranty.  In order to maintain the 5-year warranty for these cores, SIB cassettes must be used with these cores.  Use of other brands would void the warranty and cause excessive wear to the core.  Prior to 2005, broom cassettes were solicitated as ?brand name or equal? but because of the damage sustained to the runway sweepers, it has been determined that brand name is in the best interest of the government.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), within USAID, is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in responding to international crises and disasters.  To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica, Bangkok, Thailand, Dakar, Senegal, Nairobi, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa.  The sub-regional office is in Kathmandu, Nepal.    

The West and North Africa Regional Office (WNARO) in Dakar, Senegal covers 24 countries in West and North Africa.  The region is largely comprised of poor, food insecure nations, and politically unstable and failing states with diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.    

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor in its West and North Africa Regional Office in Dakar, Senegal to ensure that OFDA's objectives for strategic analysis, coordination of disaster response activities, monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded activities, and identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region are effectively met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The contractor will actively oversee disaster response activities, and develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the knowledge and capability of Mission Disaster Relief Officers, host governments, international organizations (IOs), and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to and prepare for disasters in the affected region.  As such, t his position requires the individual to do extensive travel throughout the region, approximately one half of his/her time.  Sometimes the travel must occur on very short notice, to countries outside of the West & North Africa Region, or for extended periods.  In addition, this position requires general professional proficiency [equivalent to Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level 3, or higher] in speaking and writing the French language, in order to work effectively in francophone countries in the region.

The Regional Advisor will be responsible for the following:

Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and minimal supervision of the Principal Regional Advisor, the contractor will:
* Travel to the scene of disasters or potential disasters and conduct initial assessments of damage and needs; determine appropriate U.S. Government (USG) relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor;
* Coordinate and maintain close liaison with senior representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;
* Monitor OFDA-funded activities in coordination with the DOS in Washington; 
* Validate OFDA relief supply requests in consultation with OFDA/Washington and coordinate receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of supplies;
* Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of  DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs;
* Liaise, as needed, with U.S. military personnel to ensure a coordinated and efficient disaster response and/or implementation of humanitarian assistance projects;
* Prepare field information and reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.

Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the contractor will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.
Specifically, the contractor will:
* Prepare regular strategic and analytical reporting cables on conditions of current unfolding or developing emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;
* Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, humanitarian organizations, and other donors as appropriate;
* Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA efforts including the review of sector disaster response and plans;
* Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the West and North Africa Regional Office and OFDA/Washington.  Support may include assessment visits, project design and evaluation exercises, and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
* Coordinate with other agencies and organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing them;
* Work with senior representatives of local and regional institutions and private and public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor for West Africa.  However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.  


SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have latitude to exercise independent judgment. The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to negotiate non competitively with BAE Systems Inc., 2525 Network Place, Herdon, Virginia 20171.  The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) of the Library of Congress administers a free library service to eligible residents of the United States and citzens living abroad who cannot hold, handle, or read traditional print media because of visual or physical handicaps.  NLS is now in the process of transitioning from an analog system to a digital system for distributing audio books and magazines to its libraries.  Plans for this transition are in Current Strategic Business Plan for the Implementation of Digital System, December 2003. The core of this new system is the Digital Talking Book (DTB). In 2009, NLS anticipates the creation of "duplicate on demand" centers which would be tow or more special off site facilities that can take requests for a particular title from a remote library, download it from web site, and then "duplicate" a number of these titles on to flash memory cartridges for the library that requested it.  NLS presently makes use of an in-house design, legacy, computer system called the Production Information Control System (PICS). This computer system has been in use since 1992, and was developed specifically to facilitate the management of information associatd with the production f all book and magazine materials produced by NLS for it patrons.  This system is essential to the proper and efficient operation of NLS production, and presently is configured for the present analog production environment.  In order to support the new totally digital environment, NLS anticipates it will need to modify its PICS software to acommodate the purely digital production of DTB's and to work in a totally digital production environment.  NLS engaged in an analysis and design of the modifications to the PICS system in order for the PICS system to work in this enviroment. This analysis was performed at the end of the 2006 by BAE Systems Inc. under contract LCNLS060129.  The procurement deals with the work necesary to take this high level design and implement these modifications, with the sole exception of the new copy allotment process, which will be implemented as a separate task.

The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and price.  The following technical factors will be evaluated and are listed in descending order of importance:
 
(1)  Technical Approach 
(2)	 Past Experience/Performance.     

Technical Approach:     
Technical proposal shall be no longer than 6 typed pages (12pt font), excluding pictures, illustrations,  drawings, and copy of AvL quote.  It must include a detailed description of the product and all of its capabilities.  It must include an overview of similar systems and some of the customers using them.  It must include pictures of the system, single line drawings, and similar systems.  A copy of Avl’s quote (price may be deleted) is required to ensure all of the features of the special NAVAIR version are being provided.   It must describe your knowledge and understanding of the technical requirements and identify the methodology and analytical techniques you will use to manage the work and ensure that all SOW requirements are met.  Offers will be evaluated on the demonstrated ability to provide a technical approach that integrates the tasking into a cohesive effort that can be accomplished with minimal risk.   

Required Past Experience/Performance Documentation:
The offeror shall provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks as required by this SOW and at least two (2) years of experience producing similar products within the past three (3) years.  If the offeror will subcontract any significant part of this effort, the offeror must provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks for those subcontractors.  The offeror shall provide applicable contractor names, contract numbers, contract dollar values, description of product provided, and periods of performance.  Each narrative shall also include the name, area code and phone number, mailing and e-mail address of the person from each identified contractor who can verify the offerors past experience/ performance.  The Past Experience/Performance Documentation shall be no longer than 3 typed pages (12pt font).  The Government will conduct reference checks on performance, customer satisfaction with respect to technical quality of product provided, ability to meet contractual schedules, management responsiveness, and cost control.  The Government will also evaluate the relevance of the offeror's past experience/performance compared to the requirements specified in the SOW.  The Government may supplement the information you provide with performance information it may obtain from any other reliable source including its own experience with your firm (or Subcontractor).  Offerors unable to fully demonstrate they have successfully completed two (2) similar tasks to this SOW in the past three (3) years will be considered to be a higher risk to the Government and as a result may not be considered for award.	

The technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, to the extent that the offers become more equal in the technical and past performance factors, then price takes on added significance.

ATTACHMENT 3
INTERAGENCY LANGUAGE ROUNDTABLE LANGUAGE SKILL LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS

SPEAKING:
Speaking 0 (No Proficiency)
Unable to function in the spoken language. Oral production is limited to occasional isolated words. Has essentially no communicative ability. 

Speaking 0+ (Memorized Proficiency)
Able to satisfy immediate needs using rehearsed utterances. Shows little real autonomy of expression, flexibility or spontaneity. Can ask questions or make statements with reasonable accuracy only with memorized utterances or formulae. Attempts at creating speech are usually unsuccessful.

Examples:  The individual's vocabulary is usually limited to areas of immediate survival needs. Most utterances are telegraphic; that is, functors (linking words, markers and the like) are omitted, confused or distorted. An individual can usually differentiate most significant sounds when produced in isolation but, when combined in words or groups of words, errors may be frequent. Even with repetition, communication is severely limited even with people used to dealing with foreigners. Stress, intonation, tone, etc. are usually quite faulty. 

Speaking 1 (Elementary Proficiency)
Able to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics. A native speaker must often use slowed speech, repetition, paraphrase, or a combination of these to be understood by this individual. Similarly, the native speaker must strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even simple statements/questions from this individual. This speaker has a functional, but limited proficiency. Misunderstandings are frequent, but the individual is able to ask for help and to verify comprehension of native speech in face-to-face interaction. The individual is unable to produce continuous discourse except with rehearsed material.

Examples:  Structural accuracy is likely to be random or severely limited. Time concepts are vague. Vocabulary is inaccurate, and its range is very narrow. The individual often speaks with great difficulty. By repeating, such speakers can make themselves understood to native speakers who are in regular contact with foreigners but there is little precision in the information conveyed. Needs, experience or training may vary greatly from individual to individual; for example, speakers at this level may have encountered quite different vocabulary areas. However, the individual can typically satisfy predictable, simple, personal and accommodation needs; can generally meet courtesy, introduction, and identification requirements; exchange greetings; elicit and provide, for example, predictable and skeletal biographical information. He/she might give information about business hours; explain routine procedures in a limited way and state in a simple manner what actions will be taken. He/she is able to formulate some questions even in languages with complicated question constructions. Almost every utterance may be characterized by structural errors and errors in basic grammatical relations. Vocabulary is extremely limited and characteristically does not include modifiers. Pronunciation, stress, and intonation are generally poor, often heavily influenced by another language. Use of structure and vocabulary is highly imprecise. 

Speaking 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus)
Can initiate and maintain predictable face-to-face conversations and satisfy limited social demands. He/she may, however, have little understanding of the social conventions of conversation. The interlocutor is generally required to strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even some simple spe member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  

If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical 
access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  

(Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

ISSUANCE DATE: January 30, 2007
CLOSING DATE: March 2, 2007, 5:00 p.m. EST 

SUBJECT:  This Amendment is to provide Attachments 1 and 2 to the Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Regional Advisor in the West and North Africa Regional Office in Dakar, Senegal.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section 

(i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  

The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible familyech. The speaker at this level may hesitate and may have to change subjects due to lack of language resources. Range and control of the language are limited. Speech largely consists of a series of short, discrete utterances.

Examples:  The individual is able to satisfy most travel and accommodation needs and a limited range of social demands beyond exchange of skeletal biographic information. Speaking ability may extend beyond immediate survival needs. Accuracy in basic grammatical relations is evident, although not consistent. May exhibit the more common forms of verb tenses, for example, but may make frequent errors in formation and selection. While some structures are established, errors occur in more complex patterns. The individual typically cannot sustain coherent structures in longer utterances or unfamiliar situations. Ability to describe and give precise information is limited. Person, space and time references are often used incorrectly. Pronunciation is understandable to natives used to dealing with foreigners. Can combine most significant sounds with reasonable comprehensibility, but has difficulty in producing certain sounds in certain positions or in certain combinations. Speech will usually be labored. Frequently has to repeat utterances to be understood by the general public. 

Speaking 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) 
Able to satisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements. Can handle routine work-related interactions that are limited in scope. In more complex and sophisticated work-related tasks, language usage generally disturbs the native speaker. Can handle with confidence, but not with facility, most normal, high-frequency social conversational situations including extensive, but casual conversations about current events, as well as work, family, and autobiographical information. The individual can get the gist of most everyday conversations but has some difficulty understanding native speakers in situations that require specialized or sophisticated knowledge. The individual's utterances are minimally cohesive. Linguistic structure is usually not very elaborate and not thoroughly controlled; errors are frequent. Vocabulary use is appropriate for high-frequency utterances, but unusual or imprecise elsewhere.

Examples:  While these interactions will vary widely from individual to individual, the individual can typically ask and answer predictable questions in the workplace and give straightforward instructions to subordinates. Additionally, the individual can participate in personal and accommodation-type interactions with elaboration and facility; that is, can give and understand complicated, detailed, and extensive directions and make non-routine changes in travel and accommodation arrangements. 

Simple structures and basic grammatical relations are typically controlled; however, there are areas of weakness. In the commonly taught languages, these may be simple markings such as plurals, articles, linking words, and negatives or more complex structures such as tense/aspect usage, case morphology, passive constructions, word order, and embedding. 

Speaking 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)
Able to satisfy most work requirements with language usage that is often, but not always, acceptable and effective. The individual shows considerable ability to communicate effectively on topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows a high degree of fluency and ease of speech, yet when under tension or pressure, the ability to use the language effectively may deteriorate. Comprehension of normal native speech is typically nearly complete. The individual may miss cultural and local references and may require a native speaker to adjust to his/her limitations in some ways. Native speakers often perceive the individual's speech to contain awkward or inaccurate phrasing of ideas, mistaken time, space and person references, or to be in some way inappropriate, if not strictly incorrect.

Examples:  Typically the individual can participate in most social, formal, and informal interactions, but limitations either in range of contexts, types of tasks or level of accuracy hinder effectiveness. The individual may be ill at ease with the use of the language either in social interaction or in speaking at length in professional contexts. He/she is generally strong in either structural precision or vocabulary, but not in both. Weakness or unevenness in one of the foregoing, or in pronunciation, occasionally results in miscommunication. Normally controls, but cannot always easily produce general vocabulary. Discourse is often incohesive. 

Speaking 3 (General Professional Proficiency)
Able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations in practical, social and professional topics. Nevertheless, the individual's limitations generally restrict the professional contexts of language use to matters of shared knowledge and/or international convention. Discourse is cohesive. The individual uses the language acceptably, but with some noticeable imperfections; yet, errors virtually never interfere with understanding and rarely disturb the native speaker. The individual can effectively combine structure and vocabulary to convey his/her meaning accurately. The individual speaks readily and fills pauses suitably. In face-to-face conversation with natives speaking the standard dialect at a normal rate of speech, comprehension is quite complete. Although cultural references, proverbs and the implications of nuances and idiom may not be fully understood, the individual can easily repair the conversation. Pronunciation may be obviously foreign. Individual sounds are accurate: but stress, intonation and pitch control may be faulty.

Examples:  Can typically discuss particular interests and special fields of competence with reasonable ease. Can use the language as part of normal professional duties such as answering objections, clarifying points, justifying decisions, understanding the essence of challenges, stating and defending policy, conducting meetings, delivering briefings, or other extended and elaborate informative monologues. Can reliably elicit information and informed opinion from native speakers. Structural inaccuracy is rarely the major cause of misunderstanding. Use of structural devices is flexible and elaborate. Without searching for words or phrases, the individual uses the language clearly and relatively naturally to elaborate concepts freely and make ideas easily understandable to native speakers. Errors occur in low-frequency and highly complex structures. 

Speaking 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Is often able to use the language to satisfy professional needs in a wide range of sophisticated and demanding tasks.

Examples:  Despite obvious strengths, may exhibit some hesitancy, uncertainty, effort or errors which limit the range of language-use tasks that can be reliably performed. Typically there is particular strength in fluency and one or more, but not all, of the following: breadth of lexicon, including low- and medium-frequency items, especially socio-linguistic/cultural references and nuances of close synonyms; structural precision, with sophisticated features that are readily, accurately and appropriately controlled (such as complex modification and embedding in Indo-European languages); discourse competence in a wide range of contexts and tasks, often matching a native speaker's strategic and organizational abilities and expectations. Occasional patterned errors occur in low frequency and highly-complex structures. 

Speaking 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)
Able to use the language fluently and accurately on all levels normally pertinent to professional needs. The individual's language usage and ability to function are fully successful. Organizes discourse well, using appropriate rhetorical speech 
devices, native cultural references and understanding. Language ability only rarely hinders him/her in performing any task requiring language; yet, the individual would seldom be perceived as a native. Speaks effortlessly and smoothly and is able to use the language with a high degree of effectiveness, reliability and precision for all representational purposes within the range of personal and professional experience and scope of responsibilities. Can serve as in informal interpreter in a range of unpredictable circumstances. Can perform extensive, sophisticated language tasks, encompassing most matters of interest to well-educated native speakers, including tasks which do not bear directly on a professional specialty.

Examples:  Can discuss in detail concepts which are fundamentally different from those of the target culture and make those concepts clear and accessible to the native speaker. Similarly, the individual can understand the details and ramifications of concepts that are culturally or conceptually different from his/her own. Can set the tone of interpersonal official, semi-official and non-professional verbal exchanges with a representative range of native speakers (in a range of varied audiences, purposes, tasks and settings). Can play an effective role among native speakers in such contexts as conferences, lectures and debates on matters of disagreement. Can advocate a position at length, both formally and in chance encounters, using sophisticated verbal strategies. Understands and reliably produces shifts of both subject matter and tone. Can understand native speakers of the standard and other major dialects in essentially any face-to-face interaction. 

Speaking 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Speaking proficiency is regularly superior in all respects, usually equivalent to that of a well educated, highly articulate native speaker. Language ability does not impede the performance of any language-use task. However, the individual would not necessarily be perceived as culturally native.

Examples:  The individual organizes discourse well, employing functional rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Effectively applies a native speaker's social and circumstantial knowledge; however, cannot sustain that performance under all circumstances. While the individual has a wide range and control of structure, an occasional nonnative slip may occur. The individual has a sophisticated control of vocabulary and phrasing that is rarely imprecise, yet there are occasional weaknesses in idioms, colloquialisms, pronunciation, and cultural reference or there may be an occasional failure to interact in a totally native manner. 

Speaking 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency)
Speaking proficiency is functionally equivalent to that of a highly articulate well-educated native speaker and reflects the cultural standards of the country where the language is natively spoken. The individual uses the language with complete flexibility and intuition, so that speech on all levels is fully accepted by well-educated native speakers in all of its features, including breadth of vocabulary and idiom, colloquialisms and pertinent cultural references. Pronunciation is typically consistent with that of well-educated native speakers of a non-stigmatized dialect. 


WRITING:
Writing 0 (No Proficiency)
No functional writing ability. 

Writing 0+ (Memorized Proficiency)
Writes using memorized material and set expressions. Can produce symbols in an alphabetic or syllabic writing system or 50 of the most common characters. Can write numbers and dates, own name, nationality, address, etc., such as on a hotel registration form. Otherwise, ability to write is limited to simple lists of common items such as a few short sentences. Spelling and even representation of symbols (letters, syllables, and characters) may be incorrect. 

Writing 1 (Elementary Proficiency)
Has sufficient control of the writing system to meet limited practical needs. Can create by writing statements and questions on topics very familiar to him/her within the scope of his/her very limited language experience. Writing vocabulary is inadequate to express anything but elementary needs; writes in simple sentences making continual errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation but writing can be read and understood by a native reader used to dealing with foreigners attempting to write his/her language. Writing tends to be a loose collection of sentences (or fragments) on a given topic and provides little evidence of conscious organization. While topics which are "very familiar" and elementary needs vary considerably from individual to individual, any person at this level should be able to write simple phone messages, excuses, notes to service people and simple notes to friends. 

Writing 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus)
Sufficient control of writing system to meet most survival needs and limited social demands. Can create sentences and short paragraphs related to most survival needs (food, lodging, transportation, immediate surroundings and situations) and limited social demands. Can express fairly accurate present and future time. Can produce some past verb forms but not always accurately or with correct usage. Can relate personal history, discuss topics such as daily life, preferences and very familiar material. Shows good control of elementary vocabulary and some control of basic syntactic patterns but major errors still occur when expressing more complex thoughts. Dictionary usage may still yield incorrect vocabulary or terms, although the individual can use a dictionary to advantage to express simple ideas. Generally cannot use basic cohesive elements of discourse to advantage (such as relative constructions, object pronouns, connectors, etc.). Can take notes in some detail on familiar topics, and respond to personal questions using elementary vocabulary and common structures. Can write simple letters, summaries of biographical data and work experience with fair accuracy. Writing, though faulty, is comprehensible to native speakers used to dealing with foreigners. 

Writing 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) 
Able to write routine social correspondence and prepare documentary materials required for most limited work requirements. Has writing vocabulary sufficient to express himself/herself simply with some circumlocutions. Can write simply about a very limited number of current events or daily situations. Still makes common errors in spelling and punctuation, but shows some control of the most common formats and punctuation conventions. Good control of morphology of language (in inflected languages) and of the most frequently used syntactic structures. Elementary constructions are usually handled quite accurately and writing is understandable to a native reader not used to reading the writing of foreigners. Uses a limited number of cohesive devices. 

Writing 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)
Shows ability to write with some precision and in some detail about most common topics. Can write about concrete topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows surprising fluency and ease of expression but under time constraints and pressure language may be inaccurate and/or incomprehensible. Generally strong in either grammar or vocabulary but not in both. Weaknesses or unevenness in one of the foregoing or in spelling result in occasional miscommunication. Areas of weakness range from simple constructions such as plurals, articles, prepositions and negatives to more complex structures such as tense usage, passive constructions, word order and relative clauses. Normally controls general vocabulary with some misuse of everyday vocabulary evident. Shows a limited ability to use circumlocutions Uses dictionary to advantage to supply unknown words. Can take fairly accurate notes on material presented orally and handle with fair accuracy most social correspondence. Writing is understandable to native speakers not used to dealing with foreigners' attempts to write the language, though style is still obviously foreign. 

Writing 3 (General Professional Proficiency)
Able to use the language effectively in most formal and informal written exchanges on practical, social and professional topics. Can write reports, summaries, and short library research papers on current events, on particular areas of interest or on special fields with reasonable ease. Control of structure, spelling and general vocabulary is adequate to convey his/her message accurately but style may be obviously foreign. Errors virtually never interfere with comprehension and rarely disturb the native reader. Punctuation generally controlled. Employs a full range of structures. Control of grammar good with only sporadic errors in basic structures, occasional errors in the most complex frequent structures and somewhat more frequent errors in low frequency complex structures. Consistent control of compound and complex sentences. Relationship of ideas is consistently clear. 

Writing 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Able to write the language in a few prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Not always able to tailor language to suit audience. Weaknesses may be in poor control of low frequency complex structures, vocabulary or the ability to express subtleties, and nuances. May be able to write on some topics pertinent to professional/educational needs. Organization may suffer due to lack of variety in organizational patterns or in variety of cohesive devices. 

Writing 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)
Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Errors of grammar are rare including those in low frequency complex structures. Consistently able to tailor language to suit audience and able to express subtleties and nuances. Expository prose is clearly, consistently and explicitly organized. The writer employs a variety of organizational patterns, uses a wide variety of cohesive devices such as ellipses and parallelisms, 

and subordinates in a variety of ways. Able to write on all topics normally pertinent to professional and educational needs and on social issues of a general nature. Writing adequate to express all his/her experiences. 

Writing 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a wide variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. May have some ability to edit but not in the full range of styles. Has some flexibility within a style and shows some evidence of a use of stylistic devices. 

Writing 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency)
Has writing proficiency equal to that of a well educated native. Without non-native errors of structure, spelling, style or vocabulary can write and edit both formal and informal correspondence, official reports and documents, and professional/ educational articles including writing for special purposes which might include legal, technical, educational, literary and colloquial writing. In addition to being clear, explicit and informative, the writing and the ideas are also imaginative. The writer employs a very wide range of stylistic devices.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective vendors. Question 1: Is this strictly 'clean and paint' or is there some restorative work needed? Answer 1: The antenna requires a complete pressure wash. The removal of rust and treating of the affected areas are required before painting will be required. A primer coat is also required for any treated areas. Question 2: Is the 18-meter antenna only a dish, or is it housed within a dome? Answer 2: The 18-meter antenna is a elevation over azimuth tracking system. Mounted on a 57 foot concrete pedestal, all of which requires painting. This includes all access stairs and platforms. Question 3: What is the 18-meter antenna made of (fiberglass, aluminum, steel)? Answer 3: The 18-meter parabolic antenna is made of 6061 aluminum. The rest of the structure is made of galvanized steel. Question 4: Is the 18-meter antenna on a building, or a tower, or on the ground (pedestal)? Answer 4: The system is mounted on a concrete pedestal. Question 5: What is the azimuth of the antenna? (Will affect scaffolding requirements.) Answer 5: Due to the configuration of the system scaffolding will not be usable. A manlift or Bucket-truck with a 100 foot reach may be the only way to reach all of the areas that are to be addressed. Question 6: Can you provide any pictures and/or drawings of the 18-meter antenna? Answer 6: Please see the picture available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfp/07ks02.htm.

FAR 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2006) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition.  The provision at 52.212-2 EVALUATION?COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition with the following inserted information under paragraph (a):  The following factors shall be used to evaluated offers:

The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and price.  The following technical factors will be evaluated and are listed in descending order of importance:
 
(1)  Technical Approach 
(2)	 Past Experience/Performance.     

Technical Approach:     
Technical proposal shall be no longer than 6 typed pages (12pt font), excluding pictures, illustrations,  drawings, and copy of AvL quote.  It must include a detailed description of the product and all of its capabilities.  It must include an overview of similar systems and some of the customers using them.  It must include pictures of the system, single line drawings, and similar systems.  A copy of Avl?s quote (price may be deleted) is required to ensure all of the features of the special NAVAIR version are being provided.   It must describe your knowledge and understanding of the technical requirements and identify the methodology and analytical techniques you will use to manage the work and ensure that all SOW requirements are met.  Offers will be evaluated on the demonstrated ability to provide a technical approach that integrates the tasking into a cohesive effort that can be accomplished with minimal risk.   

Required Past Experience/Performance Documentation:
The offeror shall provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks as required by this SOW and at least two (2) years of experience producing similar products within the past three (3) years.  If the offeror will subcontract any significant part of this effort, the offeror must provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks for those subcontractors.  The offeror shall provide applicable contractor names, contract numbers, contract dollar values, description of product provided, and periods of performance.  Each narrative shall also include the name, area code and phone number, mailing and e-mail address of the person from each identified contractor who can verify the offerors past experience/ performance.  The Past Experience/Performance Documentation shall be no longer than 3 typed pages (12pt font).  The Government will conduct reference checks on performance, customer satisfaction with respect to technical quality of product provided, ability to meet contractual schedules, management responsiveness, and cost control.  The Government will also evaluate the relevance of the offeror's past experience/performance compared to the requirements specified in the SOW.  The Government may supplement the information you provide with performance information it may obtain from any other reliable source including its own experience with your firm (or Subcontractor).  Offerors unable to fully demonstrate they have successfully completed two (2) similar tasks to this SOW in the past three (3) years will be considered to be a higher risk to the Government and as a result may not be considered for award.	

The technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, to the extent that the offers become more equal in the technical and past performance factors, then price takes on added significance.
