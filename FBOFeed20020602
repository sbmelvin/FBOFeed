<SUBJECT>16 -- Noise Reduction System for C-9B Aircraft
<SOLNBR>N00019-02-R-3153
<RESPDATE>051002
<CONTACT>Scott Vitarelli, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-8963, Fax null, Email vitarellisd@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to contract for a Noise Reduction System for the C-9B (DC-9-32F) Aircraft.  This effort will require a Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate for Navy C-9B Aircraft that meets or exceeds the Stage III Noise Levels as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Chapter 1, Part36.5(a)3, appendix C.  This is a non-developmental effort; the Government is seeking a Noise Reduction System with proven performance in the commercial fleet.  In addition, the modification must meet the following requirements:

1.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight of 110,000 pounds must be maintained.
2.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Landing Weight of 102,000 pounds with 40 degree Approach Flaps must be maintained.
3.	The rated engine thrust of a Stage II Configured Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines, as currently used on the C-9B Aircraft, must not be adversely affected.
4.	Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the currently installed Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines must not be adversely affected.
5.	Reliability and maintainability of Navy C-9B Aircraft and JT8D-9A Engines, as currently configured, must not be adversely affected.
6.	Any increase in Aircraft Empty Weight must not exceed 350 pounds.
7.	The system must be supportable by 2-level maintenance concept, O to D.
8.	The system should require no new or critical logistics support resource requirements.
9.	Must not require any additional transportability requirements.

The Government intends to award either one or two firm fixed price contracts for two of the major tasks required to complete this modification: 1. Acquisition of the STC Data and airframe parts required; and, 2.  Installation/integration of the airframe parts and JT8D-9A Engines, following modification o fthose engines to a Stage III configuration.  All work is to be accomplished in accordance with the FAA STC, the Navy Approved Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and the Pratt & Whitney Approved Maintenance Manual for the JT8D-9A Engine.  Prospective offerors may submit proposals for one, or both, of these tasks.  The offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government will be awarded a contract for that task.  If one offeror provides the best value for performing both tasks, one contract will be awarded to that offeror.    

The Government will require a review of all technical data presented to the FAA as the basis for granting of the Stage III Hushkit Supplemental Type Certificate (STC).  This data is required to ensure specific Navy-unique operational requirements are not adversely affected.  In any event, and regardless of whether such data were submitted to the FAA, the Government specifically requires the following data:

Ground Test Data -

Required Engine Performance Parameter Data During Ground Tests With Throttle Transients

a.  PLA (Power Lever Angle) vs Time
b.  Fuel Flow vs Time
c.  EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) vs Time
d.  Thrust vs Time
e.  EPR (Engine Pressure Ratio) vs Time
f.  Ps-3 (Low Pressure Compressor Discharge Pressure) vs Time

NOTE: All data should be provided in a graphical format and the position (i.e. open or closed) of the Engine Bleed Valves identified.

Flight Test Data

Required Engine Performance Parameter Data During Approach To Stall

a.  AOA (Angle Of Attack) vs Time
b.  PLA vs Time
c.  Fuel Flow vs Time
d.  EGT vs Time
e.  Thrust vs Time
f.  EPR vs Time

The Government is also interested in reviewing any additional information, not listed above, that would assist the Government in ascertaining that Navy-unique requirements will not be adversely affected by the modification.  If these specific data are not available, or the data presented determined to be inadequate, the Navy will perform, at Government expense, and in cooperation with the contractor, ground, and/or flight testing as necessary to support Navy-unique requirements.

Thisprocurement will be conducted using the principles outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Navy intends to release the Request for Proposals, including any subsequent amendments, only over the Internet.  The solicitation will reside on the NAVAIR Home Page located on the World Wide Web (WWW).  The WWW server may be accessed using client browsers such as NETSCAPE and INTERNET EXPLORER.
