This advertisement serves to aid in determining market interest and capabilities for this prospective contract. Of the available strategies, FLCJ is considering the viability of the following options:  Acquisition to be processed through full and open competition  after exclusion socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, Section 8(a) suitability, and Total Small Business set-aside.

From the responses to this market research, the Government will assess the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy.
 Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your company's business interests. If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an “UNRESTRICTED” basis.

It is anticipated that any resulting contract would be accomplished under the provisions of a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract, with a base year and two one-year option periods. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 336412 with a size standard of 1000 employees. If your company is interested in competing for this requirement, provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate assessment of the contractor capabilities.
