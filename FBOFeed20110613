<DESC><p>This RFI is intended to identify interesed parties for the following: Please submit a Rough Order of Magnitude/estimated costs and top level, best practice solution ideas. Also please note that this RFI is regarding system consolidation, NOT a personnel consolidation or relocation. This RFI is related to FA8217-11-R-CALLCTR posted on March 3, 2011.</p>
<p>1. Objective: The objective of this Task Order is to Engineer, Furnish, Install, and Test (EFI&amp;T) an Enterprise solution to consolidate all ACC (Air Combat Command) telephone operator functions into two regional call centers (East Coast Call Center located at Langley AFB VA and West coast Call Center located at Beale AFB CA). Offeror shall provide all hardware, software, licensing and training required for the use of the system. The overall objective is to upgrade the existing T-Metrics infrastructure at both call centers required for operator consolidation.</p>
<p>1.1. The host call centers will be used to remotely handle telephone calls for thirteen bases divided between call centers. A key requirement for centralization within ACC is a completely redundant enterprise architecture model where each call center is fully backed-up by the other call center in a COOP fashion. We have identified Beale and Langley for perspective locations.</p>
<p>2. Background: ACC has thirteen bases with operator functions provided under individual contracts. The objective is to improve system reliability and interoperability by implementing a common platform throughout ACC and reduce/eliminate telephone operator positions to reduce total cost of ownership while improving maintainability. Operator services to be centralized include but are not limited to Directory Assistance, Operator assistance, base locator services, morale call services, conferencing, precedence calls and command and control support, senior level support and local information, records maintenance. Due to Air Force restructuring missions, the government retains the right to remove any specific base from this task order.</p>
<p>3. Program Technical Requirement: The solution will integrate with other CITS network management tools and voice network management tools at the enterprise level. It shall be able to share database information with AHAMS, performance monitoring and alarms, security monitoring, and account management data with the CITS Network Management Systems, TMS and AHAMS. The system shall be open and flexible for quick, end-to-end implementation by integrating easily with third-party call center technologies, such as ACDs, CTI middleware, and enterprise resource planning systems, or other third-party applications and hardware. The solution must be able to process operator call data for all Air Force voice systems supporting telephone operator consoles and systems within its region. This includes, but is not limited to, the Nortel MSL-100/CS-2100, Nortel Meridian 1, and Avaya S8700 voice systems. It is important that the solution selected is vendor independent to allow flexibility in major voice system acquisitions.

<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS: Funds are not presently available for this project. No award will be made under this solicitation until the funds are available. The government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation/RFP either before or after the RFP closing date. In the event that the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.<br /><br />Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer for this project is Mr. Bill Carbrey. Mr. Carbrey can be reached at 316-759-4513 or at william.carbrey@us.af.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Rapid HIV Self-Testing among MSM in High Prevalence Cities
<SOLNBR>2011-N-13417
<ARCHDATE>06272011
<CONTACT>Jerry W. Outley, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2831, Fax 770-488-2868, Email jmo4@cdc.gov
<DESC>C.1 BACKGROUND AND NEED
<p>Innovative testing strategies are needed to reduce levels of undiagnosed HIV infection and increase early access to treatment. The availability of a HIV self-test may facilitate access to testing among individuals who have never been tested due to concerns about privacy and confidentiality and may increase compliance with current CDC HIV testing recommendations for those who require regular testing due to on-going risk behavior. Rapid HIV self-tests may play an important role in efforts to reduce both HIV morbidity and mortality. Self-test HIV kits may reduce HIV incidence by helping HIV-negative persons remain free from infection (primary prevention), as well as increase early diagnoses of those who are infected (secondary prevention). Policies that guide the public-health application and use of rapid HIV self-test kits, require data on whether persons at high risk for infection will use these tests, the effectiveness of the tests for primary and secondary prevention, and the utility of the tests in promoting additional testing and linkage to HIV services of persons with preliminary positive results.</p>
<p>Repeat testing may be particularly important for men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk of transmitting HIV since infections in the earliest stages are associated with high viral loads and potential for transmission. MSM account for nearly half of the more than one million people living with HIV in the U.S. and they account for more than half of all new HIV infections in the U.S. each year. While MSM account for just 4 percent of the U.S. male population aged 13 and older, the rate of new HIV diagnoses among MSM in the U.S. is more than 44 times that of other men. MSM are the only risk group in the U.S. in which new HIV infections are increasing. While new infections have declined among both heterosexuals and injection drug users, the annual number of new HIV infections among MSM has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The exceptionally high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection among MSM and plausibly high transmission risks to partners who are attempting to avoid infection through HIV-negative serosorting, suggests that MSM and their partners stand to benefit the most from a rapid HIV self test. This is especially true for black and Hispanic MSM. One report suggests that young black MSM have nearly 7-times greater adjusted odds for being unaware of their HIV infection relative to young white MSM. Despite this racial disparity, young black MSM (relative to young white MSM) are equally likely to perceive themselves at low risk for infection and are nearly equally as likely to disclose being HIV-negative to new sex partners. Of black MSM with HIV who were unaware of their infection, up to 22% of their new partners reported being HIV-negative. However, of Hispanic and white MSM with HIV who were unaware of their infection, only 3% of new partners of Hispanic MSM and 4% of new partners of white MSM disclosed being HIV-negative.</p>
<p>As of March 2011, the FDA has approved several rapid HIV tests for use at point-of-care to aid in the diagnosis of HIV. Several of these tests have received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) waiver for use in non-clinical settings by persons without formal laboratory training and they are accurate, safe, and simple to use. Currently, OraSure Inc. has applied to the FDA for an over-the-counter (OTC) labeling of OraQuick Advance.</p>
<p>While manufacturers that seek OTC labeling of rapid HIV tests are obligated to conduct studies to meet FDA requirements on device safety and accuracy, manufacturers will not be required to conduct studies that evaluate the public-health benefit of these tests. Thus, without CDC-supported research, data will not exist to guide the development of public-health policy and programs on the dissemination and use of OTC rapid HIV self tests when they become available. In the absence of such guidelines, CDC will not be able to take full advantage of a promising new application of rapid HIV tests for primary and secondary prevention efforts targeting persons at high risk for infection.</p>
<p>Given the unrelenting HIV crisis among MSM and the imminent release into the market of rapid HIV self-test kits, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of providing rapid HIV self-test kits on repeat HIV testing, linkage to care, partner testing, serosorting, and HIV sexual risk behaviors among MSM to determine the potential primary and secondary prevention effectiveness of OTC rapid HIV self tests. This information will assist DHAP in developing recommendations and future research and program needs concerning self-testing for MSM to aid in identifying undiagnosed cases of HIV infection and promoting linkage to care of persons with HIV.</p>
<p><br />C.2 PURPOSE/PROJECT OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to assess the use and impact of rapid HIV self-testing among MSM located in up to three high HIV prevalence cities in the United States. <br />The primary research questions to be addressed by the contractor are:<br />1. Does provision of self-test kits increase the frequency of HIV testing among high-risk MSM to at least three times in 12 months?<br />2. What proportion of persons with a preliminary positive result go on to request, be referred to, and access follow-up testing and care services (e.g., primary care provider, health department, or local AIDS service provider)? <br />3. Does the provision of self test kits to high-risk HIV-negative or unknown serostatus MSM increase the distribution and use of rapid HIV self-test kits to their social and sexual network affiliates?<br />4. Does the provision of self-test kits to HIV-positive MSM increase the distribution and use of test kits to their social and sexual network affiliates?<br />5. Does the provision of self-test kits change sexual behaviors among study participants (e.g. number of partners, unprotected anal intercourse, and serosorting practices)?<br />6. How do program participants perceive the possible uses, benefits and drawbacks of self testing and what are participant's self-testing preferences, in terms of accessing kits, cost, HIV information, and access to supportive services?</p>
<p>The contractor shall recruit a minimum of 3,200 high-risk MSM who are HIV negative or of unknown serostatus, and a minimum of 300 HIV positive MSM (based upon self-report). (Using a binary outcome of success as having &ge;3 HIV tests per year and the chi-square test at the 5% significance level, we have 90% power to detect a difference between the comparison and intervention groups if the success rates in these groups are 5% and 10% respectively. We inflated the sample size to allow for a maximum 40% attrition rate). Of these men, at least 20% shall be black MSM and 15% shall be Hispanic MSM to allow for appropriate analytical comparisons. To be eligible for the study, participants must be: MSM who are age 18 and over; reside in the participating jurisdiction(s) proposed by contractor and approved by COTR; and report unprotected anal sex with more than one male partner in the past year. Recruitment of subjects shall begin approximately 18 months after award, depending on receipt of required approvals to begin research study. Recruitment of study subjects shall be completed within 9 months. An additional 14 months shall be used to complete the 12 month follow-up period for all subjects. Therefore, all research activities shall be completed within 4 years.</p>
<p>The research study will consist of three study conditions that are based on a participant's disclosure of HIV status at time of enrollment. HIV negative and unknown status subjects shall be randomized to one of two study conditions: an intervention or comparison condition. HIV positive participants will not be randomized but assigned to a third study condition. The contractor shall recruit participants via the internet, and potentially other methods. The contractor shall develop and maintain a web-based system where interested participants will access a secure internet study specific website where screening, enrollment, consent, randomization and assessments will occur. In addition to conducting a baseline assessment, the contractor shall develop and maintain a web-based system where all participants complete follow-up assessments to be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. The contractor shall provide participants with incentives following completion of each assessment so that the study will achieve an anticipated retention rate of 80% at each follow-up point. The contractor shall randomize the HIV-negative/unaware participants into two study arms after completing the baseline assessment. The contractor shall provide (mail or email) participants in the comparison condition with a resource page/brochure containing information on local HIV testing and other support services for MSM. The contractor shall provide participants in the intervention condition and all HIV-positive arm participants with up to 5 rapid test kits (by mail) and the resource brochure (by mail or email), upon request, at each assessment point. The contractor shall provide thethe option of requesting a kit that allows oral fluid collection or blood (finger-stick) collection. The contractor shall have a mechanism to assist person with preliminary positive results with counseling, referral, and assistance to accessing testing and care services. The contractor shall develop and maintain a web-based system where all persons who use the self-test kits can enter the result of the test and provide feedback on their experience with using the test kit. All persons who use the self-test kit, have a preliminary positive result, and contact the study counselor/referral coordinator by phone or email will be referred or if requested, provided assistance with linkage to local services by the contactor to a local site for appropriate follow-up testing and care services.</p>
<p>The study also includes a qualitative component to better understand how participants used the test kits, attitudes about self-testing, perceived benefits and drawbacks of self-testing, unintended consequences, and preferences for future program implementation. Five focus groups will be conducted in each participating city (k=15) with a total of approximately 50 men per city. Participants assigned to the intervention arm will be invited to indicate their interest in participating in a focus group discussion after completing the 12 month survey. After a sufficient number of potential focus group participants have been accrued, study staff will randomly select a sample to follow-up to ascertain interest and availability. Contractor staff shallshall travel, as needed to each study city to conduct and record the face-to-face focus groups. Other mechanisms for convening participants (e.g., online focus groups, conference calls or online chats) can be discussed. The contractor shall implement a mechanism to ensure focus group participation. The contractorshall record and transcribe discussions, enter the data into a qualitative software analysis program, and conduct analysis. A written summary of the qualitative findings, the analytic database, transcripts, and audio-recordings shall be supplied to CDC by the Contractor.. <br />Specific objectives of the contract include the following:<br />1. Obtain and confirm required Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of management and Budget (OMB) approvals.<br />2. Design, develop and implement a secure study website to include a participant recruitment interface.<br />3. Develop and implement internet capable screening, enrollment, and consent procedures. <br />4. Develop and implement a web-based data collection system for all quantitative data activities (surveys and test results from self-test kits).<br />5. Develop and implement a participant tracking system which securely houses participant contact information (e.g., names, email address, mailing address, phone number), and automates reminder email notifications.<br />6. Develop and implement a confidential rapid HIV self-test kit and delivery system according to study protocol.<br />7. For persons testing preliminary positive, develop and implement a counseling, referral and linkage system protocol that includes supplemental testing. <br />8. Develop and implement a system to routinely monitor the progress of the accrual of study participants and make adjustments as necessary.<br />9. Conduct focus groups.<br />10. Produce interim and final progress reports.<br />11. Create and deliver semi-annual data sets and final data sets. Create and deliver a final report of the qualitative findings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />C.3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor will implement a three condition research study using a protocol developed by the contractor and approved by CDC. The study will assess the impact of providing rapid HIV self-test kits to MSM, coupled with phone-based counseling and referral to local testing and care services. Research activities shall be conducted in at least one, and up to three of the top 10 US jurisdictions with the highest HIV prevalence rates among MSM. In this study, CDC will not be engaged in counducting research activities and CDC staff will not have access to personal identifiable information. Therefore, CDC IRB will not be obtained. This study will identify and quantify the use of the HIV self-test kits, changes in sexual behaviors, changes in HIV testing practices, and the use of phone-based counseling, supplemental testing and linkage to care. The contractor shall produce a final report and final dataset to be submitted to CDC at the end of the contract.</p>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen: <br />Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-2379<br />email: kim.diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>

<p>This project is located on the Sitka Ranger District of the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska, near the town of Tenakee Springs on the northeastern portion of Chichagof Island.

The town is accessible via the Alaska Marine Highway System and floatplane service from both Juneau and Sitka. There is no direct road connection between Tenakee Springs and the project area. The project area is accessed from the Corner Bay road system, which originates at a log transfer facility (LTF) on the opposite side of Tenakee Inlet from the town, approximately four miles to the southeast. There is a Forest Service dock facility adjacent to the LTF where small boats may be moored. There is also a bulkhead at this location where full-sized vehicles and/or ATVs can be offloaded by barge or landing craft. The majority of the Corner Bay road system is open to both full-sized vehicles and ATV traffic.<br /><br />Because of the uniqueness of Southeast Alaska regarding access, logistics, and service points, it is strongly recommended that prospective Contractors adequately familiarize themselves with the area to help determine mobilization costs, living, and travel expenses.</p>

The offeror selected shall furnish all labor, materials, tools, equipment, management, and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of this project.
DESCRIPTION: The work of this contract shall include hazardous waste remediation; demolition of buildings; demolition of roads and paving; demolition of above ground utilities including site features; and removal of abandoned construction debris located on the site.  A smaller component, but crucial aspect, of the contract will involve some site restoration at the former Bureau of Mines Campus (Campus).    
BACKGROUND: The 27.32-acre area of the Campus is located within the boundaries of the historic Fort Snelling Military Reservation in Hennepin County, Minnesota.  The property consists of a partially wooded area adjacent to Fort Snelling State Park near the intersection of State Highways (SH) 62 and 55 (Hiawatha Avenue).  There are 12 buildings with associated infrastructure and ore bins on site that were constructed from 1949 to 1989.  The Campus permanently closed in April 1996.  
In addition, the site contains Coldwater Spring.  The spring has cultural, spiritual, and environmental importance to American Indians; other interest groups; as well as individuals. Late in the 1800s, a springhouse, reservoir and related waterworks infrastructure were constructed to supply water to the Fort and the city of Minneapolis.  Currently, the springhouse and reservoir remain.  These items will remain and need to be protected during demolition and restoration activity on adjacent land.  (The restoration of the spring house and reservoir will not be part of this contract.)
Because this area was used by American Indians, this area may have human remains and associated funerary objects may be encountered during building and infrastructure removal or land restoration work.  All reasonable efforts shall be made to avoid disturbing American Indian grave sites and associated artifacts.  If human remains or associated funerary objects are encountered all work in the immediate and surrounding area shall stop.  MISS and Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) will be notified immediately.  
TYPE OF ACQUISITION: A negotiated, firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. TheGovernment will consider an offeror's technical capability, past performance, and price to determine the best value (trade-off process) to the Government.
The NAICS code for this project is 238910, Site Preparation Contractors, and the small business size is $14 million. The estimated price range for this contract is $2,000,000 to $2,600,000. The contract duration is 365 calendar days (November 2011 to November 2012) following the notice to proceed.

<SUBJECT>J--INLS Side Connector Overhaul and Repair
<SOLNBR>N0002511R0001
<RESPDATE>053111
<ARCHDATE>08052011
<CONTACT>Michael Fanizzo Jr. (202) 685 6017
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO) has a requirement for the overhaul and repair of Side Connectors, Remote Hydraulic Carts and 8ft X 8ft X 20ft ISO 668 Containers. The overhaul and repair will take place at the contractor's facility. 

The Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) Side Connector System consists of two major assemblies: the INLS Side Connector and the Remote Hydraulic Cart. The main purpose of the connector is to provide a means of connecting INLS Combination Modules (CMs) side-by-side to form a rigid connection. The connectors mate with female pockets located on the side of each CM when engaged. The connectors are designed to be capable of operation through Sea State 2 and survive in Sea State 4.

The connector is a two-trapezoidal box structure which houses four bullets at top and four at bottom for connection.
 These eight bullets work in pairs and are moved inward or outward by hydraulic cylinders with control connections at the top of the connector. Each bullet engages with a female socket that conforms to the shape of the bullet. Female sockets are cast in the CMs. The objective is to use four side connectors to hold two CMs together side-to-side. For each connector, all eight bullets engage the female sockets forming a rigid joint. The hydraulic power is supplied via flexible quick disconnect hoses that connect to the top of each connector. 

The Remote Hydraulic Cart provides the means to hydraulically power and electrically monitor the connector operation. The cart receives 2500 psi hydraulic pressure from a separate hydraulic power unit to a hose connection into the back of the cart.
 Electrical power (24 VDC) is provided via a generator located in the crew shelter and cabling into the back of the cart.

The wheeled cart houses a mobile multifaster, remote control station, electrical interface box, manifold assembly, gage panel and floodlight. The mobile multifaster is designed to mate with the hydraulic and electrical connections on the connector's fixed multifaster. The remote control station contains the operator controls and indicators for operation of the connector. The remote control station is operated via a hand held tethered remote. The manifold has five solenoid operated valves (one for circulation of fluid and four for supply/return to the connector cylinders).
 The gauge panel is provided with four pressure gauges, one for each of the side connector lines.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12, in conjunction with FAR 13, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible vendor whose offer best conforms to the specifications, meets the Government's delivery schedule and is the most cost effective in accordance with the following Evaluation Criteria: Award shall be based on the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those that are in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular. It is the contractor?s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. Clause 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause and 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items are hereby incorporated by reference. The provisio n at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Offerors are reminded to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications, Commercial Items, which can be accessed at http://www.arnet.far.gov.  The successful offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award. The CCR database may be accessed at www.ccr.gov. The US Environmental Protection Agency Region 4 Laboratory in Athens, GA, shall purchase a segmented flow analyzer consisting of two channels that will automatically analyze multiple environmental samples of various complex matrices for Ammonia and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) on separate channels. The Segmented Flow Analyzer (SFA) system for nutrient analysis shall comply with all commercial industry standards and meet the following minimum specifications: SAMPLE THROUGHPUT-The system must be able to meet or exceed analy zing 60 samples per hour for both EPA Methods 350.1 Ammonia and 351.2 TKN to maintain current lab productivity. The vendor must supply current Method documentation showing the sample rate (including sample and wash time) of the proposed methods. This is necessary especially for high priority projects and environmental disasters that require quick analysis and data reporting (e.g., Deepwater Horizon, Hurricane Katrina, etc.). SYSTEM COMPONENTS-Autosampler; Pump; Chemistry test module; Digital Photometer; Computer; Flat screen monitor; Printer; Applications/Instrument Software; and Technical Support, Training, Warranty, and Service. AUTOSAMPLER SPECS-Sampler must be a random access XY-2 Sampler that can access any cup at any time and can sample from cups multiple times. This is necessary for duplicate sampling, normal run quality control samples, and automatic reanalysis of off scale or carryover affected samples; Sampler must be able to hold at least 100 samples to accommodat e analysis of calibration standards, quality control samples, and project samples in a single run, rather than multiple, thus minimizing waste production and maintaining laboratory productivity; Sampler must have a PEEK sample probe for analyzing highly acidic samples, such as TKN digests, without the corrosion of the probe. PUMP SPECS-The pump must be a SEPARATE module, not part of an integrated system, so it can be interchanged or added to if necessary; pump must have a digital air injection system that is synchronized with the pump rollers to ensure that air bubbles are of equal size and spacing allowing for high analytical precision; air bubble injection timing must use an optical switch which is not subject to mechanical wear so that the bubble timing remains constant during the lifetime of the pump allowing for analytical consistency; pump must be fitted with an easily accessible emergency off switch on top of the pump in case of leak detection or other hydraulic issue s; pump must be fitted with a leak detector which automatically stops the pump motor and sends a signal to the software indicating that a leak has occurred; pump must be a quick connect system for easy pump tube changing; pump must have a computer controlled automatic intermittent mode that is activated once a run is complete and switches the pump to a reduced speed to save reagents and reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the pump tubes; and pump must be capable of automated switching to high speed for instrument washout. CHEMISTRY TEST MODULE SPECS-The chemistry module must be able to hold at least two analytical cartridges: one for ammonia analysis and the other for TKN analysis. The system must be modular with 1:1 module replacement; chemistry test module must be fitted with EPA approved manifolds that are in accordance with EPA method 350.1 for Ammonia analysis and EPA method 351.2 for TKN analysis; chemistry manifolds must be multi-test which make it possible to change  from one method to another without any manual switching of manifolds or pump tubes; chemistry manifolds must be supported with method documentation that includes the preparation of reagents and standards, performance data, reagent safety data, manifold component part numbers, list of spares and consumables with part numbers so that conformance to EPA methods can be easily verified; all hydraulic components of the manifold must be made of glass due to its inert properties in order to avoid any interference from equipment materials; hydraulic components must have an internal diameter of 2.0 mm to limit the risk of blockage from complex environmental samples; chemistry module must be fitted with heating baths for each manifold. These heating baths must be fitted with a thermometer to easily monitor the temperature, must be highly accurate at maintaining a specified temperature and have a user-replaceable coil; and chemistry module must be fitted with a leak detector to prevent  damage of the analyzer in the event of a buildup of liquid or reagents. DIGITAL PHOTOMETER SPECS-The system must not require debubbling before the flowcell. The bubble must pass through the flowcell and the software must utilize a software debubbling algorithm. This is necessary to reduce carryover and increase sample throughput. The vendor must provide pictures and documentation from the operator manual to illustrate and confirm that the system does this; the detector must be a true dual beam detection system with same-wavelength correction for high stability.  Specifically, the original beam from the single light source must be split in the same fiber optic path. Both beams must pass through and share a single optical wavelength filter, and reach the same detector at exactly the same time. This enables real time reference and sample data to be calculated ensuring ultimate stability and reproducibility of results. The vendor must provide schematics and documentation from th e operator manual to illustrate and confirm this; each detector must have its own light source which is automatically controlled by the software for the intensity which will allow optimization for each method run on that channel; the photometer must be High Resolution (HR) and have a sensitivity of at least 0.001 AUFS to enable low concentrations to be measured accurately and provide low detection limits as required by the EPA methods; the detector must be able to accommodate flow cells with varying path lengths allowing for method optimization; baseline and sensitivity must be controlled automatically from instrument software; and the detection system must have the same temperature air circulated as the chemistry manifold to ensure the lowest possible detection limits and highest precision of data. COMPUTER SPECS-Dell Optiplex GX620 (specs @ Dell.com) OR EQUAL and shall meet the requirements for USEPA Energy Star compliance. FLAT SCREEN MONITOR SPECS-Dell Monitor or equal,  must be compatible with computer system and shall meet the requirements for USEPA Energy Star compliance. PRINTER SPECS-HP P2055d (specs at HP.com) OR EQUAL and shall meet the requirements for USEPA Energy Star compliance. APPLICATIONS/ INSTRUMENT SOFTWARE SPECS-Software must be capable of running under the Windows XP and/or Windows 7 operating system; software must adapt to the hardware of each individual system and allow each electronic component (e.g. sampler, pump, detector, etc) to be controlled from the software; software must allow samples to be added at any time during a run and sample tray must be changeable before, during, and after a run; software must be capable of no cal runs so that samples can be scanned prior to analysis for necessary dilutions; software must be capable of calibrating with up to 10 calibration points; Software must have the option for linear or quadratic calibration fits; software must automatically calculate and display the correlation coeff icient.  In addition, the calibration curve must be displayed and available to print; software must allow for display of the peak trace (graph of the analytical run) and printing of the trace after the analysis and store this information to be recalled upon demand; software allows for baseline, drift, or carryover corrections as desired; calibration or other run parameters can be changed and results recalculated after the run; peak markers can be moved manually after run in case of incorrect marking. Moved markers and the results that were affected are uniquely identified on data; and Run data can be exported to ASCII file for LIMS import. TECHNICAL UPPORT/TRAINING/WARRANTY/SERVICE-The system must have at least a one year warranty on parts and labor which begins once the system is installed and fully operational in the laboratory; vendor shall provide on-site delivery, installation of equipment and at least a 2-day training course to operators. Installation and training MUST  be included in the quoted price of the system and will cover system operation maintenance and trouble-shooting; vendor must have a Technical Support staff which are direct employees of the vendor, degreed scientists, and have a response time of 24 hours maximum; Technical Support must be directly available by email, telephone, or fax during normal business hours; and vendor must have field based technical specialists available for on-site repair.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY - Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services for the Fire Alarms and Mechanical Upgrades Project at the John C. Kluczynski (JCK) Federal Building and US Loop Post Office (LPO) Facility

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity to provide Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services for the Fire Alarms and Mechanical Upgrades project at the John C. Kluczynski (JCK) Federal Building and the US Loop Post Office Facility in Chicago, Illinois. This is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Project. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and an option for Construction Phase Services. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 Trade Offs). The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers, but discussions may be held if appropriate. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $70,000,000 to $80,000,000.</p>
<p><br />Project Summary: This project consists of the following to be completed at the John C. Kluczynski Federal Building.&nbsp; A new fire alarm system, fire stopping in the building support closets, replacement of the perimeter fan coil system, upgrades to the restrooms, upgrades to the building core finishes and signage, and miscellaneous HVAC system upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp; Work to be completed at the US Loop Post Office includes a new fire alarm system and miscellaneous HVAC system upgrades.&nbsp; Additional scope items may be added to the project during the program validation stage which may include relocation and reconfiguration of the basement level space, lighting upgrades, and reconfiguration of existing tenant space.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor: A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to: evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Stage Services and Construction Stage Work.&nbsp; The Construction Stage Work is an option.&nbsp; The Contractor is required to complete the Pre-design and Design Stage Services for the firm-fixed-price set forth in the Contract Price Schedule. If the Government exercises the option for the Construction Phase Work, the contractor shall complete the Construction Phase Work at or below the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).</p>

<DESC>The Veterans Administration administers benefits claims on behalf of America's Veterans.   Among the various claims programs administered by the VA are the disability compensation benefit program.  This program is administered in 57 Regional Offices (ROs) but the scope of this includes only the 56 ROs that are domestic sites (the 57th is Manila which is outside the U.S.).  It provides a monetary benefit to Veterans who are disabled by injuries or illnesses that were incurred or aggravated during active military service.  These disabilities are considered to be "service-connected."  The amount of disability compensation payable varies with the degree of disability (if 30% or more disabled) and the number of dependents, and is paid monthly.  Veterans may file claims for increased compensation benefits at any time if their service-connected disabilities become progressively worse.  Veterans with certain severe disabilities may be eligible for additional special monthly compensation.  The benefits are not subject to federal or state income tax. 

Veterans already receiving compensation may encounter deterioration of existing conditions that require re-evaluation for increased compensation.  Typically, this category of claims is among the least complex to develop, but nevertheless requires significant time and effort to develop complete packages of evidence in order to decide the claim.  Expedited development and evidence package assembly by the contractor will reduce waiting times in communications between the Veteran, medical providers, and VA, facilitating timely compilation of fully developed packages that will be used for final evaluation of whether an increased evaluation is warranted.  The work described in this PWS contributes to VA's mission by directly reducing the time and effort to fully develop claims and make them ready for decision.

This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611710 - Educational Support Services.<br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure educational support services to support the Institutional Animal Care &amp; Use Committee (IACUC) best practices conference planning initiative on behalf of the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) at the National Institutes of Health. <br />Title: OLAW IACUC Administrator's Best Practices Meetings<br />BACKGROUND
<p>The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), OER, NIH, is responsible for the general administration and implementation of the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and does this through a variety of educational and assurance mechanisms. One such mechanism is the support of educational workshops and conferences. There is a particular need for basic training of incoming Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) members in the practical implementation of the PHS Policy and in advanced and complex topics affecting IACUCs, and for educational opportunities that address how to achieve and coordinate compliance with the major oversight systems, including OLAW/PHS. <br />Specific Tasks</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the vendor will present approximately two "IACUC Administrator's Best Practices Meetings" each year.</p>
<p>The vendor will make a concerted effort to solicit appropriate participation of women, racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in science, in accord with the NIH Policy "Guidelines on Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in NIH Sponsored Intramural and Extramural Scientific Meetings and Conferences." (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not95-123.html)</p>

Participants with disabilities will be permitted to voluntarily identify any special needs.<br /><br />Each Meeting will be open to all individuals completing the appropriate registration form and paying any registration fees, until such time as physical capacity for the sessions is reached.</p>
<p>The program will focus on topics of interest to IACUC administrators with a particular emphasis on the requirements of the PHS Policy. They will provide a basic yet comprehensive overview of the laws, regulations, and policies that govern the humane care and use of laboratory animals supplemented with examples and possible approaches for successful and effective administration. There will be opportunities for participants to consider and discuss complex challenges to complying with PHS Policy.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to acquire conference planning and support for the "IACUC Administrator's Best Practices Meetings".<br />The specific current tasks include assistance on the following:</p>
<p>The "IACUC Administrator's Best Practices Meeting" is a unique working meeting of which IACUC staff and animal program operations personnel from across the country present and share best practices in the humane care and use of laboratory animals. The meeting format will facilitate development of methodologies to satisfy the requirements of the animal welfare laws and policies and include the opportunity to direct questions to representatives from OLAW, USDA, and AAALAC International. Topics for discussion will include practices for ensuring protocol and grant congruency, operating successful Occupational Health and Safety Programs, tracking animals used in research, and IACUC monitoring of approved protocols. Proceedings of the two-day program will be available to attendees.<br />Period of Performance: <br />It is anticipated that the period of performance for this requirement will be for approximately one year with for additional 12-month option periods from the date of award.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Washington TRU Solutions, LLC (WTS), is seeking interested parties for the competitive procurement of a renewable energy facility, to be located on US Department of Energy (DOE) property at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), near Carlsbad, New Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Background </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The WIPP is located in Eddy County in the Chihuahuan Desert of southeastern New Mexico, 26 miles east of Carlsbad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The WIPP safely disposes of the nation's defense-related transuranic radioactive waste 2,150 feet underground in a stable salt formation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The WIPP is a DOE facility that is managed and operated by WTS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">General Scope Description </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Electricity is a required utility as the WIPP relies on electrical power to perform the functions of the Plant. The objective of the New Mexico and Texas Energy Initiative's wind technology development is to augment the current source of electric power at a DOE facility (using existing federally withdrawn land) with a renewable source such as wind energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>WTS is seeking a private entity to design, construct, and operate a wind facility on Government property, and in parallel, to provide research and development of the wind technology in a less-than-optimal wind setting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">This project shall provide turnkey Contractor services for WTS and be financed by the selected source. These services shall be for the design, equipment &amp; material procurements, construction, start-up testing, plant personnel training, operation, and completion of project closeout documentation (such as submittal of as-built drawing "mark-ups").</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The project may also provide a research and development opportunity for the National Wind Resource Center (NWRC) to perform research and educational opportunities to further the use of new wind energy technologies, with a specific focus on development of technologies that are effective in a less-than-optimal wind setting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NWRC or an associated research entity shall have use of the data collected from the wind technology to promote energy technology development, performance, reliability and effectiveness as part of the research effort. </span></p>

<a href="mailto:anna.lopez1@us.army.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - SOURCES SOUGHT FOR SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT SUBSYSTEM (SMS)<br><br>1. Purpose<br><br>   Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), Fort Monmouth, NJ, is seeking information for a possible Spectrum Management Subsystem (SMS) that can be utilized to support both the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) satellites.  The DSCS satellite constellation has been available for over 20 years and may continue to be available through 2020.  The WGS constellation is still being constituted.  WGS provides many times the capacity of DSCS, much greater throughput, flexibility, power, and bandwidth to support Warfighter communication requirements.  As such, it is necessary for operators at Operations Control Facilities (OCF) to know the current state of each transponder and beam for the satellite.  The SMS may be deployed globally in support of all DSCS and WGS deployments.<br><br>   PM DCATS provides worldwide support for the Joint Warfighters by providing dedicated strategic satellite ground components and long haul terrestrial microwave communication systems, technical control facilities, command center upgrades, and deployed forces infrastructure.<br><br>   Requirements have been identified for a complete spectral analysis of transponders utilizing an SMS which can characterize the carriers on each transponder and provide an integrated snapshot to the operator both at the local OCF and at remote sites that are tied into the global OCF network.  The functionality is required for implementation at the first OCF within the next 6-7 months, in support of facilities upgrades.  As such proven commercial off the shelf (COTS) product(s) is desired. Proposed period of performance is from July 2011 - December 2012.<br><br>2. High Level Requirements for a SMS:<br><br>   a. Operational Bandwidth. The SMS shall provide a full spectrum view of satellites including DSCS and WGS.  DSCS operates over a 500 MHz bandwidth utilizing the Military X-Band.  WGS operates over the full Military X-band as well as over a 1 GHz range utilizing the Military Ka-Band, including frequency reuse.  The primary mode of monitoring WGS requires specialized synchronized signal acquisition and monitoring capability.    Additionally, the WGS provides unique features including matrix switching; any capability that can help characterize WGS unique functionality is highly desired.  There is a potential to utilize such tool for commercial C and Ku band transponders.<br><br>   b. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Capabilities.  The SMS shall be DSP based, and should allow for as wide an instantaneous usable bandwidth as possible (85MHz minimum, up to 500MHz is desired with a minimum of 12-bits of digitizer resolution) and should allow characterization of AJ spread waveforms.  The WGS satellite also has the capability to copy spectrum from remote beams, as seen by the satellite, and stream it down in a single carrier or broadcast to many individual beams.  The SMS must be capable of synchronizing with the downlink stream to allow reassembly of the spectrum.  The SMS shall support a full range of WGS sync channel dwell times from 100ms to 12.5sec (specifically selectable dwell times must be consistent with the current WGS payload design).  The SMS shall provide real-time frequency domain characterization and time domain characterization for sync channel dwell times down to 100ms.  The SMS shall support frequency domain characterization of 16MHz of sync channel bandwidth within a 50ms window, and time domain characterization rates of at least 25 1-MHz carriers per second.  DSP configuration and control via current standard TCP/IP is required.  Timing shall be capable of functioning with both 5MHz and 10MHz references.  To the maximum extent possible, the DSP chassis should be easily accessible and major components (power supplies, digitizers, down-converters, etc.) shall support hot swap replacement.<br>   <br>   c. Architecture.  The SMS architecture shall be modular and designed with scalability as a key design criterion.  The architecture shall support, to the greatest extent possible, a distributed instantiation.  This implies that any component of the architecture shall be capable, assuming adequate network resources, of being deployed in a "remote" configuration.<br><br>   d. Tuner capabilities. L-band tuning range of 950-2150MHz, with at least 30db of programmable gain/attenuation, using current standard TCP/IP for configuration and control.  <br><br>   e. Spectrum Characterization. The SMS shall provide a spectral view of all carriers, to include FDMA, AJ/AS (Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum (FHSS), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and hybrid FHSS/DSSS), and MF-TDMA/IP systems which utilize standard and/or proprietary waveforms.  The SMS shall process carriers that include IP Modems such as DVB-S, DVB-S2/RCS, Linkway (JNN), iDirect (CSS), the Network Centric Waveform (Proposed MIL-STD-188-EEE) and similar MF-TDMA systems.  The span time for characterizing the spectrum shall be minimized.  Additional details relative to characterizing coding, modulation, and other signal processing which may be available would be an added plus.<br><br>   f. User Application. The SMS will be operated by Government or contractor personnel that support the OCF's and will include application software to provide a graphical user interface with conventional pull-down menus to enable satellite operational views indicating measured performance, system configuration, troubleshooting, and real time system status.<br><br>   g. Environmental. The SMS will be suitable for fixed facility deployments, where there is minimal environmental hazard exposure. The SMS will operate from worldwide and generator power sources.<br><br>   h. Transportability. The SMS may be transported by air, land, or sea to a staging area during deployments to OCF's worldwide.<br><br>   i. Fully-Automated External Management Interface. The SMS shall interface with operations and management systems that provide an integrated User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to the operator.  As such, the SMS shall provide performance data via an open standards based interface utilizing SNMP, SQL, ODBC, or XML transfers.  The SMS shall compare WGS and DSCS occupancy plan against the SMS measured data and generate alarms to report variances.  The SMS shall display the plan as a spectral mask for easy viewable planned versus measured variances. <br><br>   j. Operator Interface (OI).   User interface shall possess the same features for both local and remote users.  The OI shall contain a dashboard as a simplified starting point for reporting satellite spectrum status.  The OI shall provide a library of spectral and measurement data displays based upon logical groupings.  Individual users should have the ability to customize select displays, as well as have the capability to design and incorporate new custom reports.<br><br>   k. Situational Awareness (SA) via remote access.  Provide access to SMS real-time or near real-time data to remote users that are connected to the OCF global network.  Spectral data must be accessible from several OCF's.  SMS system administrators shall have the ability to restrict remote users to read-only basis.<br>  <br>   l. Component status.  Status of SMS components shall be provided via an SNMP v3 interface.<br><br>3. Future Desired Upgrades:<br><br>   a. Expanded in-beam monitoring capability.  Have the ability to provide 500MHz of instantaneous bandwidth capture.<br><br>   b. Link Performance Monitoring. Add the ability of the SMS to characterize link performance and provide power adjustments in an automated fashion to terminal transmitters.<br><br>4. Services<br><br>   The applicable services to be provided in conjunction with the SMS include: system development as needed; system integration; verification and acceptance testing; information assurance in accordance with DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) regulations and DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs); fully releasable training materials and training support; operations and maintenance support; management and administrative support; integrated logistics support; telecommunications security; engineering; configuration management; site surveys; system and facility installation; facilities, terminals, and support equipment.  Restrictive or recurring licensing costs are not desired.  A minimum of Government Purpose Rights are required for Government and Government support contractor for SMS operations, maintenance, IA management, access to system documentation, including training materials. <br><br>5. Information Requested<br><br>   Interested companies should furnish the following information: <br><br>   a. Name and address of your company.<br><br>   b. Point of Contact (Name address, phone number, and e-mail).<br><br>   c. Identify current products your company offers which most closely match the capabilities specified above.<br><br>   d.

The F6B robots are the only OPNAV approved J04 EOD Table Of Allowance (TOA) robots available that are compatible with existing MK-3 Andros robots currently on hand at EODESU ONE.
  The command currently has MK-3 Andros robots.  The F6B robots grant 19 different position presets, allowing the robot operator to rapidly manipulate the robot into required positions with the single press of a button, greatly reducing the time required to accomplish render safe procedures.  Upgraded camera systems give the team the ability to operate in low-light and no-light conditions, as well as more accurately gather intelligence from IEDs prior to performing render safe procedures.  All other robots do not use technology that interfaces with the robots currently on hand.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, and in conjunction with the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expeditionary Support Unit Ones standardization program, only this specific make and model of technical equipment will satisfy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expeditionary Support Unit Ones need for additional robots or replacement items.
  Only one source is available to provide the requested robots.  The robots are commercial items.  Commercial procedures as outlined in FAR 12 and 13.5 are applicable.  This notice constitutes a Request for Quotations.  No other solicitation will be issued.  The closing time and date is 12:00 P.M. (PST), Tuesday, 28 June 2011.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Other brand names are not sought because any deviation from this brand name manufacturer would cost the Navy substantial amount of money in converting existing systems, not to mention the additional cost to re- training thousands of sailors on a new system.
  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and will be advised as to how to submit their product(s) for future evaluation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received by the closing date of the Request for Quotation set forth above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Point of Contact is Charles (Fletch) Fletcher II at phone number (619) 532-2658, fax number (619) 532-1088 or e-mail charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil.

This material is certified by law under The United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Part 58 - Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies.  The only way to ensure the consistency and scientific merit of the GLP research results is to eliminate variables, and for the animal feed to be provided by the current source.  Minute differences in animal feed types occur between sources, those small differences between vendors are enough to compromise science.  Therefore, the current source must provide all animal feed throughout USAMRIID. <br>The specific items numbers for this contract will include: 2018C, 2019C, 7022 NIH-07, 2040S, 7006, 7006C, 2050, 8630, 8630C, 879N, 2072. <br>All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable animal feed can be  provided by Harlan Laboratories. Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Kimberly Hannan at, Kimberly.S.Hannan@us.army.mil.Statements are due no later than 1:00 P.M. EST on 1 July 2011. No telephone calls will be accepted.<br>

<DESC>DESC: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO Pacific Bell Telephone Company to provide measured assured PBX trunking UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.

Name of Contractor: Pacific Bell Telephone Company

Address of Contractor: 759 Folsom Rm 504, San Francisco, CA 94107-4423.

Approximate Dollar Value of Award: The value of the proposed contract is expected to be under $7,000.00.

Description of Service: Telephone Division has established with the Local Exchange Carrier PBX trunking for the northern area organizational units, tenants and base housing areas, because San Onofre and San Clemente have a different North American Numbering Plan (NANP) of 949-XXX-XXXX, rather than a local NANP of 760-XXX-XXXX for MCB Camp Pendleton.
 The PBX trunking allows for local dialing back into MCB Camp Pendleton without long distance charges incurred to the subscriber(s). The PBX trunk has one pilot access number (949-498-0100), five outgoing lines (949-498-7011, 949-498-7012, 949-498-7013, 949-498-7014, 949-498-7015), four two-way lines (949-498-0100, 949-498-0101, 949-498-0102, 949-498-0103) and one incoming line (949-498-7010) all located in the San Onofre Remote Switching Facility at Building 52410. There are four Business Telephone Lines setup to provide inter-trunking to the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) for out dialing and testing purposes (760-385-4194, 760-385-9639, 760-385-9657 and 760-385-0753) through the Central Telephone Office, Building 2459.

This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.
 No telephone inquiries will be accepted. No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice. 

Solicitation M00681-11-T-0134 applies to this procurement. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities to provide the supplies sought including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the government is available.

The Government will be the sole determiner regarding an offerors ability to meet all requirements. 

The government will consider all EOIs received prior to 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis before 1200 PST on that date.
 A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

EOIs sent via the U.S. Postal Service should be mailed to: Regional Contracting Office, MCI-West, 
Attn: Sergeant Torey J. Fezer, P.O. Box 1609, Oceanside, CA 92051-1609.

<p>Provision Addendum:<br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>A. Technical - (acceptable/unacceptable): All offers received will be reviewed/evaluated for:<br />1. Ability to meet the requirements of the attached specifications<br />2. Demonstration of capability<br />3. Demonstration of technical responsibility</p>
<p>B. Price - All quotes determined to be technically acceptable will then be ranked according to price. The lowest- priced of the technically acceptable offers will be deemed the successful offer and award will be made to that offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination.</p>

An offer/proposal rated unacceptable will not be considered for award and will not be evaluated further. Technical acceptability is determined on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Demonstration of Technical Responsibility: The standard is met when the offeror clearly demonstrates that they are a member of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), can provide direct manufacturer support and shall directly issue a manufacturer's limited factory warranty to the Government.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

See attached matrix1.   INTRODUCTION:Under the provisions of P.L. 107-110 "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB) and the Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Department of Education the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) is designated as the State Educational Agency (SEA) for 184 instructional and residential programs in 23 states that receive funding under NCLB.  The BIE provides over-site and supervision for schools that are funded under P.L. 95-561 that are operated by the BIE and for tribally operated schools that are funded under the provisions of P.L. 100-297 and P.L. 93-638 that receive funding under NCLB.  100% of the students that attend BIE operated and funded programs meet the criterion for being socially and economically disadvantaged which qualifies these schools to receive funding under Title I NCLB.As the SEA for these schools the BIE assumes the responsibility for the appropriate use of funds and that school meet the accountability requirements and adhere to the process for determining Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for the respective state the school is located in.  2.   BACKGROUND:As NCLB funding is supplemental funding to support the needs of these student populations, the BIE must also monitor schools to ensure that instructional programs are aligned with state standards and that funding is used to supplement the base program at the school and not supplant the school's base operation which is funded under the Indian Student Equalization Program (ISEP) referred to as "accountability." Contained in the SEA responsibilities to BIE funded and operated schools is the need to provide technical assistants, monitoring,  and training for the implementation of programs that address requirements contained in the NCLB.3.   SCOPEBIE must comply with the accountability requirements of P.L. 107-110 "No Child Left Behind" and requires the assistance of a contractor to perform desk monitoring and verification audits, and provide technical advice on corrective action plans regarding program implementation for Bureau funded and operated schools, residential programs, and Education Line Offices.  The monitoring and evaluation of school programs is a legal general supervision responsibility of P.L. 93-638, P.L. 107-110, P.L. 95-561, and NCLB.  The contractor shall monitor 38 BIE funded or operated schools per year under the requirements of NCLB.  Schools that are in AYP status will be required to only complete a Desk Monitoring (see Definitions).  A site verification visit will not be conducted at these schools except upon request of the Education Line Officer, the School Administrator, or the Tribal government if the school is a 100-297 or 93-638 school.  All schools not in AYP status require Desk Monitoring and Site Verification services.  4.   CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIESThe contractor is responsible for furnishing all equipment, connectivity, supplies, travel, transportation of goods or equipments, or additional professional services needed to carry out the requirements of the solicitation00.See Attached RFQ

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Dressing Sponges. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is July 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619)532-8537; Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Dressing Sponges. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $3,038,581. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top forty-nine (49) line items of the total one hundred twenty-four (124) line items, account for 83.89% ($2,549,071) of the total volume in sales ($3,038,581) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 8 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr.@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement:<br /><br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Dressing Sponges products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for sterile and non-sterile, woven, and latex free Dressing Sponges in a variety of materials and widths as follows: <br />a.<br />GAUZE SPONGE, 8X4 12PLY BULK NONSTERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 4X4IN 8PLY NON-STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 4X4IN 12PLY STERILE<br />COVER SPONGE, RAYON/CELLULOSE, PEEL-BACK PKG, 4" X 4", STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 2X2IN 8PLY STERILE<br />GAUZE SPONGE, DRESSING, 2X2IN 12PLY NON-STERILE LATEX-FREE<br />SPONGE FLUFF MEDIUM 6X6 3/4IN DIAG <br />3" X 8", FINE MESH, STERILE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Dressing Sponges.</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. A vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (A vendor who does not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Dressing Sponges product line. Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. A vendor without a DAPA number or who has not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Dressing Sponges or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. A vendor whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who has not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />(Note: vendor who fails to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative). Vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</span></strong> <strong>Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples.</strong> This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) packs of each type and size listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation. <br />Gauze Sponge Dressing, 4X4IN 8PLY Non-Sterile<br />Gauze Sponge Dressing, 2X2IN 8PLY Sterile <br />Gauze Sponge Dressing 4X4IN 12PLY Sterile <br />Cover Sponge, Rayon/Cellulose, Peel-Pack4X4 Sterile <br />Sponge Fluff Medium 6X6 3/4IN Diagnostic<br />3" X 8" Fine Mesh, Sterile<br />The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Dressing Sponge product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) - Completely Unacceptable, two (2) - Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) - Partially Unacceptable, four (4) - Acceptable, and five (5) - Highly Acceptable. The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be seventeen (17) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The dressing sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01) The weave and composition of the dressing sponge must remain securely intact. The release of woven material fragments can contribute to the formation of granulomas and/or act as a foreign body which may contribute to a Hospital Acquired Surgical Site infection.<br />2. The dressing sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01) Product should be soft and absorbable reducing risk of tissue damage to patient. Abrasive materials can damage the skin and internal tissues and contribute to bleeding, abrade tissue and cause harm to surrounding tissue which results in an inflammatory response to the tissue damage.<br />3. The dressing sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01) Product will have woven material which will maintain its shape and required construction. Sponges which do not retain durability and fray can be harmful to the tissue.<br />4. The packaging must be constructed allowing for immediate sterile opening during sterile procedure and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage) Package edges should separate easily and evenly. Packaging/containers which open unevenly can deliver a contaminated sponge to a sterile field.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>Statement of Work for SPIDERS Mobile Access Application
<p>1.0 Background<br />The mission of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Industrial Base Program (IBP) is to ensure fulfillment of wartime requirements by maintaining a strong national and global industrial base. The Subsistence IBP team manages that goal by leveraging SPIDERS, a web-based tool designed to oversee the ability of commercial industry to meet the warfighters' demands in surge.</p>
<p>2.0 Objective and Scope<br />The intent of this solicitation is to explore the feasibility of a SPIDERS application designed for use on a personal digital assistant (i.e. Blackberry PDA) or personal computer (PC) that is not enabled by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate or Common Access Card (CAC).</p>
<p>Since SPIDERS serves as a data integration platform for mission tracking and industrial base extension data which is used to assist in readiness planning, the data is proprietary and secured through use of a PKI certificate or CAC. This security presents a problem in two instances; vendors without a PKI certificate are unable to access, which results in aging data. Secondly, industrial base specialists performing site visits remotely at vendor facilities are unable to record data in real time. They must manually record data obtained during these site visits and manually load this information into SPIDERS.<br /><br />3.0 Purpose<br />SPIDERS is a self-service tool for all stakeholders, including customers and vendors. While it boasts secure and centralized access to subsistence readiness information, its security limits data collection. The development of a PDA application to record vendor production capability would further enable efficient sharing of information. IB specialists could record data offsite, and vendors could update production capabilities more frequently. <br />In addition to production capability functionality, the possibility of a surge test module should be explored. Similar to the inability to access SPIDERS remotely to record production capability, a mobile application to run surge scenarios would be of great benefit. Operating this through an application, would not require the level of reporting that is currently output with the surge test module in SPIDERS. This application would have applicability to not only the IBP team, but the entire DLA enterprise.<br />The data entered into this mobile application would not touch SPIDERS; the form data would only achieve visibility in SPIDERS after receiving approval from the Subsistence Chief, Industrial Base Planning or other appointed supervisory personnel.</p>
<p>4.0 Response Requirements<br />DLA Troop Support IBP requests a brief proposal detailing a possible resolution to this SOW. Specifically, identify hardware and software requirements and associated costs to support this initiative. The application will ideally be compatible with a PC, as well as a Blackberry platform PDA. Other PDA platforms may be explored at a later time.</p>
<p>5.0 Budget &amp; Deliverables<br />DLA Troop Support IBP will operate this effort on a $20,000 budget. Vendor will invoice on a time and materials basis. <br />Progress reports will be provided weekly to the contracting officer, Pete LaVerghetta as well as the Chief, Subsistence Industrial Base Planning. <br />Initial proposal will include a timeline for completion of the project.<br />Deliverables will include a mock-up of the web form or template.<br />Invoice shall be submitted monthly and must include a detailed breakdown of tasks performed, personnel and hours worked and supplies and equipment used.</p>
<p>6.0 Evaluation Factors<br />DLA Troop Support IBP will evaluate responses based upon the following: <br />&#61607; Evidence of successful past performance based on similar data gathering work. References provided will be taken into account.<br />&#61607; Specifics on key personnel that will be supporting the proposed agreement. We will evaluate personnel experience in carrying out similar data requests; individual success will be taken into account in order to determine the anticipated success of the firm in providing this service to DLA Troop Support IBP.<br />&#61607; Estimated timeframe to complete this tasking bearing in mind that any follow-on funds will be fiscal year sensitive.<br />DLA Troop Support IBP will evaluate criteria based on order of importance at the factor level. The government will make a risk assessment based upon information provided in the submittal, to include sources derived from outside the submittal. This risk assessment will be evaluated in the rating for any factors and/or sub factors that place the government at risk. Technical factors, when combined, are weighted more heavily than price. As technical factors become equivalent, price, and your commitment to customer satisfaction, become more critical.</p>

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 

*This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored. 

Questions regarding postponement:
GSA Contact: Alan Rosner, 212-264-0868
E-mail: smartshop@gsa.gov

Solicitation 2FYB-BU-050001-B is a Worldwide Federal Supply Schedule. The offering of office products/supplies and services listed in the firms commercial office supply catalog are acceptable. Offerors may offer their entire commercial catalog, or may offer a select, limited line of office products.

Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a performance period of 5 years with options to renew for up to 3 additional 5-year periods. Offerors must register at www.ccr.gov and orca.bpn.gov prior to award of any contract. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by another refreshed solicitation.

<DESC>It is common today for even consumer-grade cameras to tag the images and videos that they capture with the location of the image on the earth's surface ("geolocation").  However, some imagery does not a geolocation tag, and it can be important to know the location of the camera, image, or objects in the scene.  For this imagery, analysts work hard to deduce as much as they can using reference data from many sources, including overhead and ground-based images, digital elevation data, existing well-understood image collections, surface geology, geography, and cultural information.  Such image/video geolocation is an extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive activity that often meets with limited success.<br /><br />Several research and consumer-oriented systems have developed useful and relevant capabilities using techniques that include large-scale ground-level image acquisition, crowd sourcing, and sophisticated image matching.  These largely automated systems tend to work best in geographic areas with significant population densities or that are well traveled by tourists, and where the query image or video contains notable features such as mountains or buildings.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Finder Program aims to build on existing research systems to develop technology that augments the analyst's abilities to address the geolocation task.  Required technical innovations include the 1) integration of analysts' abilities and automated geolocation technologies to solve geolocation problems, 2) fusion of diverse, publicly-available, but often imperfect data sources, and 3) expansion of automated geolocation technologies to work efficiently and accurately over all terrain and large search areas.  If successful, Finder will deliver rigorously tested solutions for the image/video geolocation task of any outdoor terrestrial location.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Contract/Program Office will evaluate the offerors proposed solution and approach for meeting or exceeding the requirements based on the following considerations: Technical Approach, Proposed Personnel, Past Performance, and Price. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation to the responsible and technically acceptable Offeror whose proposal provides the greatest overall value to the Government. This best value determination will be accomplished by comparing the differences in the technical factors for competing offers, based on their strengths, weaknesses, and risks, with differences in their price to the Government. In making this comparison, the Contract/Program Office is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and personnel capabilities than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government.

(1) Technical Approach:  Ability to meet technical qualifications.

Price reasonableness will be established by competition and determined primarily by comparison with other offers submitted. The proposed cost/prices will also be compared to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).

The Privacy Act is applicable to this requirement.

Quotations are to be sent electronically to larochek@mail.nih.gov.  

The Period of Performance is 12 months with three 12-month Option Year periods.

<p>NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Positioning System Replacement Statement of Work</strong></p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown is currently outfitted with a Simrad Roberston dynamic positioning system (DPS), installed when the vessel was built in 1997. Vessel power is provided by two, LIPS azimuthing stern thrusters and one, Elliott White Gill bow thruster. These thrusters have been unchanged since vessel delivery and their existing propulsion characteristics shall be used as inputs for the new DPS. The existing system provides four (4) local control locations. The new system shall provide three (3) local control stations, all on the Bridge; locations shall be: the center console control station, the port bridge wing control station, and the starboard bridge wing control station.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1. The DPS provided by the vendor shall be their most recent, fixed, model-based system currently in production that has been fully tested and installed on a minimum of 10 vessels having ship characteristics equivalent to, or greater than, those of NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown, and having the same general propulsion configuration, that is, two azimuthing thrusters fixed to the underside of the vessel at the stern, and a minimum of one bow thruster. The system delivered to these vessels shall have received a DPS-1 (or better) ABS class notation.</p>
<p>NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN Characteristics:</p>
<p>Length Overall 274 feet - 0 inches.<br />Beam (Moulded) 52 feet - 6 inches.<br />Draft (Navigational) 19 feet - 0 inches.<br />Displacement (FL) 3250 LT<br />Displacement (LS) 2100 LT<br />Gross Tonnage 3180 G.T.<br />Propulsion Z- Drives: 2<br />Bow Thruster: 1<br />Speed Sustained: 12 knots</p>
<p>2. The DPS shall be designed to meet all requirements of American Bureau Shipping (ABS) Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels, 2010, Part 4, Chapter 3, Section 5, "Thrusters and Dynamic Positioning Systems" The vendor's price shall include all costs associated with submitting documentation required to American Bureau of Shipping in order that an (ABS) DPS-1 class notation is assigned to the DPS.</p>
<p>3. The DPS shall be delivered with a built-in, fully functional autopilot, approved by ABS as a heading control system.</p>
<p>4. Vendor shall provide a minimum of 40 hours hands- on and theoretical training for 6 members of the bridge team at the vendor's training facility. NOAA will provide necessary travel costs for all attendees.</p>
<p>5. System Warranty. The warranty period shall commence with a written document that establishes a specific System Commissioning date. The System Commissioning date shall be after a successful testing and acceptance sea trial and after the date of assignment of ABS DPS-1 class notation. The basic warranty period shall be for a minimum of one year from the System Commissioning date and include unlimited remote technical assistance for tuning the system and setting or modifying system parameters. During the basic warranty period, technical support shall include site visits by the vendor if required to correct problems, repair or replace defective items, and bring the system to a satisfactory operating status. The vendor's responsibility for travel costs shall be based on travel from vendor's facility to Charleston, SC.</p>
<p>6. Vendor shall include the cost of a testing and acceptance sea-trial, with both ABS and the vendor in attendance. Sea trial shall be to the satisfaction of the attending surveyor such that an ABS DPS-1 class notation for the DPS is issued. Government shall pay for the services of ABS surveyor for a one-time sea trial, however should a subsequent sea trial be required due to a vendor-responsible problem with the DPS, then the vendor shall be responsible for any additional ABS costs. The Government is not responsible for any vendor costs associated with additional sea trial(s) For estimating purposes, sea trial will be held in Charleston, SC.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting requirements for DPS-1 class notation, the following work shall be accomplished during the sea trial:<br />a. Test all inputs/ alarms of the system<br />b. Tune system components and demonstrate all system features<br />c. Test the remote diagnostic feature through an on-board demonstration in which both hardware and software faults are induced, remote satellite communication is established between the vendor and the dynamic positioning system, and the vendor correctly identifies the faults and recommends solutions available for on-board ship's personnel to accomplish.</p>
<p>A minimum of two weeks prior to the sea trial, vendor shall deliver a sea trial "Tuning and Acceptance Test" document to NOAA for review and comment. After agreement of both parties on the format and procedures, a final document shall be delivered to NOAA and to ABS. The document shall describe in detail the tests and procedures to be followed.</p>
<p>7. Spare Parts. Provide a vendor-recommended quantity of basic spare parts for the DPS, to include all fuses, light bulbs, LED's. Spare parts shall also include one CPU for the control computer and one, three-axis joystick, identical to the installed joysticks.</p>
<p>8. System Restoration. Vendor shall provide the system application software on discs, or other media, along with other software as necessary, such that the application software can be loaded onto an on-board laptop computer and downloaded from the laptop to the Programmable Logic Computer (PLC) for system restoration purposes. Download shall be accomplished through Ethernet, or other standard communication protocol. System restoration capability shall be tested and verified by the vendor during the installation contract.</p>
<p>MODES OF OPERATION</p>
<p>At a minimum, the DPS shall provide the following modes of operation:</p>
<p>1. Manual Thruster Control Mode (ABS requirement). The system shall provide a mode selection option to utilize the existing LIPS manual controllers. These controllers provide both azimuth and RPM control for each thruster (2 stern thrusters, one bow thruster).</p>
<p>2. Manual Joystick Mode (ABS requirement). This mode shall permit the user to position the vessel using the joystick. The joystick provided shall have three directions of movement, one for longitudinal movement, one for lateral movement, and one for vessel rotation. When the joystick is in a position that combines all three directions of movement, the vessel movement corresponds to the combined result. The rotation point that the vessel rotates about shall be user selectable (bow, amidships, stern and transit).</p>
<p>Individual thrusters shall be able to be engaged and disengaged in this mode.</p>
<p>3. Autohead Joystick Mode (ABS requirement). In this mode the position is controlled with the joystick in the same way as manual joystick, apart from the vessel's heading which is controlled automatically by the autopilot. The heading reference shall be adjusted using a course selector control. Individual thrusters shall be able to be engaged and disengaged in this mode.</p>
<p>4. Autopilot Mode. Autopilot holds the heading as sensed by the gyrocompass. The autopilot steering system shall have a sensitivity adjustment for heavy weather in the autopilot mode. The autopilot shall automatically control the ship's heading within two degrees for selected course speeds from near zero to maximum. The autopilot mode shall interface with the vessel's Transas<br />ECDIS and Voyage Planning course data. RPM control of the stern thrusters shall be controlled by the LIPS manual controllers.</p>
<p>5. Auto track (Waypoint), Low and High Speed Modes. The DPS shall provide the capability of accepting a minimum of 50 waypoints. Variation of ship's heading from the track course shall be user-selectable up to a limit of plus-or-minimum 45 degrees. When following a multiple waypoint trackline that requires a change in course after a waypoint, the DPS shall change the ship's heading automatically to follow the new course of the next track segment. The DPS shall alert the operator that a turn is impending at a fixed time interval before the turn. The DPS shall alert the operator by alarm when the ship falls off track. Options shall include automatic or manual heading and automatic or manual holding of desired speed.</p>
<p>5. Auto Position (Station Keeping) Mode. Auto position allows the vessel to hold a defined position. The heading in this mode shall be either manually selected by the operator or selected utilizing an optimal heading function. The optimal heading places the vessel's head in the direction which requires the least power to maintain position and heading.</p>
<p>Each of the three individual thrusters shall be able to be engaged and disengaged in this mode as this is a requirement during operations such as deploying and recovering buoys and ROV's.</p>
<p>6. Combination Automatic and Joystick Mode: Allow automatic control in one or two of the surge, sway, yaw axis, with joystick control of the remaining.</p>
<p>7. Minimum Power Mode. Vendors may use alternate terminology for this mode such as Relaxed DP, Relaxed Control, Minimum Overall Thrust, Auto Area Position, Green DP, etc. The DPS shall provide the operator with a choice of fully automatic operation at reduced power and/or response time to maintain position within a user- defined operating area for the purpose of greater fuel reduction along with a reduced and smoother thruster force compared to what would be the "optimum" thruster allocation logic determined by the DP system controller for normal high precision control.</p>
<p>8. Automatic ROV Mode (Target Follow): NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN engages in ROV operations. The DPS shall maintain a fixed station and accept inputs from the ROV control station to adjust the ship's position as needed to follow ROV operations. In this mode the system shall maintain the best heading for ROV operations. Options shall include automatic or manual heading and user determined speed.</p>
<p>9. DPS shall be provided with a Simulation Trainer Mode.</p>
<p>STATIONKEEPING and TRACK LINE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1. Stationkeeping. The DPS shall be capable of keeping station within a watch circle of &plusmn;10 meters in diameter, on best heading, in seas up to 2.5 meters significant wave height, wind speed up to 35 knots and current up to 1 knot, acting simultaneously. Wind and waves shall be considered to act in the same direction. The requirement shall be met with the angle between current direction and wind/ wave direction from zero to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>2. High Speed Track Line Operations. DPS shall be capable of automatically maintaining track within a track error of 10 meters either side of the track, while performing hydro-acoustic surveys at speeds up to 12 knots, in seas up to 2.5 meters significant wave height, 1 knot current and 35 knot winds, for all environmental angles between zero and 180 degrees, port or starboard.</p>
<p>3. Low Speed Track Line Operations. DPS shall be capable of automatically maintaining a track line within 10 meters with no restriction on crab angle at a speed of near zero knots, with a towing resistance of 18 kN, in seas up to 2.5 meters significant wave height, 1 knot current and 35 knot winds, for all environmental angles between 0 and 180 degrees, port and starboard.</p>

The range area shall possess a cleaning area complete with air hose and solvent tank.</p>
<p>DHS will use the range an average of 64 days annually with approximately 200,000 rounds to be shot annually.

<p>COCO Alert 08-33 Attachment 1, Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard (USCG) vessels require updated electronic charts in ELECTRONIC NAUTICAL CHARTS (ENC) and RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS (RNC) format for their areas of operation, which includes U.S., Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean waters, as well as select other areas. Most electronic navigational charts for the U.S. waters are available from the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Association (NOAA), National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Charts for non-U.S. waters will need to be acquired from or produced on the authority of various International Hydrographic Offices. To support this requirement, the Coast Guard is seeking a contract for the continued monthly distribution of updated charts for these geographic areas, delivered on CD-ROM at set intervals and times, to USCG vessels for use with their navigation systems. The Coast Guard's goal is to ensure that USCG vessels are provided with the most current and up-to-date electronic navigational charts available. By utilizing the services of a commercial contractor who is familiar with both International and United States electronic charting standards, the Coast Guard believes it can more effectively and efficiently provide updated navigational charts to USCG vessels and overcome inconsistencies that can occur from the constant changing of personnel and the broad range of computer skills.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) seeks experienced Program Managers with a track record of success managing democracy or related programs. The position will support the Cuban Affairs Office in the Latin America and Caribbean Bureau (LAC). Cuba is a "non-presence" country, which means that USAID does not have an in-country office and programs are managed from Washington. The Program Manager will support procurement planning activities, program design, implementation, budgeting, monitoring and reporting of a portfolio of programs for USAID's program in Cuba. S/he will be an integral member of the Cuban Affairs Office team working within a unique closed-society context. The high-visibility and political priority associated with the Cuba Affairs Office place special responsibilities on all office personnel.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract. The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC. The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.<br />(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned. The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The contractor will provide support to develop detailed requirements for a distribution solution to deliver approved Electronic Technical Orders to Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Partners via a secure web interface. Requirement will include both written and visual documentation. After a detailed project plan is completed and coordinated, contractor will support the development and implementation to satisfy requirements for FMS Electronic Technical Order (eTO) Distribution Solution and acceptance testing.

Please indicate revenue relative to the standard of $7,000,000</strong>. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DOD contract. No set-aside decision has been made.

Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</p>
<p>Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit packages that outline their capability to provide the required service.

Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar projects within the past three (3) years. Interested firms may submit resumes of key personnel. Resume pages will NOT be considered part of the overall page count but firms are encouraged to keep submitted resumes to one page each. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 15 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Michael Jones at Michael.Jones@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

Pursuant to this clarification, the response date has been changed to 28 June 2011 1500 Local Time.</strong></p>

<DESC>Solicitation W44W9M-11-T-0174 Questions<br><br>1.	Line 2, please explain the need for a Quick Change laser on Line 2?   Are you planning to switch from a 20W CO2 laser to 30W CO2 laser?<br>	The "Quick Change" laser is a feature of the Versa Laser Platform that allows easy replacement of the laser cartridge without alignment.  The 30W laser cartridge is the requested laser to be installed.  There will not be a need to switch to the 20W.  <br>2.	Will the laser be secured in a stationary location, or is it intended for the entire system (including vacuum exhaust) to be capable of being mobile to move from room to room?<br>	The laser will need to be capable of being mobile to move from room to room.<br>3.	Line 3, please describe your intended use for the "Optic Collimator"?  <br>	The Optic Collimator is an accessory required by the Versa Laser Platform.<br>4.	What materials will be marked with the laser?  Aluminum, Anodized Aluminum, Polyacrylic (TESA), Other?	<br><br>Aluminum and Anodized Aluminum will be the main materials.<br><br>5.	What are the throughput requirements per/hr or per/day<br>	There is not a throughput requirement.  The unit will be used on an occasional basis for 1-5 tags.<br>6.	Will Cermark or any other topcoat laser bonding materials be used to mark materials with this system?<br>	No<br>7.	On Line 7, the specification calls out a Motorola MC9190G Unit w/3D scanner.    Our information indicates that this unit has 1D/2D scanner capability, but not 3D.  Please advise is this is a typo, or other?<br><br>Line 7 lists it as "MOTOROLA MC9190G UNIT WITH 2D SCANNER".  We use 2D dot matrix codes (ECC-200) which can be read by the Motorola MC9190-G.  <br><br>8.	Line 8, please describe and explain what is meant by the term "Application Generator"?  What is the definition of this?  Please offer its intended use within the system configuration.<br>	The smart scanners require Application Generator software be used to setup the scanners for the particular purpose.  This line item covers that software, which can be used for all 4 scanner units.<br>9.	Line 9, please explain "Professional Development Services".   What will these be used for?  Please specify what project or program these Professional Services will be dedicated to.  How many hours, objectives, etc.<br>	The Professional Development Services is the programming using the Application Generator Software to setup the scanners for our particular use.  It is estimated to require 16 hours to complete this task.<br>10.	Where will the "Application Generator", and "Professional Development Services" take place?  What is the deliverable expected from these requirements? <br>	Since the Application Generator is software as described under question 8, the Professional Development Services is the only item in question here.  The Professional Development Services can take place at the vendors chosen location to include preliminary setup.  Final setup and configuration will probably be required at the installation location. The extent of this will depend on the amount of preliminary setup done by the vendor.   In total the estimated amount of time required is still the 16 hours stated in question 9. <br>11.	How will the IUID data be submit to the IUID Registry?<br>	It will not.<br>12.	Will there be embedded items using Parent/Child configuration as part of this system?<br>	No <br>13.	Will there be a need for capturing UID Mark data from items already having a UID mark on them?<br>	No<br>14.	Will there be a need to communicate data with Wide Area Work Flow, IUID Registry or both?<br>	No<br>15.	How will data be supplied to the system in order to create the UID Mark?<br><br>The data will be entered into a "setup" screen by the operator.<br><br>16.	Page 9 of solicitation, please clarify what the meaning of the sentence "LOWEST PRICE RESPONSIBLE OFFER.  Technical & past performance, when combined, are none" this means the award will be made to the lowest price responsible offer.<br><br><br>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<br><br>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Army's LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<br><br>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<br><br>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Army's LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<br><br>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<br><br>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Army's Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <br><br>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<br>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Army's current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to 'Additional Info' located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text "LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents".                                                                                                                       <br>(Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm) <br><br>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<br><br>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <br><br>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Army's LNA Compliance requirements. <br><br>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<br><br>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendor's assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendor's certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<br><br>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<br><br>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<br><br>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <br><br><br>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

Description of Amendment:
Pre-Solicitation Notice # L11PS00272 is hereby amended as follows:

<DESC><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded a Firm-Fixed Priced, Time and Material contract to El Dorado Mobile Home in support of FEMA's Individual Assistance Program for the Hauling and Installing of Mobile Homes. This requirement was competed among small businesses residing or primarily doing business in the State of Arkansas in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.</p>
<p>A hybrid contract (FFP and T&amp;M) was utilized because it is not possible to accurately estimate the distance or how many units will be needed to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence IAW FAR 16.601(c), as the place of performance for this requirement is in various counties within the State of Arkansas.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Overland Corporation, W9126G-08-D-0083, DS01, Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC)<br><br>As part of Operations and Maintenance, Army, Recovery Act, this modification has been issued to Overland Corporation, to perform the following work:  (1) Canton Cable Barrier:  The Phase 3 design called for approximately 5,125 LF of guardrail on Thunder Road at Canton to replace substandard rail on both sides of the road.  The existing roadway width is only 24 FT.  Guardrail installation per ODOT Standards requires 1 FT clear space outside the back of guardrail post, an 8 inch post, 8 inch block out, and 3 inch rail element. The resulting driving width for two way traffic after guardrail installation to Oklahoma Department of Transporation Standards would only be 19 FT, and would be too narrow to accommodate two way traffic.  Therefore cable barrier substitution was proposed in lieu of guardrail, and any cost savings would be applied to replacement cable barrier parts and training.  (2) Broken Bow Electric Conduit:  The Phase 3 design calle for an existing high voltage line that was attached to existing guardrail to be removed from the guardrail and buried under ground.  When the contractor for the guardrail contract arrived on site at Broken Bow, another contractor had already performed the work under a different contract.  It was therefore decided install additional needed guardrail in lieu of the conduit work.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12 Great Lakes Acquisition Center, William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital, 2500 Overlook Terrace, Madison, Wisconsin.  This is a Justification for Other Than Full an Open Competition.  The purchase request number is 607-11-3-5123-0023.

2.  Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Justification and approval for a new contract for the Medical Transcription services on a sole source basis to Upper Peninsula Medical Transcription (UPMT), Inc., which is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB).  Award will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.
  
3.  Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  VA Madison has a requirement for Medical Transcription services.  The estimated value of the procurement is $351,440 for a base and one year.  The estimated period of performance is July 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. 

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  38 U.S.C. 8127(c), PL 109-461 is the specific statute that allows Sole Source SDVOSB contracting.

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  VA Madison does not have VA employees who are capable of performing medical transcription services.  VA Madison needs to have a new contract in place by July 1, 2011.  The UPMT is a SDVOSB and they currently have a contract to perform similar medical transcription services for the Federal Health Care Facility (FHCC), formally known as VA North Chicago.  UPMT is registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database (VAAR 819.7007).  The FHCC and VA Madison currently use the same VA dictation system located at VA Iron Mountain.  All of the UPMT medical transcriptionists already have VPN access and extensive knowledge of working with the dictation system.  They upload their own transcription reports directly into Vista through a Vista telnet application.  UPMT's error rate for uploading is almost nil due to the transcriptionist uploading their own reports.  Another advantage is that the medical transcriptionists have already had NACI background investigations done and have taken the 2011 VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training.  Due to the short timeline, it is in the best interest to sole source this procurement to a SDVOSB who has the extensive experience and background to meet the needs of VA Madison. 

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable:  A FedBizOps (FBO) notice will be posted and any interested sources may be considered.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Pricing offered will be compared to the government estimate, market research, and prior contracts for the same service prior to award.

8.  Determination of the Market Survey Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was conducted.  A SBA Small Dynamic Business search utilizing NAICS code 561410 revealed 646 SDVOSB who could potentially perform these services.  A VetBiz Registry search utilizing NAICS code 561410 revealed 400 SDVOSB who could potentially perform these services.  

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11.  A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:  The GLAC intends to do a competitive VISN-wide Medical Transcription contract upon expiration of the current contracts for the other VISN VA Hospitals.

12.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veteran Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
