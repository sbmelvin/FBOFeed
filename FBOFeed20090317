We have an urgent and compelling need to contract for services due to adverse affects caused by the delay in processing applications for land into trust.   Any delay will ultimately cause additional financial burden through additional taxes and fees being imposed upon the tribe(s).  Additionally, it would hinder progress for planning in housing and other development projects that are essential to the Tribe and the Indian people we serve.
Currently staffing shortages limit our ability to effectively manage the heavy caseload.  LaPointe Industries is a small, Native American and woman owned business.  Rosalyn Lapointe, sole proprietor has 25 years of Federal Government experience in the real estate field.  She has knowledge, skills and abilities, with special emphasis in processing land into trust applications.  She helped develop the 2008 Fee to Trust Handbook, which stipulates the application process and is based on the regulations found at 25 CFR Part 151.  This person is uniquely qualified to perform the required duties with minimal direction and supervision.  This wil be a short-term (60 day) contract for services to fill in until federal employees can be hired and trained.

    evidence prior to award to establish the
    identity of the item and its manufacturing
    source.  Failure to provide any required
    documentation within the stated timeframe may
    result in rejection of the offer.

    Traceability documentation must, at a minimum,
    include the following:

    dealer/distributorship agreement, a letter of
    authorization from the approved/qualified
    source, or a link to the approved/qualified
    source's website which clearly identifies the
    offeror as an authorized dealer/distributor.

    (b) By providing this documentation, the offeror
    represents that the dealer/distributor
    relationship with the approved/qualified source
    applies to the  item being procured. If the
    offeror's dealer/distributor status with the
    approved/qualified source changes either before
    or after award, the offeror will promptly notify
    the contracting officer.

    (2)If the offeror is not an authorized
    dealer/distributor for an approved/qualified
    source the offeror must provide the following:

    to the offeror.  The quote must include the
    approved/qualified source's part number (or Mil
    Spec Type Designation), quantity sufficient to
    satisfy the solicitation requirement and date of
    quotation.  The quotation must either be on
    letter head from the approved/qualified source
    or an authorized dealer distributor to the
    offeror, or an electronic quote clearly
    identifiable as coming from the
    approved/qualified source or authorized
    dealer/distributor to the offeror.  If the
    products will be obtained from an authorized
    dealer/distributor, the information described in
    (1) must be provided to establish the authorized

    offeror.  The document must be dated and include
    the following elements:  name and address of the
    approved/qualified source; the
    approved/qualified part number (or Mil Spec Type
    Designation); quantity sufficient to satisfy the

    and address.  If the products were obtained from
    an authorized dealer/distributor, the

    Hybrid Microcircuits, and Semiconductor Devices.


    (3) If the products to be furnished are not
    obtained directly from an approved/qualified
    source or an authorized dealer/distributor of an
    approved/qualified source, the offeror must
    provide the documentation described in (2)
    establishing the complete line of ownership or
    distribution from the approved/qualified source
    or an authorized dealer/distributor to the

    to contract award, the Government reserves the
    right to require additional documentation
    attesting to the authenticity of the material at
    any time before or after contract delivery.

    reserves the right to change to Inspection and
    Acceptance at Origin at time of award, and to
    incorporate DLAD clause 52.246-9004, Product

REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTERESTLONG-TERM MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY
I.  OBJECTIVE OF THE REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED.  
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking Expressions of Interest from the private sector regarding potential locations for a facility or facilities where DOE can store and manage elemental mercury pursuant to the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (the Act).  The Act directs DOE to designate by January 1, 2010, a facility or facilities of DOE for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury.  At least one such facility must be operational by January 1, 2013.
DOE intends to initiate an Environmental Impact Statement in early 2009 and seeks to identify facilities to consider as potential alternatives.  Accordingly, respondents to this Request for Expressions of Interest may have the facilities they identify considered during the environmental review scoping process.  The environmental review will also analyze the potential environmental impacts of storing elemental mercury at one or more DOE or other Federal facilities.
This Request for Expressions of Interest is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals.
II.  GENERAL INFORMATION
The Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States effective January 1, 2013.  To ensure that elemental mercury is managed and stored safely, the Act directs DOE to take a number of actions.  By October 1, 2009, DOE must issue guidance establishing standards and procedures for the receipt, management and long-term storage of elemental mercury generated within the United States at a facility or facilities of DOE.  DOE must designate such facilities by January 1, 2010, but is prohibited by the Act from locating such a facility at DOE's Oak Ridge Reservation.  At least one such facility must be operational by January 1, 2013.  
In addition to the standards and procedures referenced above, elemental mercury managed and stored at a designated facility will be subject to the requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), 42 U.S.C. ? 6901 et seq.  A designated facility in existence on or before January 1, 2013, is authorized to operate under interim status pursuant to RCRA section 3005(e), 42 U.S.C. ? 6925(e), until a final decision on a permit application is made pursuant to RCRA section 3005(c), 42 U.S.C. ? 6925(c).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or an authorized State, shall issue a final decision on the permit application by January 1, 2015.
Currently elemental mercury in the United States comes from several sources, including mercury used in the chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing process, mercury reclaimed from recycling and waste recovery activities, and mercury generated as a byproduct of the gold mining process.  In a November 2007 "Mercury Storage Costs Estimates" report, EPA assumed the total amount of excess mercury supply from commercial sources that would require storage to be between 7,500 and 10,000 metric tons over 40 years.  The 7,500 metric ton scenario assumes that approximately 1,200 metric tons would come from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants, approximately 2,050 metric tons would come from product recycling and waste recovery, and approximately 4,250 metric tons would be a byproduct of gold mining.  The 10,000 metric ton scenario assumes that an additional 2,500 metric tons would result from imports.  There are uncertainties associated with these estimates, and DOE anticipates updating thes e estimates in conjunction with its activities to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
In addition, DOE currently stores approximately 1,200 metric tons of elemental mercury at its Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee.  Also, the Department of Defense (DOD) stores approximately 4,400 metric tons at various locations.  At this time, no decision has been made as to how much elemental mercury from DOE or DOD would be stored in the DOE-designated facilities required by the Act.
As required by Council on Environmental Quality and DOE NEPA regulations, DOE's designation of facilities for the purpose of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury generated in the United States must include consideration of the range of reasonable management and storage alternatives and the environmental impacts of those alternatives.  The purpose of this Request is to determine if there is interest on the part of commercial entities in proposing locations for long-term DOE management and storage facilities.  Identification of such facilities will enable DOE to consider them for potential inclusion in its NEPA review.
Consideration of a facility in the environmental review process is not a guarantee of its selection.  Proposed sites and facilities will be reviewed against a series of technical screening criteria to consider their suitability for a long-term elemental mercury management and storage mission.  In addition, in accordance with NEPA implementing regulations, DOE will conduct public outreach, such as a scoping meeting or meetings, for those sites and facilities considered to be reasonable alternatives, to allow the public to comment.
III.  REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST: 
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED.  
DOE intends to consider a range of reasonable alternatives, including existing and new DOE facilities, in its selection process.  DOE is in the process of conducting an inventory of its national complex to determine potential alternative facilities.  Likewise, DOE is also seeking by this action expressions of interest from commercial entities on locations and facilities for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury.  Because the Act states that this mercury would be stored at a "facility or facilities of [DOE]", DOE would work, as necessary, with the commercial entity on acquiring an appropriate interest in the facility prior to site designation.  
DOE plans to review each submission to determine if it should be included as a reasonable alternative in DOE's NEPA analysis, which will assess the environmental impacts of each alternative, including existing and new DOE facilities, as they relate to the long-term storage and management of elemental mercury.
As noted above, the amount of mercury to be stored is not well defined.  The size requirements for long-term storage and management facilities will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of elemental mercury ultimately received and the storage configuration of the elemental mercury containers.  Based on currently available information, for planning purposes DOE is looking for locations with one or more existing facilities with a total of approximately 20,000 to 100,000 square feet of storage space, or locations where such facilities could be constructed.  DOE anticipates refining the estimate of required storage space during the environmental review process.  DOE also requires that the facilities be in compliance with all current building codes and construction standards, be located in a geologically stable area (e.g., not in a flood plain or seismically-active zone), and be operated and maintained with appropriate security measures in place.  In addition, the Ac t requires that the facilities obtain and operate in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste facility permit.
IV.  AREAS TO ADDRESS IN SUBMISSION
DOE requires the following information for each potential storage location and facility:
1.	Name of the company making the Expression of Interest, including a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address;2.	Company address;3.	Company size (please specify as either Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), Hubzone Small Business or other);4.

A site map showing the location of the potential storage building or buildings on the site, as well as nearby (within 10 miles) political (e.g., city, county) boundaries, communities (especially minority, low income or Native American), roads, railroads, airports, and water bodies, wetlands, floodplains, parkland, known fault lines or other environmentally sensitive areas;6.	A description of the potential site, including ownership, current activities, access control system, hazardous materials handling experience, mercury handling experience, current tenants, existing permits, previous regulatory compliance problems, and existing environmental contamination; and 7.	A description of the potential storage building, if pre-existing, including date and type of construction, floor condition, any special features that provide protection against leaks and external environmental hazards, fire suppression system, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, access control system, current activities and materials in storage, current tenants, and existing environmental contamination.
If available, Expressions of Interest should also identify equipment, materials, and labor required to upgrade or construct the potential facility to accept elemental mercury for long-term management and storage, as well as any environmental, health and safety approvals that will be required by Federal, state or local law.
V.  FORMAT
The length of the Expression of Interest should be no more than 20 pages using 12-point font.  Although each respondent may determine how best to organize the Expression of Interest, DOE recommends the following format: Section 1 -- Summary; and Section 2 -- Description of Location with specific reference to the items requested by DOE above. 
DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate.  An interested party should avoid including any business confidential and/or proprietary information in its Expression of Interest.  However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party must provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.  DOE will review said information and handle it in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. ? 552) and all applicable Federal law.  
This Request for Expressions of Interest is not a formal solicitation requesting proposals and does not represent a commitment by DOE to award a contract.  This Request for Expressions of Interest does not confer any commitment or obligation from DOE.  Under no circumstances does this Request for Expressions of Interest seek to award a contract for services under the Federal Acquisition Regulations or a financial assistance agreement under Part 600 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  
DOE does not intend to formally respond to information submitted in response to this Request for Expressions of Interest.  
The cost for the preparation and submittal of a response to the Request for Expressions of Interest is the sole responsibility of the interested party.

and Reconstruction Algorithms for Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imaging
(EPRI) from GenEpria Consulting, Inc; 6011
  University Blvd, Suite 120; Ellicott City, MD 21048.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The supplies and services
herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition
procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.&nbsp; The North American Industry
Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard $7.0
Million. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Biophysical Spectroscopy
Section of the Radiation Biology Branch (RBB) is involved in developing low
field magnetic resonance imaging instrumentation, imaging approaches and image
reconstruction strategies to incorporate molecular/biochemical/physiological
imaging to characterize tumors in experimental animals and to use such methods
to understand mechanisms of drug action and also early prognostic data.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The contractor shall provide:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Interactive support in developing computational
algorithms for image data acquisition,
image reconstruction, and resolution recovery tools. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Co-registration of EPRI images,
MRI images with images obtained from hyperpolarized
MRI using13C labeled tracers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span>3. Image data analysis and statistical support</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The person working on this
project must have a Ph. D in physics/chemistry with at least 10 years
experience developing algorithms in image data acquisition and reconstruction
as evidenced by publications</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">EPRI is an emerging field. There
are no available software packages for image reconstruction or even algorithms
for image data acquisition from commercial sources, small or large. The EPRI
scanner at RBB, NCI is the first of its kind and the acquisition and image
reconstruction software written in house is not optimized for in vivo imaging
research. The quality of the images obtained using these algorithms have to be
determined by previously known standards published by the research group of
RBB/NCI (Journal of Clinical Investigation Vol. 118, pages 1965-1973, 2008)
which is available in open domain literature. GenEPRIA Consulting is the only
source for obtaining algorithms for image data acquisition and Image
reconstruction of EPRI data. GenEpria Consulting and Dr. Gadisetti have more
than 30 years of experience as a MR spectroscopist and also have more than 15
years of experience in developing algorithms for spectroscopic imaging using
EPRI. Since EPRI is practiced in very few laboratories, this expertise is not
available commercially. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is not a solicitation
for competitive quotations.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if
any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they
may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in
writing and must contain sufficient details to allow the NCI to determine if it

<CONTACT>Katie Cooney, Contracting Officer, Phone 4109659476, Email katie.cooney@ssa.gov
<DESC>SSA intends to establish a Firm Fixed price contract for the purchase of  upgrading and procuring two Social Security Number (SSN) card printers with the option of two additional printers.  SSA issues these SSN cards, including a unique 9-digit number and the full name, to citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents, as codified in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2).  SSA is currently utilizing two IBM 6262 impact printers to produce 80,000 SSN cards per day across multiple shifts.  These printers are dated technology with high maintenance cost, hard to find replacement parts and pose an increased risk of disruption to SSA’s card production workload.  With the number of printed cards expected to increase, the need to develop an alternative commercially available solution is imperative to ensure stability, security and high availability of SSA’s SSN card print technology.  The contract will encompass a base year with four option years to provide for maintenance after the warranty expires.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

• Building Ownership Information.
• Amount of parking available on-site and its cost – include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) has a need for textile fabrication services for a wide range of textile prototype items. This service will address surge demands for textile prototype fabrication that will supplement internal NSRDEC textile prototyping/ fabrication capabilities.  This requirement is oriented towards incremental designs and concept/developmental items.  As such, fabrication quantities are expected to be between 1 and 200 items.  Items fabricated under this contract will be evaluated and tested by the Government to enable continued/iterative design improvements and evaluation en route to a final design.  A key attribute of this contract is to replicate, to the greatest practical extent, the internal NSRDEC capability for prototype fabrication of textile items.  This capability is characterized by emphasis on certain characteristics such as timely and frequent face-to-face collaboration between the fabricator (contractor) and Government designers, rapid turnaround and delivery of fabricated items, and Government retention of unlimited rights to all technical data resulting from the collaborative and incremental fabrication process.<BR>The Draft Statement of Work and other attachments are available on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) (https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm) website under W911QY09R0016 and the Natick Contracting website (www3.natick.army mil (Business Opportunities/Upcoming Acquisitions/W911QY-09-R-0016). The Government anticipates making multiple awards, but reserves the right to make a single multiple or no awards. This requirement is a total 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code for these items is 541490, and the business size standard is $6,500,000.00. This is not a request for proposals (RFP).  The Government intends to make multiple Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) awards as a result of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Successful vendors will receive a guaranteed minimum order and will have the opportunity to compete on subsequent Task Orders. The Government anticipates a five year ordering period with One (1) Base Year and Four (4) Option Years.  Comments relating to this synopsis should be submitted via email to Kevin Parker, at kevin.james.parker@us.army.mil no later than 15 January 2009. The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 19 January 2009 and will be open for thirty (30) days.<BR>

<a href="mailto:Raymond.R.Greenheck@usace.army.mil">Portland District, US Army Corps of Engineers</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating  behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS).   Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  S elf-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons.  Cabled r eceivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS.  Numbers of clusters form arrays that are time synchronized using time obtained  from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers.  Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish.  Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in l aboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging.  A mobile receiver consisting of a single 4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on acti vely migrating tagged fish.   In 2008, the USACE intends to award a multi-year (1 year with 4 option years) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the manufacturing of the above receiver types.  In addition to manufacturing this c ontract will include line items for the repair and refurbishment of existing and future JSATS receivers; development of a graphical user interface for communication, retrieval of detection data, receiver diagnostic and acceptance testing checks for each re ceiver type.  All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package.  Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided.  Hydrophone assemblies  designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be provided by the government.  This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase.  In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria , the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receiver meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation.  The USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to 3 qualified firms.  These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action.  The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of a fully functional prototype receiver(s) that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor.  Followi ng acceptance testing of prototype receivers the USACE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract.  Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when  issued.  The solicitation (RFQ) outlining receiver specifications is expected to be posted on or about 11 April 2008 and the tentative quote due date is 30 May 2008.  The administrative/contracting point of contract is Ray Greenheck at (503) 808-4616.

PROAERO SMALL AIRPORTS NETWORK PROGRAM EXPANSION PLAN.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance for the PROAERO Small Airports Network Program Expansion Plan project for the State of Minas Gerais Transport and Public Works Secretariat.

In 2003, the Transport and Public Works Secretariat and the Economic Development Secretariat of the State of Minas Gerais instituted an airport program known as Programa Aeroportuário de Minas Gerais (PROAERO).  PROAERO's objective is to promote safety standards and economic development through an integrated network of paved and unpaved airports in Minas Gerais.  Projects implemented to-date through the PROAERO program have yielded benefits for the tourism, agriculture and health sectors (e.g., increased passenger and perishable cargo service, medivac services, donor organ shipment programs, forest fire safety and the establishment of new regional air carrier services).

In order to carry this program to its next phase, the government of the State of Minas Gerais, under the leadership of Governor Aécio Neves da Cunha, has authorized a budget of $207 million to expand PROAERO until 2011.  Through the expansion, PROAERO anticipates greater intra-state and inter-state civil aviation interconnection.  The State government's ultimate goal is for all municipalities to be within 50 miles of an airport.  The plan calls for developments and improvements at 162 airports and 24-hour service at approximately 70 of these airports by 2011.

To help meet these objectives, the Transport and Public Works Secretariat has requested USTDA funding for a technical assistance consultancy that will help to implement the next phase of the PROAERO program.  The technical assistance consultancy will provide the Secretariat with the basis for future capital expenditures, equipment procurement specifications, financing options, and program implementation.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $241,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: 

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm (local time), May 4, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH for Transportation Planning
DTFH61-09-R-00009


Pursuant to 48 C.F.R. Part 10, the Government is conducting market research to:

•Determine if sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Government’s requirements listed below,
•Determine the capabilities of potential contractors, including an estimate of prices, 
•Determine the size and status of potential sources, and
•Determine the level of competition (i.e. 8(a), set-aside or full and open)

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of the Department of Transportation (DOT), intends to establish multiple, 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for transportation planning expertise to assist DOT with respect to the technical support requirements described herein. 

BACKGROUND

The FHWA Office of Acquisition Management contemplates awards of multiple five-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in support of its Office of Planning, Environment and Realty.  The purpose for this announcement is to conduct market research to identify potential offerors having an interest in, and the resources to support this requirement.  Consideration will be given to identifying small business concerns, including the sub-categories of SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB and woman-owned.  The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. 

Work will be performed under those contracts through the issuance of competitively awarded Task Orders that may either be firm fixed price (FFP) or cost-plus-fixed- fee (CPFF). Competition for each Task Order will be restricted to those holding an ID/IQ contract.

The use of multiple award contracts will allow FHWA to take continuous advantage of the competitive forces of the commercial marketplace which will result in lower prices, better quality, and improved contractor performance in satisfying FHWA requirements.

This document is being published in order to gather information on potential sources and to identify sources capable of proposing. Please send responses to Sarah Sun at Sarah.Sun@dot.gov or fax 202-493-2198. In the event of a fax response, please also provide an E-Mail notification that a fax has been sent.

Description 

NIAID’s role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies.  As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research.  With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.

The use of in vitro assays helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  Therefore, the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) is committed to developing and providing in vitro assays to benefit the research community and public health.

For the most part, in vitro assay services and other research resources are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services and resources by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the In Vitro Assessments for Antimicrobial Activity program, which will utilize the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  

Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.  

The work under this acquisition has been broken into five Parts. Work under Parts A, B and D require Biosafety Levels (BSL) 1 through 3, and compliance with Select Agent Regulations through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and/or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (42 CFR Part 73, 7 CFR Part 331, and/or 9 CFR Part 121).  


1.	Part A – Bacteria and Fungi – Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening of products against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens, to include all bacteria and fungi on the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens list (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm) and other bacterial and fungal pathogens that cause disease in humans. 
2.	Part B - Viruses – Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening products against a wide range of viral pathogens, to include all viruses on the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens list, and other viral pathogens that cause disease in humans.
3.	Part C – Parasites and Vectors – Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening of products against a wide range of parasitic pathogens, to include all parasites and vectors on the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens list, and other parasitic pathogens that cause disease in humans. This Part also includes screening against cell lines from insect and other arthropod vectors.
4.	Part D - Toxins – Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening of products against a wide range of toxins, to include all toxins on the NIAID Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list.
5.	Part E – Central Data Management Center – Will support the development, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a central data management system to support all activities conducted under Parts A, B, C and D.  In order to qualify for work under Part E, Contractors must also qualify for one or more of Parts A-D.  

For the purposes of this acquisition:
•	Assays – in vitro procedures for determining the concentration, purity, and/or biological activity of a substance by measuring its effect on an organism, tissue, cell, enzyme or receptor preparation.
•	Products – broadly defined and include therapeutic substances targeting the host or the pathogen.  
•	Pathogens – bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins and fungi, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens.

<DESC><p>This RFI is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as solicitation/call for proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) or an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of that information. No contract or other instrument will be issued as a result of this RFI. The Combat Identification (CID) Investment Strategy Working Group (ISWG) is issuing a request for information for new and innovative CID concepts. Candidate technologies/concepts will be considered for potential funding by the SAF/AQID managed CID Program Element (PE) 63742F. However, at this time no firm requirement or funding exists and if a requirement materializes that requirement will be published in a BAA and formal proposals will be requested.
<p>Combat Identification is defined as the process of attaining an accurate characterization of detected objects or intent in the Joint battlespace to the extent that high confidence, timely application of military options and weapons resources can occur. The CID ISWG is looking for technology that is of sufficient maturity as to achieve a minimum of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 before CID PE funding starts. The CID concepts are geared towards technologies that can be developed and demonstrated, usually in a flight test, to sufficient level that a program office can integrate to an operational capability. Eventhough no current funding exists or solicitation/BAA call has been issued for these potential future requirements, the range of potential funded ideas are from $500,000 to $3,000,000.</p>
<p>Areas of interest may include but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Characterization and geo-location of difficult moving and stationary targets concentrating on civilian vehicles to dismount size<br />&bull; Characterization and ID of targets in adverse environmental, camouflage, concealment, deception or cluttered urban conditions<br />&bull; Target behavior and intent identification</p>
<p>Please provide two copies: one copy of requested info to Joseph Diemunsch, AFRL/RYZT and one copy to Barry Kain, Det 1 AFRL/PKSR, NLT 17 April 2009 . An AFRL and ESC team will subsequently review and prioritize all submissions for further consideration. The format of submission is as follows:</p>
<p>1) A brief summary (not to exceed two pages) of the program/concept. Include a schedule of events with associated funding requirements by fiscal year such that sufficient program/project information is available to evaluate and advocate for funding.<br />2) Please provide a hard and soft copy on a CD of the submission.<br />3) Please do not include commercial literature, brochures, catalogs or sales information.</p>
<p>You may be asked to present your concept during the May 2009 CID PE Review to be held at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH. All information received will be reviewed and prioritized to compete for potential CID PE funding. However, at this time no firm requirement nor funding exists and if a requirement materializes that requirement will be published in a BAA and formal proposals will be asked for at that time. The CID ISWG is looking for both short term and multiyear efforts that may be transitioned. If you have technology efforts you would like to submit for CID PE funding consideration, please forward two copies:</p>
<p>one copy to:</p>

<DESC>The 657th Aeronautical Systems Squadron (657 AESS), AeronauticalSystems Center (ASC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is contemplating the short-term lease (lease) of one (1) United States Air Force (USAF) active-duty C-130J aircraft (Aircraft) under Lease Agreement FA8625-09-L-6504 (the Agreement), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2667 and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 64-103. Purposes for the lease of Aircraft under the Agreement include orientation, demonstration, and evaluation flights associated with participation in the Paris Air Show, Le Bourget Airport, Paris, France, 15-21 June 2009. The term of the Agreement between the USAF (Lessor) and the contractor (Lessee) is expected to run from 8-22 June 2009. At this time, a USAF active-duty C-130J Aircraft is expected to be made available for lease under the Agreement; in the event that a USAF C-130J aircraft is unavailable for lease, a United States Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard C-130J aircraft may be available for lease under the Agreement. Any lease of Aircraft under the Agreement shall only take place on a non-interference basis with US Government requirements. A fixed daily rental charge and variable charges based on flight time shall be paid by the Lessee to the Lessor for all flights performed for the purposes listed above. These fees shall include charges for depreciation and interest of leased Aircraft, as well as costs associated with the upkeep of the airframe, engines, and major aircraft systems of leased Aircraft. Pursuant to DoD Directive 7230.8, no fixed daily or variable rental charge applies to a lease for: (1) air shows or trade exhibitions held outside the United States; or (2) for sales demonstrations to representatives of foreign governments. Under these circumstances, lease charges are limited to incremental costs incurred by the US Government in support of the lease that would not have been incurred had the Aircraft not been leased. During the term of the Agreement, the Lessee shall be responsible for all direct costs relating to leased Aircraft, including consumable supplies, aviation fuel, and Lessee labor costs associated with support and maintenance of leased Aircraft. The Lessee shall assume liability for charges that may be lawfully imposed on the Lessee by agencies of the US Government, or foreign governments and their taxing authorities, for certification and registration of leased Aircraft and payment of any applicable and lawful taxes or other charges. The Lessee shall be responsible for maintaining leased Aircraft in a safe and serviceable condition in accordance with approved procedures that meet or exceed current USAF-approved Technical Orders. The Lessee shall also affirm that it has implemented, and has in place, proper procedures and facilities to ensure the safe and proper operation and storage of leased Aircraft. The Lessee shall maintain adequate property control records, and shall maintain leased Aircraft records in accordance with the Air Force Technical Order 781 Series. The Lessee shall be solely and fully liable for any damage to, or loss or destruction of, leased Aircraft resulting from any cause whatsoever during the Lessee's possession of leased Aircraft. The Lessee shall agree to release the US Government from any and all damages (including consequential damages). The Lessee shall also defend, indemnify, and hold the US Government, its agents, officers, and employees, harmless from any and all loss and liability, whether in tort or in contract, that might arise in connection with the lease of an Aircraft (1) because of injury or death of personnel of the Lessor, the Lessee, or third parties; and (2) damage to, or destruction of, property of the Lessee or third parties, and leased property, support equipment, or other property of the US Government. The Lessee shall possess and maintain adequate insurance to cover all such liabilities, and proof of adequate insurance (or proof of the Lessee's ability to insure against loss) shall be provided to the Lessor. Accident investigations shall be performed in accordance with AFI 91-204 procedures, with investigative authority to remain with the USAF. The Lessee shall conform to applicable health and safety standards and safety rules, and shall take any additional precautions as the Government may require for safety and accident prevention purposes. The Lessee shall secure from the Department of State, or other responsible US Government agency, any export licenses or other approvals required under the Arms Export Control Act or other US laws or regulations prior to any use of leased Aircraft in connection with the provision of articles or services to a foreign Lessor or other foreign persons. The Lessee agrees that its logs, reports and records relating to leased Aircraft shall at all reasonable times be subject to inspection and review by any authorized representative of the USAF, and shall make such reports to the Lessor regarding leased Aircraft as may be required by the Government. Usage forecasts and test plans shall be submitted to the USAF for approval prior to any use of leased Aircraft. All air show appearances shall be approved through appropriate USAF channels, and shall be subject to air show participation procedures stated in AFI 64-103. Any transfer, encumbrance, or other use of leased Aircraft by the Lessee shall be prohibited without prior USAF approval. Any public release of information regarding the use of leased Aircraft shall be forwarded to and/or approved by the USAF, including news releases, photographs and photographic material, advertising, films, and pamphlets. Any use of leased Aircraft under the Agreement shall be from the premises of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Marietta, Georgia, or from another location as mutually agreed to between the Lessor and the Lessee. Direct all routine communication concerning this proposed Agreement to Mr. Joseph G. Lee, Contract Negotiator, 657 AESS/PK, by telephone at (937) 255-1398 or electronic mail at Joseph.Lee@wpafb.af.mil, or Mr. Kevin G.

<DESC><p>The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Hewlett-Packard Company, 6600 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817, for Asset Manager Upgrade. The software is part of a maintenance agreement BPD currently has with Hewlett Packard Company (HP). The migration from current web capabilities to web 5.1 is complex and must be completed by HP Professional Services due to the current Asset Center system configuration being modified significantly by HP. The Government intends to award a fixed price award for services.
<p>No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than five days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government than direct purchase through HP. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Hewlett-Packard Company. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Other Information: Electronic submissions, in response to this Notice, shall reference SS-BPD-09-0024 and be sent to the attention of Angala Zoller and e-mailed to psb2@bpd.treas.gov. Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00 PM ET, Monday, March 23, 2009. Please note that this is not a request for quotation.&nbsp; No solicitation document is available.<br /><br />Contracting Office Address: <br />Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), Division of Procurement, Avery 5F 200 Third Street, Parkersburg, WV, 26106-5312, UNITED STATES.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with State Net, 2101 K Street Sacramento, CA 95816-4920. In order to comply with NIST counsel recommendation and in order to fulfill the United States’ World Trade Organization (WTO) Member obligation under the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (TBT), NIST-National Center for Standards and Certification Information (NCSCI), (acting in its capacity as the U.S. WTO TBT Notification Authority) is required to notify the World Trade Organization of changes in U.S. technical regulations and conformity assessment rules at the Federal and sub-Federal (State) level. To fulfill this obligation, NCSCI proposes to purchase a specialized legislation and regulations information service, State Net, to monitor, process, and transmit proposed State regulations from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This comprehensive and searchable electronic tool is required to accomplish state-level monitoring because:
-although some states provide electronic access to regulatory information, over 60 websites would need to be monitored daily for state regulatory information;
-not all of the states’ regulatory information is available electronically, multiple subscriptions to paper registers would be required (with costs for subscriptions, cost of time spent searching for relevant items, cost of filing and storing information for future use);
-all states, DC, and the Federal Register could be monitored with one tool;
-the service is Internet based with unlimited access;
-contains full texts of all regulations as needed for notifications;
-is updated daily;
-is searchable; and
-customized issue screening and reporting is required due to the volume of materials to be reviewed. State Net is the only legislative and regulatory service that currently provides screening and reporting services in addition to customer access to the database.
State Net is the only legislative and regulatory service that currently provides screening and reporting services in addition to customer access to the database.
A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about April 1, 2009. 
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be emailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  532952.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the purchase of a manual defibrillator for the VA Medical Center in North Chicago, IL.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Zoll Medical Corporation. 3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Medical Center in North Chicago has a requirement for four manual defibrillators.  This product is required to enable healthcare providers real time feedback using a real CPR help option in order to perform better, more effective outcomes during a cardiac arrest.  The approximate cost is $88,736.66. 4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Medical Center in North Chicago has a requirement for four manual defibrillators.  The four new manual defibrillators must match the twelve manual defibrillators purchased in August, 2008, for the Medical Center.  In 2008 the Medical Center standardized to the Zoll Medical E series manual defibrillator.  Therefore, this sole source procurement is necessary as each crash cart has a defibrillator on it and it would present a patient safety issue if more than one type was utilized in the Medical Center.  If the Medical Center utilized two types of defibrillators, the employees could be confused on which one they were using in a life threatening situation.  The Medical Center would also have to stock duplicate electrodes for each type of machine, resulting in additional cost to the Government.  The Contractor is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the defibrillator.  It is the only known product that will interface with the Medical Center's current defibrillator units.  The unit provides the ability to see the actual waveform without motion artifact during CPR, which is capable only by using See Thru CPR.  In addition, the unit features rectilinear biphasic defibrillation.6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The COTR and end users have conducted market research on other manufacturers producing similar equipment.  The equipment varies too much to take the chance of placing an additional defibrillator on a crash cart that was not the same as the others already in use at the Medical Center.7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The Contractor has offered the VA GSA pricing on all items included in this procurement.8.	Market survey conducted:  The Contracting Officer conducted no additional research.  The COTR and end users have researched the market and were unable to locate any additional competition for this requirement.9.	Other facts:  None10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.WILLIAM TANKSLEYContracting Officer

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

The Government intends to award a Sole Source Purchase Order to assess the reproducibility of QFT-GIT results when the volume of the blood specimen used is both within- and out-of-range per the FDA approved package insert which allows a specimen range of 1.0 ml &plusmn; 0.2ml. The specimen volumes to be used per test subject collected at a single point in time are 0.5ml, 0.8ml, 1.0ml, 1.0ml, 1.0ml, 1.2ml, and 1.5ml. The objective is to assess the degree of discordance in QFT-GIT results across specimen volumes and to identify conditions under which discordance may be expected. The contractor shall also measure inter-assay agreement in QFT-GIT results when the test antigens are mixed with the whole blood specimens using two different mixing conditions:
<p>a. Whole blood specimens shall be mixed with the antigens by shaking to the point at which the blood begins to froth - this procedure is recommended by the QFT-GIT manufacturer and has been FDA approved.<br />b. Whole blood specimens shall be mixed with the antigens by rolling on a mixing platform (concurrently rocks and rolls tubes to assure full surface coverage) - this procedure is more consistent with the way phlebotomists are taught to handle blood specimens.<br />The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this solicitation.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

<DESC>GEOSCIENTIST TRAINING PROGRAM:
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The U. S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a competitive requirement for a Geoscientist Training Program to be awarded to the offeror whose Quote gives evidence of the greatest value to the Government as outlined in this synopsis.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable and as supplemented with additional information included in the notice.  Solicitation number M09PS00042 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30 and the Department of Interior Acquisition Regulation (DIAR).  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 entitled Engineering Services, with a small business size standard of $4.5M. QUOTATION PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: To ensure timely and equitable evaluation of quotes, Offeror must comply with instructions contained herein. Quotes must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this RFQ. The response shall consist of a technical and a cost/price quote.

INTRODUCTION: The Geosciences professionals at the MMS are responsible for evaluating fair market value of offshore leases, ensuring conservation and diligence of resource development, estimating the volume of public resources and reserves, and assuring safe operations throughout the Gulf of Mexico.  A training program to bring the many new employees and Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) personnel up to speed as soon as possible is essential.
OBJECTIVES:  With critical time frames outlined by the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012, new employees need an accelerated training program to bring them to minimum levels of competency in a shortened time frame.  This training program needs to accommodate 10 to 20 new employees, be intensive, concentrated, and tightly integrated with geology, geophysics and engineering disciplines. This training program should also be commercially available in an off-the-shelf configuration designed for oil and gas prospect and development analysis.  The training should integrate critical hands-on experience to allow the new employee to return from training and immediately contribute to mission goals.

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />Purchase of AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NB853000-9-08885SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 331111. The small business size standard is $1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(V and VI) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial items: <br />CLIN 0001 (beginning) - Specification for NIST 4340 Steel Purchase<br />Introduction:<br />The Materials Reliability Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, which NIST will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be sold by NIST as standard reference materials to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material. The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.<br />Compositional and melting requirements:<br />NIST require AISI 4340 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and micro&not;structural variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), NIST will allow some flexibility in the contract by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased and setting a maximum of $100,000.00 for the purchase. NIST prefers to purchase about 7000 lbs of steel. The bids are evaluated primarily on cost, but delivery time will be considered.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a double-vacuum-melting procedure (vacuum-induction-melt vacuum-arc-remelt, VIM-VAR). The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AISI-SAE alloy 4340. The steel must also meet the stricter requirements of AMS 6414, which describes steel production by a vacuum-melting procedure. In addition, we desire the phosphorus, sulfur, vanadium, niobium, titanium, and copper contents of the steel to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P = 0.010, (2) S = 0.010, (3) V = 0.030, (4) Nb = 0.005, (5) Ti = 0.003, and (6) Cu = 0.35. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, NIST requires that these elements (and inclusions) are at levels typically found for VIM-VAR 4340 steel.</p>
<p>The composition shall be certified using standard analytical procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment is calibrated by standards traceable to NIST. The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the remelted ingot. These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, meet our compositional requirements, and meet the limits on residuals given above. Deviations between the two measurements (in mass percent between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) cannot exceed 0.030 for C, Si, and Mo; 0.10 for Mn; 0.030 for Cr; 0.050 for Ni; 0.003 for P; and 0.001 for S.</p>
<p>Product Form:<br />The ingots shall be forged, rolled to billet, conditioned, then hot rolled to bar. The bar shall be finished to 0.50 inch square bar (+0.15 inch, -0.00 inch) and straighten. The corner radius of the finished bars cannot exceed 0.03 inches. The microstructure shall be uniform through the thickness, with a maximum acceptable grain size of ASTM number 7. In other attributes (decarburization, segregation, surface condition, etc.), the steel must be suitable for use as 10 mm square Charpy V-notch specimens.</p>
<p>The 0.50 inch bar shall be fully annealed to a hardness of RB-95 max. The suggested cycle is as follows: (1) heat to 1550 &ordm;F and hold for 6 hours, (2) furnace cool to 1200 &ordm;F and hold 12 hours, and (3) furnace cool to 800 &ordm;F and air cool to room temperature. NIST will accept alternate heat-treating schedules by mutual agreement. The goal is to produce bars with a minimum of large carbides in the structure, the most uniform carbide pre-cipitation possible, and a uniform hardness. The bar is required to be machine straightened (for twist and bow), and shipped in lengths of no more than 6 feet.</p>
<p>The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to the ingot position from which it was processed. This identification is used to limit the material used for a given lot to a single ingot location, which reduces micro&not;structural inhomogeneities between bars. The bundles must weigh less than 4000 lb, which is the capacity of the NIST fork lift truck. CLIN 0001 (ending).</p>
<p>(VII and VIII) Place of delivery is the Department of Commerce, Shipping and Receiving, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305. Delivery shall be FOB Destination Boulder, CO. Delivery will be due July 6, 2009. Offerors shall state the offered Delivery ARO.</p>
<p>All Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) full text Terms and Conditions can accessed at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.</p>
<p>(IX) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Sep 2006), applies to this acquisition. In addition to written price quotes, offers are instructed to provide capability statements describing qualifications and past performances in providing 4340 Steel Bars to customers.</p>

Reference 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration.<br />(XV) The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price order resulting from this solicitation. The total combined cost for the steel and shipping is "Not to Exceed" $100,000.00.</p>
<p>(XVI) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 12:00 P.M. MST/MDT on March 31, 2009. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Suzanne A.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<DESC><p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;
<p>The following are questions submitted regarding the Baltimore Conference RFQ along with the answers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q1.</p>
<p>Would [the government] be willing to consider using an overflow hotel for some of the rooms?&nbsp;.... we have existing reservations already for the dates in question. We work with a nearby [hotel], and could transport any of the overflow rooms <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">at no cost</strong>. Is this something that can be considered?</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">A1. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">Although it would be the government's preference to accommodate all at one location we would be willing to consider use of an overflow hotel depending on circumstances (e.g., distance, frequency of transportation between facilities, etc).&nbsp;Offeror to describe in sufficient detail to allow analysis of functionality in proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Q2.</p>
<p>I see that you are looking to rent 28 computers and five networked printers; is that figure correct? Do they need to be desktop PC's, or laptops?</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">A2.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">The number of computers and printers is firm and the government needs PC (as opposed to Apple/MAC) but there is no preference on desktop vs. laptops.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: navy">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Q3.</p>
<p>If an attendee cancels will they still be responsible for payment of no show.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">A3.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">Regarding reservations, billing, and minimum rooms, the government provides the following:&nbsp; FEMA will place on the contract 180 rooms for five nights for the weeks of April 26, May 10, and May 22.&nbsp; It is anticipated that a maximum of 200 rooms will be needed.&nbsp; Approximately 10 of these anticipated 200 rooms will be need for an additional night.&nbsp; For the week of July 27 FEMA will contract for 44 rooms for four nights with up to 60 rooms being anticipated. The contract will cover the minimum number of rooms as firm and will allow for the maximum number on an "as occupied basis."&nbsp; The government prefers that the participants are able to just show up without having to call in and reserve the rooms.&nbsp; The government understands participants having to give a credit card at time of registration to cover incidentals. The resultant contract(s) will not cover incidentals (room service, in-room movies, tips, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>This is amendment No. 1 to the combined synopsis/solicitation entitled CandidateLi-ion Cell Designs for the International Space Station Battery which was posted on March05, 2009. You are notified that the following changes are made: 1. This amendment hereby establishes a maximum 25 page limitation for supportingtechnical rationale.2. This amendment answers questions that have been submitted.  See below.Question: Are there any page or formatting limitations to the proposal? Answer: This amendment establishes a maximum 25 page limitation for supporting technicalrationale.Question: Do you want the quote to include one (1), ten or twenty (20) single-cell testfixture clamps? The RFQ appears to ask for 20, but that does not seem to make sense,unless the requirement is not well understood. (Cells from the 10 cell fixture will alsobe used in single cell fixtures, for example) Answer: If the cell design proposed requires fixturing to perform during NASA'sperformance acceptance and LEO life tests, then one (1) ten-cell fixture and twenty (20)single cell fixtures are required to be delivered with the 20 single cells as stated inthe RFQ. Also, if necessary to ensure consistent performance, provide assemblyinstructions for the fixtures.Question: Do you want this to be a Firm Fixed Price quote?Answer: Yes.Question: The 120V ISS Li-ion Battery ORU Requirements list: Operating Voltage Window Useful discharge/charge capacity shall be delivered/acquired between 76 and 126 Vdc. For typical Li-ion cell voltage ranges, the high end of 126 VDC would not have beenexpected to equate to a low end as low as 76. If conservative (for maximum cycle-life)cell EoCV of 3.95 V is defined, then the 126 V battery EoCV would lead to a 32-cellbattery. Then a cell-level 3.0V EoDV would equate to a battery-level EoDV of 96 V, wellabove 76V. Please confirm the Operating Voltage Window lower limit value. Answer: The 76 to 126 Vdc window is the current one used by the incumbent Ni-H2 system.Your proposed lithium-ion concept can utilize a narrower window and still meet therequirements of the RFQ.Question: The current ISS Battery ORU envelope includes a designated Electronics zone,per SOW Figure 1, which is presumably based on the current legacy Ni-H2 batteryconfiguration. If the Offeror has a complete integrated Li-ion battery design, includingelectronics, which fits within the overall ORU envelope, including thecurrently-designated electronics zone, must the existing design be deconstructed toseparate the cells and electronics, or can the entire ORU envelope (except for the twosmaller keep-out zones), be used? The potential benefits of maximizing the ISS/CEVCommonality goal by using an already space-qualified CEV battery (or very closederivative thereof), which could be mounted as-is directly into the ISS ORU and connectedto ORU mechanical and electrical interfaces, would be very compelling. These benefitswould seem to far outweigh any potential value of retaining the legacy electronics zone,unless it is also used for non-battery purposes. The 2 keep-out zones could, in any case,still be preserved. Please confirm that we may include ISS ORU design options that makeuse of portions of the current Electronics zone. Answer: For the purpose of your cell design selection for your quotation, NASA recommendsthat you propose a battery design concept that meets the required keep out zonesspecified in the RFQ. Trading battery concepts that don't meet the RFQ requirements isbeyond the current scope of NASA cell evaluation effort. The due date for responses is not extended.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.

<DESC>Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation W912JC-09-R-5712 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted Full and Open Competition with no set asides. This ID-IQ contract is to provide plastic and glass media for paint removal from Kansas Army National Guard vehicles. Base year contract begins April 2009 thru April 2010 with the option for four additional one-year periods. The additional one year contract options are exercised if the product performance and customer service from the contractor is deemed to be of a satisfactory or better nature.  

Estimated quantities/type: Both plastic and glass media will meet commercial standards. It is estimated that 27,500 lbs equals a calendar month of Type II UREA Plastic (Bead Blast Media Type 2, 10-20 Grit) and 5,600 lbs per calendar month of White Blast Glass Media (Number  Designation 2, course, Size Range 10-30, Partial Count 300,000/lb) is estimated for consumption. 

1. The minimum quantities to be purchased under this contract will be 82,500 lbs of Type II UREA Plastic and 16,800 lbs White Blast Glass media that is comparable to three calendar months of media as noted above for the base year and for any option years exercised in total.

2. The maximum quantities can equal as much as 330,000 lbs of Type II UREA Plastic media and 67,200 lbs of White Blast Glass Media that is comparable to 12 calendar months of media as noted above for the initial base year and each option exercised thereafter.  The aforementioned media blast maximum quantities are based off of previous year’s usage for estimate purposes only and in no way entitles an awarded contractor to an equity adjustment if the maximum amounts are not met or exceeded. 

Pick-Up/Delivery Schedule: Media will be delivered to FOB Destination Readiness Sustainment Maintenance Site (RSMS) at Camp Funston Bldg 1598, FT Riley, KS 66442-0345. All deliveries will be upon order from the Government.

1. The plastic media shall be delivered in re-usable DOT approved containers or in other approved containers. One container will contain approximately 250 lbs of new plastic media. Containers shall be capable of being resealed, and shall be reusable to collect spent material for recycle purposes.  Glass white blast media will be delivered in 50 lb bags. 

2. The refilled spent media containers shall be labeled identifying the media size, batch number and the weight of the media. 

3. KSARNG Quality Assessment personnel will spot check the quality of the plastic and glass media delivered under this contract. The government has the right to reject any unsatisfactory media and have the contractor replace it at no additional expense to the Government. 

Shipping: The offeror shall be responsible for all shipping, handling and transportation costs of which should be incorporated into proposal estimates.  Applicable state and federal Hazardous Waste materials certificates for the transport of spent media leaving the KS RSMS FT Riley are the responsibility of the awarded contractor to obtain and will be verified by the FT Riley Environmental Office at their discretion.  

Recycling: All media needs to be on a leasing/recycle program where the vendor delivers the new media and picks up the used media for recycle.  The details of the recycle plan shall include the facility location and the recycle process described in a detailed narrative with any needed illustrations, pictures or video to allow for a full understanding of the offeror’s recycle process.  Estimated turn around recycle time lines should be included in the offeror’s recycle plan.  The recycle plan described in detail will be forwarded to this agency must be included with all offeror’s submissions for award consideration.  Submitting a recycle plan does not guarantee technical acceptability.  

1. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make the determination if a proposed recycle plan from the offeror submitting the RFP is legitimate. Any recycle program that is not deemed as legitimate by the EPA will not be considered technically acceptable and thereby removed from consideration for award.

2. The offeror will separately list each drum and the weight of each drum collected on the hazardous waste manifest and on the bill of lading.  The offeror must transport all spent media to their off-base designated recycling facility.  The recycling facility must forward the bill of lading from each container that has completed the recycle process to include the facility disposition report to the Waste Minimization Manager’s office under the Environmental Division at FT Riley of whom will compare recycled material reports with spent material leaving FT Riley.  This will be done to ensure the amount of spent media leaving FT Riley RSMS is equal to the spent media being recycled.  A second copy of these documents shall be sent to the KS RSMS for recordkeeping purposes.

3. The recycle process for the spent media must be recycled within the Continental United States and may not be sent for recycle outside of the US. The recycle program of the awarded company will be subject to audit without notice throughout the entire performance of the contract. 

4. Past performance information should include a list of prior contracts for this service awarded within the past 3 years if applicable. Offerors shall submit an estimated delivery schedule turnaround time for anticipated orders.  The information shall include a valid point of contact, mailing address, telephone number, contract number and dollar amount.

Pricing considerations: Prospective Offerors shall submit a price proposal in a measure of cost per pound for delivery of each type of media blast to include the shipping and recycle costs of spent media blast shall be included in the proposed price. The proposal shall include pricing for the base year, and option year one through option year four. Proposals shall be evaluated as Lowest Price Technically Acceptable to the government. For evaluation purposes, the lowest bid will be determined by totaling the price for the base and option years and dividing by 5 (years) using stated minimum quantities.  In order to receive an award, registration is required in the Central Contractor Registration database at www.ccr.gov. Multiple awards will not be issued.

<DESC>AMENDMENT A001
The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.  

The due date for quotations, 3:30 PM local time on March 18, 2009, remains unchanged.

QUESTION:  Item 7 seems fairly clear now, in that it appears that this relates to the ability to do 3D X-ray Maps in combination with the FIB. As mentioned this afternoon, FEI has contacted _(THE VENDOR)____ to do this exact thing with the NNL600, and that meeting will take place next week. Delaying the bid response date by 2 weeks would allow us (and other competitors who FEI is also working with) to know exactly what is possible, and to supply NIST with a system that more closely matches your needs. This sort of compatibility and integration requires that the EDS company and FEI work closely together, and the project is still being defined by FEI.
      
RESPONSE:  For Line Item 0007, NIST is talking about the ability to communicate with an FEI
instrument.  All EDX vendors can do this currently.  NIST currently has an Oxford EDS system that is integrated with the NNL600 system.  NIST also has a custom solution that takes care of the 3D X-ray mapping (non FEI or Oxford).  

Inclusion of this requirement ensures that the system purchased has the same on the fly analysis capability stated in items 1-5 and can get the signal from NIST’s existing NNL600.

Discussion vendors are having to do 3D X-ray mapping is not relevant to item 7 because NIST currently has a way to deal with this.

QUESTION:  Item 8 - Capability to Interface is still very vague. In essence, it appears that you are asking us if we will write code for you for an as-yet-unknown feature or capability sometime in the future. Without knowing what it is that you  may want to do (and what FEI is willing to do), I don't know how any responsible company could say yes to this.

RESPONSE:  Item 8 is only specifying whether quoters are able to provide programming services to NIST.  It is attractive to hire a programming service from the EDS system provider since they will be more knowledgeable about the detection system then a generic software solution provider.  So the key question is, does the quoter have the capability to provide custom software development service.

<DESC>The following is an answer to a question received prior to the 1:00pm Eastern on March 12, 2009 deadline for questions:

Question 22:  The solicitation describes the requirement to “track and analyze…accounting matters” [p2].  Can the Government elaborate on the scope of the term “accounting matters”—whether, for example, the intended focus is at the firm, industry practice level or beyond?
Answer 22:  The intended focus is at the firm and industry practice level.  An example of this activity would be advising the SEC if the adoption of accounting policies and procedures (i.e., FASB standards, EITF issues, IFRS, tax) might present an adverse effect on the financial statements of certain registrants.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic Corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign Corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.   Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i)    Warrants; 
    (ii)   Options; 
    (iii)  Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv)  Convertible debt instruments;

    (2)   Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 

    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104–75, insert the following clause: 
Prohibition on Contracts With Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) Warrants;
(ii) Options;
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) Convertible debt instruments;
(v) Others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

"ENCLOSURE:  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.
 
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Synopsis:<BR>Contractor information is as follows: Log Sec Group, LLC, 9400 Innovation Drive, Suite 120, Manassas VA, 20110.<BR><BR>The Department of the Army, Aberdeen Installation Contracting Division (AICD) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, formally known as the Department of the Army, Army Contracting Agency, Northern Region (ACA NR), Aberdeen Directorate of Contracting (APG DOC), intends to noncompetitively extend the final option year, Option Year 4 (OY4) for an additional 4 months under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency. <BR><BR>Background:<BR>The APG DOC awarded Log Sec Group contract W91ZLK-04-D-0007 with an effective date of April 1, 2004, to provide non-personal Information Technology (IT) support services to five main customers. The acquisition plan submitted and approved by ACA NR Headquarters in February 2004 included an estimated cost of $116M over a seven year period. The actual award period was reduced to five years (Base + Four Option Years). The total estimated cost of the five year period became approximately $63M. As the work progressed, additional support activities were added. Unforeseen requirements emerged that necessitated the use of this award for critical mission operations. This multi-activity contract utilizes two different contract types: Firm Fixed Price effort and Time and Materials effort. Upon initial award the Directorate of Information Management (DOIM) portion of this contract was performance based and the other four customers (RDECOM, CHPPM, AEC and 20th Support) were non-performance based. After the base year, CHPPM became performance based. The service for the 20th Support were not required for OY 4. <BR><BR>The first J&A was approved to exceed the value of the total award and OY 4 amounts. Current award funding including all option years is approximately $101M. Announcement of the J&A for an exception to full and open competition for execution of the final option year to Log Sec Group was posted via the Army Single Face to Industry on March 27, 2008.<BR><BR>Current:<BR>Option Year 4 will expire on March 31, 2009 and a second J&A is contemplated for unusual and compelling reasons to extend OY 4 and continue Agency Information Technology Services and Support (AITSS) services with Log Sec Group, until a replacement award is completed. The 4 current customers (2 performance and 2 non-performance based) which are provided services through this AITSS contract are requesting the extension of OY 4 to prevent mission failure. This extension will be for 4 months of continued AITSS services at a cost of approximately $7M. The projected total value of the contract is approximately $109M. The required AITSS services to be performed during the additional 4 months have been identified as being within the scope of the contract. The continuing contract type is firm fixed price effort and time & materials effort. Fiscal Year 2009 Operations & Maintenance (O&M) funds are cited for use with this proposed action. All current and future requirements remain within the original scope of work for this award. <BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest, in writing to the Government point of contact. All responses received by March 31, 2009 will be considered by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. For specific questions, please contact the Acquisition Project Officer, thomas.campanajr@conus.army.mil <BR>

<DESC>The following three questions were received in response to RQF # Sp4704-09-Q-1031.  The questions and their corresponding answers are provided below.

Question #1: Can we get (software and hardware) technology stack information on the current implementation?
Answer #1: Answer - We currently have the software managed from one server in Battle Creek.  That server is our Systems Management Server 2003 parent server.  We also have wake up agents on all Windows desktops, laptops, and servers on our domain (service installation).


Question #2.	What kind of users are there for the existing system?
Answer #2: The only "users" for our existing wake up implementation are the
system administrators who are responsible for security patching and software
installations via Systems Management Server (soon to be System Center
Configuration Manager).  They are the only people who have access to the 1E
Wake Up console.  However, the wake up functionality is used on every
Windows device in our domain.


Question #3: What kind of interfaces the system currently has? 
Answer #3: There is a 1E Wake Up console add-on for Systems Management Server (again soon to be System Center Configuration Manager) that provides the interface.

The date and time set for receipt of quotations remains unchanged.

<DESC>IN VITRO ASSESSMENTS FOR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY



INTRODUCTION

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the services as specified below.

The information from this market research will help National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  NIAID/DMID WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
		
BACKGROUND

NIAID’s role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies.  As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research.  With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.

The use of in vitro assays helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  Therefore, DMID is committed to developing and providing in vitro assays to benefit the research community and public health.

For the most part, in vitro assay services and other research resources are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services and resources by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the In Vitro Assessments for Antimicrobial Activity program, which will utilize the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  

Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAVAIRWARCENACDIV) Lakehurst intends to procure, via full and open competition, a replacement system for the existing AN/USM-636(V) Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) with a next generation test system solution, herein referred to as electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS).

General Description:  CASS is a common family of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for automated avionics/electronics testing at Navy Intermediate Level maintenance and Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) sites both shore-based and afloat.  Legacy mainframe CASS systems are approaching the end of their useful service life and will be replaced with eCASS.  With the replacement of legacy mainframe CASS, reutilization of approximately 750 existing CASS Test Program Sets (TPSs) is required on eCASS while maintaining or improving fidelity of test, run-times and performance.  The Offeror will be responsible for any TPS software processes and related tools required for CASS TPS migration to eCASS.  The new test station shall have a compatibility mode that will emulate existing CASS station characteristics in order to maintain legacy CASS TPS performance and will also have an eCASS mode that permits taking advantage of the full range of advanced eCASS station capabilities.  The program will include delivery of eCASS TPS development suites, which includes a “CASS to eCASS” TPS conversion toolset.

eCASS will be procured as one core system, known as an eCASS Core System, and five different eCASS Mission Equipment Kits (MEK).  The eCASS Core System and different combinations of eCASS MEKs allow eCASS to perform the five legacy CASS missions (legacy CASS Configurations) and a new eCASS Depot mission.  The six missions, along with the equipment to perform the missions are as follows:
a.	Hybrid Mission - An eCASS Core System alone will perform the legacy CASS Hybrid Mission and legacy ancillary.
b.	Radio Frequency Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS Radio Frequency MEK (RF-MEK) performs the legacy CASS Radio Frequency Mission.  This combination of eCASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS RF System.
c.	Communication, Navigation, and Identification Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS RF-MEK, an eCASS Communication, Navigation, and Identification Mission Equipment Kit (CNI-MEK), and the GFE CASS Communications, Navigation, and Identification Ancillary Set (CNIAS) performs the legacy CASS CNI Mission.  This combination of eCASS and CASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS CNI System.
d.	High Power Mission – An eCASS Core System with an eCASS RF-MEK, an eCASS High Power Mission Equipment Kit (HP-MEK), and the GFE CASS HPDTS performs the legacy CASS High Power Mission.  This combination of eCASS and CASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS HP System.
e.	Depot Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS RF-MEK and an eCASS Depot Mission Equipment Kit (DEPOT-MEK) performs the new eCASS Depot Mission.  This combination of eCASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS Depot System.
f.	Electro-Optics Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS Electro-Optics MEK (EO-MEK) and the GFE CASS EO Console performs the legacy CASS Electro-Optics Mission.  This combination of eCASS and CASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS EO System.

eCASS shall be designed for shipboard and shore-based use, and shall be compliant with the eCASS specification and all other applicable documentation.  Some eCASS documentation is only accessible via the eCASS Technical Library.  Instructions to Prime Offerors and subcontractors for obtaining access to the eCASS Technical Library will be included in the RFP at Section L, Paragraph 7.0.  All Offerors interested in obtaining this data should be prepared to submit a certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.  To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800) 352-3572 or http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp.  

The contract type is anticipated to be Cost-Plus Incentive Fee for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion with Fixed Price Incentive options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I and LRIP II deliveries.  The anticipated quantities for the basic contract will include the efforts to design, test and produce fourteen (14) Engineering Development Models (EDMs) to support Design Testing.  Also required are EDM RF-MEK, CNI-MEK, HP-MEK, DEPOT-MEK, EO-MEK, SMAT/CAL OTPS Kits; Calibration Equipment Kits; TPS Development Suites; CASS Qualification Test OTPS; technical and logistical data; training; and up to 20,000 hours of annual engineering and logistics services to support eCASS.  The contract will contain LRIP options to procure up to twenty (20) LRIP I eCASS RF Systems in FY13 and up to twenty (20) LRIP II eCASS RF Systems in FY14, along with additional items to support the LRIP eCASS systems.

This procurement will be full and open.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select “Doing Business” and then “Open Solicitations.”  Look for amendments on the web page.  Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors.  The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 30 March 2009.  The Government will NOT accept electronic offers.

<DESC><B>VENDOR:  <U>Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements Contract for the planning and delivery of training related to SSA’s Disability Hearing Officer (DHO) Training requirements.</U></B>

The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a <U>full and open competetive acquisition</U> to establish a follow-on, Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements contract for the continuation of services for the planning and delivery of training related to SSA’s HO Training requirements.  The anticipated contract will allow the services to continue for the period of performance of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014.  

SSA has developed and implemented a process whereby disability beneficiaries who have been notified that their disability has ceased, did not exist, or is no longer disabling are provided a face-to-face due process evidentiary hearing at the reconsideration level of SSA’s appeals process. This due process hearing, commonly referred to as a disability hearing, is generally the responsibility of the Disability Determination Specialists (DDS); however, a Federal process has been established for States that have declined the process and for cases in which the initial determination was made.  The decision maker at this face-to-face hearing is referred to as the DHO.  

BACKGROUND: On July 1, 2004, SSA awarded a five-year, Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements contract to the McGeorge School of Law for these services. McGeorge was instrumental in the initial design for the training program, and have been conducting this training for SSA for over 20 years. 

REQUIREMENTS: To maintain the disability hearings process, SSA must provide for the training of non-attorney type employees involved in the disability hearing process. These hearings are conducted under the guidance of the Goldberg vs. Kelly, US Supreme Court decision that mandates how and in what manner such a hearing is to be conducted to ensure the claimant receives due process. This contract will allow SSA to continue to obtain the necessary services of a qualified contractor who can provide high quality classroom training in due process requirements.  Note: Refer to the solicitation for specific requirements once uploaded to FedBizOpps.  

This contract action is pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.501(a) (1) (ii) under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).

Solicitation number SSA-RFQ-09-1290 is scheduled for release on or about March 18, 2009.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the FedBizOpps.gov website.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFQ WILL NOT BE MAILED OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTED.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS).</p>
<p>Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River. Self-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons. Cabled receivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS. Numbers of clusters form arrays that are time synchronized using time obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish. Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in laboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging. A mobile receiver consisting of a single 4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on acti vely migrating tagged fish.</p>
<p>In 2008, the USACE intends to award a multi-year (1 year with 4 option years) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the manufacturing of the 4 receiver types mentioned above. In addition to manufacturing, this contract will include line items for the repair and refurbishment of existing and future JSATS receivers; development of a graphical user interface for communication, retrieval of detection data, receiver diagnostic, and acceptance testing checks for each receiver type. All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package. Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided. Hydrophone assemblies designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be provided by the government.</p>
<p>This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase. In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria, the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receivers meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation. USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to 3 qualified firms. These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action. The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of a fully functional prototype receiver(s) that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor. Following acceptance testing of prototype receivers the USACE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract. Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.</p>
<p><strong>The solicitation (RFQ) outlining receiver specifications is expected to be posted on or about&nbsp;02 June&nbsp;2008 and the tentative quote due date is&nbsp; 01 August 2008.</strong> The administrative/contracting point of contract is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HAS CHANGED.</span> Please contact&nbsp;Kathryn Newhouse at </strong><a href="mailto:Kathryn.A.Newhouse@usace.army.mil"><strong>Kathryn.A.Newhouse@usace.army.mil</strong></a><strong>, or via phone at 503-808-4620.
