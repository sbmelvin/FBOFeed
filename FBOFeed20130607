<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NAS2-02090 with Lockheed Martin Space Operations on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The performance period will be extended for a potential seven month period of performance, consisting of one 3-month base period and four 1-month options. The principle purpose of this contract is to support science, space, exploration efforts through discrete programs and projects.  At NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) the Programs and Projects Directorate conducts and manages programs, projects and develops and executes missions.  Support requirements span multiple Directorates at ARC, other NASA Centers and NASA Headquarters.	In order for the various Directorates to develop, manage, and execute programs within its mission area, research and development is required in the areas of Program Management, Project Management, Program Support, Collaborative Technologies, Engineering, Hardware and Software Systems Engineering and Educational Outreach. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NAS2-02090, for three (3) months, from July 1, 2013 through September 30, 2013, for the base period; and end on January 31, 2014, if all four 1-month options are exercised. The extension will not increase the current contract value. The extension is the Governments best interest to provide ongoing Programs and Projects services until a new contract is awarded.  The current Contractor, Lockheed Martin is considered the only Contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period of performance for the extension. The three (3) month extension with four (4) 1-month options is necessary to maintain the critical continuity of support services until the current procurement process for the follow-on contract has been completed and a new contract awarded. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 pm local time on Monday, June 17, 2013.

(73342) P/N 23011049, which is the P/N called out on the source controlled drawing I/A/W DRAWING NR 19207 12267211. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 129 each to be shipped to (SW3120) Anniston AL 36201-4199. FOB destination and inspection at destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 06/22/13. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, and past performance. The required delivery is 150 days within an incremental delivery schedule. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC>This is a market survey for the Searles Valley, Indian Wells, and Owens Valley Airport Surveillance Radar Sites. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense. 

At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside the procurement for small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small business or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program. The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 238220- Air-conditioning system (except window) installation.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and 8(a) certified firms.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price, low priced technically acceptable offer.

Responses to this market survey must be submitted to deana.galloway@faa.gov by 11:00 AM PST on Tuesday, June 18, 2013.

In order to meet this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
(a)	Capability Statement
(b)	Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)
(c)	Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service disabled veteran owned small business (if applicable)

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for Small Business Set-Aside procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.&nbsp; In support of this mission, and the Secretary of Transportation's emphasis on distracted driving NHTSA has a requirement to study the role distraction (both pedestrian and driver) plays in pedestrian-involved vehicle crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;</li>
<li>Providing grants to state and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs;</li>
<li>Marketing and promoting safety messages, campaigns and materials to various audiences aimed at raising awareness and influencing and sustaining positive traffic safety behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belts and preventing impaired driving is the most effective means to meet NHTSA's core mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHTSA estimates that increasing safety belts use can reduce crash fatalities by up to 45 percent in cars and 60 percent in light trucks. Every one percent increase in safety belt use translates into 2.8 million more Americans buckled up, 250 additional lives saved and 4,000 fewer serious injuries annually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impaired driving-related deaths account for 42 percent of all traffic fatalities annually. Driving impaired is one of the most often committed crimes in America, affecting 1 in 3 citizens annually, resulting in 1 fatality every 30 minutes, 45 deaths every day and more than 13,000 fatalities annually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on ten (10) plus years of research, NHTSA and its partners have determined that conducting traffic enforcement with highly visible publicity and advertising is the most effective way to influence audiences to buckle up and deter impaired driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHTSA's national communications plan supports the agency's policy and program priorities. High Visibility Enforcement for safety belt use and impaired driving prevention is the cornerstone of the national plan. NHTSA recommends that States and local communities also implement HVE as the foundation of their communications efforts and build around their key enforcement periods. Based on numerous years of experience working at the national and state levels, NHTSA has developed recommendations for communications strategy and tactical plans for state and local partners to effectively promote traffic safety year round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Objective:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective of these Contracts is to provide professional communication support for NHTSA Regional Office in Region 8, consisting of the following states:<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt"> </span>Colorado, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, to support seat belt and impaired driving program efforts as well as other priority highway safety programs.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Solicitation Information:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed sixty (60) months will be awarded. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at <a href="https://www.fedbizopps.gov/">https://www.fedbizopps.gov</a> referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-13-R-00741). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about June 24, 2013. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<RESPDATE>062113
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick Staines, Contracting Officer, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Westboro Photonics, of Ottowa, Canada, for the purchase of an Instrument Systems CCD Detector under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).
<p><br />NIST currently utilizes an existing Instrument Systems spectroradiometer, which is used for optical measurement in the Physical Measurement Laboratory's Sensor Science Division. NIST has a research need to expand the current Instrument Systems spectroradiometer system into a CCD-array spectroradiometer, through the integration of a CCD detector into the current spectroradiometer system.</p>
<p>Westboro Photonics is the only responsible source for the required CCD detector, as they are the sole North American distributor of Instrument Systems products. The Instrument Systems CCD detector is the only CCD detector in the marketplace that is 100% compatible in terms of software with NIST's existing Instrument Systems spectroradiometer system. The development of new software, or integration of a new software system to existing software programs, would cause delays as well as the expenditure of significant man-hours and the incurring of significant costs which would not be recouped through competition.</p>
<p>In addition, the Instrument Systems CCD detector is completely parts-interchangeable and 100% hardware compatible with the existing Instrument Systems spectroradiometer. Purchasing a CCD detector from another source would require extensive modifications to the existing spectroradiometer system, which would cause an unacceptable delay in its ultimate deployment as well has significant additional costs.</p>
<p>Westboro Photonics is the only vendor for the required CCD detector, and no other suppliers can satisfy NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) on June 21, 2013. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>Since the late 1970's, the federal responsibility for supporting U.S. earthquake hazard assessment and risk reduction has rested with the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). NEHRP is a statutory cooperative partnership of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the US Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Congress most recently passed the NEHRP Reauthorization Act of 2004, Public Law (PL) 108-360 (http://www.nehrp.gov/about/PL108-360.htm), which the President signed into law on October 25, 2004. PL 108-360 directing that NEHRP activities be designed to develop effective measures for earthquake hazard reduction; promote the adoption of earthquake hazards reduction measures by government agencies, standards and codes organizations, and others involved in planning and building infrastructure; improve the understanding of earthquakes and their effects through interdisciplinary research; and, develop, operate, and maintain both the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/anss/) and the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/nees/about.jsp. PL 108-360 also directed that NEHRP support development and application of performance-based seismic design (PBSD).
<p><br />NIST has a requirement for a Contractor to provide support to NIST EL through an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for one (1) twelve-month base period plus four (4) one-year option periods. The specific tasks pursuant to this effort are described in the Statement of Work which will be included in the solicitation. It is anticipated that the solicitation for this work will be issued on or about June 27, 2013, using FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, through 100% unrestricted competition. The Government anticipates the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, resulting in fixed price task orders, on or about September 23, 2013. The competitive solicitation, all amendments, and any questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The solicitation will only be available via the Internet at the above website. Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored, and a bidders list will not be maintained. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to divya.soni@nist.gov. To be eligible for award, offerors MUST be registered with the System for Award Management: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ and have completed its representations and certifications found online at SAM. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330.</p>

<DESC>Subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Solicitation for Information of Planning Purpose, this announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes. FLC Norfolk Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Annex's intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle for the design and construction of a new Incident Command Post Trailer (ICPT) to support emergency response operations at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

The contractor shall develop a set of specifications with the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to be utilized as a design basis for the new ICPT. All specifications shall meet Department of Defense requirements and national codes.
 Once the specifications are approved and an acceptable design has been created, the contractor will construct the new ICPT. An example specification is attached along with this notice to give an idea of the level of detail the Government anticipates (reference Attachment A of this notice).

Additionally, during the specification development stage, the contractor shall develop a commissioning program to support testing of the new ICPT and its systems when completed. This commissioning program shall be performed by an independent individual/agency on-site at the Shipyard to ensure that the Government has been provided a safe and operational trailer that meets its unique operational requirements.

SPECIFICATION / DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:

A list of items/functions the Government anticipates requiring to support operations in the ICPT is provided below.
  This list is based on attributes identified to date by the Incident Commander and members of his response team.  This list is by no means complete and is intended only as a guide.  The Government shall seek input from the selected contractor for the inclusion of other features/equipment based on their experience in constructing these types of vehicles.

ICPT basic items / functions

1.  The ICPT shall be based on a trailer design utilizing a standard king pin / fifth wheel.  Length of the final trailer design should not exceed forty (40) feet.

2.  A suitably sized electric power generator shall be provided to support continuous operations in the ICPT.  Suitable filtering of the power provided by the generator shall be included in order to prevent damage to the miscellaneous electronics anticipated to be installed.

3.
  The ability to connect to the Shipyards temporary shore power pedestals will also need to be included in the design.  This functionality shall include a pre-staged cable of sufficient capacity and length stored on a reel to support shore power connection.

4.  An appropriately sized HVAC system shall be provided to support year round operations in the New England seacoast area.

5.  A minimal galley space shall be provided for in the design.  This galley shall have a microwave and coffee pot with cabinet storage.  No refrigerator shall be installed.

6.  A bathroom with an incinerating toilet shall be provided to minimize the dependence upon a sanitary sewer system connection point.

7.
  An enclosed Observation Area with desk surfaces shall be provided for the IC and ICPT staff.  This observation area shall allow the IC to observe the affected area and response operations from the ICPT.

8.  An isolatable conference area will be provided.  This area shall be separate from the main Operations Floor (Radio/Data Acquisition Area) and the Observation Area in the ICPT.

9.  Mast mounted scene lighting shall be included in the ICPT design to support night time response operations.

Communications

1.  A radio network or system shall be included to support simultaneous transmission from a minimum of six (6) independent frequencies at six (6) different responder locations.  The antenna mast(s) installed to support this communication requirement shall be properly separated and installed in such a way as to minimize frequency bleed over.
  All radio equipment shall be compatible with the Motorola response radios currently in use.

2.  A computer network shall be included with multiple data jack locations to support operations within the ICPT and for connection to the Shipyard computer network(s).  All computer equipment shall be furnished by the government.  Trailer will be equipped with appropriate wiring to support this network. 

3.  A telephone network with punch down board shall be included in the ICPT to support the use of up to twenty five (25) independent telephone lines.  This network shall include multiple jack locations to support the use of these telephones at various locations in the ICPT.  Additionally, this functionality shall include a pre-staged cable of sufficient capacity and length stored on a reel to support connection to the base shore telephone system.

4.
  Access to (e.g. antenna & wiring) satellite telephone and internet connectivity shall be provided for within the ICPT as a back-up capability to the land based shore service connections.

5.  Response operations use sound powered phones during response to shipboard casualties.  A cable and connections to establish these communications will be provided.  This cable shall be stored on a reel to support connection to a ship.

Electronics / Data Processing

1.  The use of Touch Screen Smart Boards is desired at several locations within the ICPT.  These smart boards will allow for ready access to and capture of data during operations.

2.  The capability to record / transmit video of the casualty from a mast mounted video camera shall be considered.

3.
  A common system architecture (e.g., cat 6) shall be utilized between the electronics and communications equipment to provide for additional flexibility of services within the ICPT.

This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. It is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. 

NAICS Code

The NAICS Code for this requirement is 336214, Travel Trailer and Camper Manufacturing , and the Size Standard is 500 Employees.

Anticipated Contract

The proposed contract is anticipated to be a fixed-price type contract. The contract will utilize firm fixed price (FFP) pricing.

<DESC>Statement of Work
Peer Support Certification Training
Office of Mental Health/ Employee Education System (EES)


1.	PURPOSE.   The purpose of this contract is to provide training and certification for non-certified peer support apprentices and peer support technicians.  VHA's Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Services Section in the Office of Mental Health Services (OMHS) has been charged with developing and approving peer support certification training services.  The Director of Peer Support Services for the Office of Mental Health Services is responsible for the program of peer support in VA's mental health programs.  

2.	BACKGROUND.  Peer support services were formally initiated in VHA mental health programs in 2006 with funding that enhanced mental health programs with recovery-oriented services, and a Director of Peer Support Services in OMHS was hired in 2007. Prior to the passage of Public Law 110-387 in October 2008, peers hired in VHA were not required to be certified to provide peer services. The passage of this law as well as Public Law 111-163 (passed in May 2010) not only required that peer support specialists in VHA be certified by an appropriate peer certification program but also provided authorization for VHA to develop a national contract with a not-for-profit agency to provide training for Veterans to provide peer support services. Peer support services are an essential component of transforming VHA's mental health programs to the recovery model and are required by VHA Handbook 1160.01, Uniform Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics.  A contract for this purpose is currently in force with the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, but expires due to need to expand the scope and have open competition for additional training. The current contract for 160 employees is VA741-13-C-0019. 

3.	Objectives.   The contracting vendor will provide current and future VA employed peer support apprentices or technicians or with training, resulting in their being fully prepared to take a certification examination.   This training must cover the competencies and skills for peer support services in mental health programs as defined by OMHS and described in the Specific Tasks and Deliverables Section below.    

4.	Scope.  The Contractor who is awarded this contract must provide the required labor and materials to develop and present a peer support specialist training and certification program for VA employees nationwide, for approximately 340 employees. Contractors shall follow the existing quality control plan that contains, at a minimum, a description of the inspection system to cover all services including areas to be inspected and the schedule of inspection, a description of the methods used for identifying and preventing defects in the quality of services and a description of the records to be kept to document inspections and any corrective/preventive actions taken in advance of the award of the contract.

Services: Peer support certification training (including didactic, experiential, and multimedia modalities) covering the 34 competencies VHA has designated as required for peer support staff are identified in the Specific Tasks and Deliverables section below. Some competencies marked with an asterisk in the list of mandatory tasks must have an experiential component that includes role playing and provides for demonstration of those skills in order to establish competencies. 

Training for the competencies that do not require the face-to-face experiential modality may be provided through in-person training or through completion of workbook materials, manuals, or online learning conducted prior to the experiential training.  Attachment  (A) has been included which gives details of guidelines and expectations VHA will use to evaluate the responses to this proposal.  Attachment (E), VA Reviewer Rating Tool to Evaluate Peer Support Certification Training RFPs, is the actual tool the VA review team will use in evaluating submitted proposals.  Completion of Attachment (D) is recommended but optional, and may be submitted with required deliverables.

An examination that demonstrates mastery of the peer support competencies and skills must be administered by the contractor in two segments.  A performance based segment that demonstrates mastery of the competencies and skills learned in the face-to-face training (those marked below with an asterisk under "Task One") will be administered during the face-to-face training.  A second segment of the examination will be administered to measure the competencies and skills that do not require a face-to-face experiential modality after completion of the training or at a later time agreed upon and acceptable to VHA for administration at the student participant's home facility.. Peer support staff must pass the examination with a score determined by and agreeable to the vendor and OMHS.

5.	Specific Tasks and Deliverables.  If for any reason, any deliverable cannot be delivered on time according to the below schedule, the contractor shall provide a written explanation three days prior to the due date to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  This written transmittal shall include a firm commitment of when the work shall be completed.  This transmittal to the COR shall cite reasons for the delay, and the impact on the overall project.  The COR will review collaboratively with the program office and facts and issue a response in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.  Unless otherwise specified an electronic copy shall be placed in the designated CBO SharePoint site or other CBO-designated site.  Specifically, the contractor shall:
5.1	Task One.  The contractor shall develop a plan for training to thoroughly cover the following 34 competencies.  Competencies that must have an experiential performance based modality of training that includes role-playing or other demonstration of skills, observed and critiqued by the trainer, are marked with an asterisk in the list below.  The contractor may include other topics/competencies in the training which they deem appropriate or are required by their state's peer support certification training approval process.

<DESC>McAfee ESM is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) product.  The McAfee ESM is a high performance system capable of handling tens of thousands of data events per second, it collects and correlates security information from firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems, routers, servers and other mapped devices and presents a common correlated threat picture for use by security personnel. The managed composite display and correlated security event logs of all networks is a key advantage in cyber security situation awareness. The aforementioned licenses enable use of McAfee ESM to provide real-time visibility into network, database, and application activity on the Project Manager (PM), Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1 network.  <br>  <br> We request that sources capable of meeting the Government's technical requirements provide a white paper of no more than 25 pages about its products and their ability to provide a situational and risk-aware SIEM system that is interoperable with the current software utilized in the PM WIN-T Increment 1 suite of Network Operations systems. <br>

This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS) NEXRAD spare parts program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO. The TR Limiter is provided by Communication &amp; Power Industries (CPI) Beverly Microwave, Inc. (BMI) and is a subcontractor for the Baron Services Dual Polarization contract. The part number is manufactured solely by CPI/BMI specifically for use in the Dual Pole Installation. The Limiter provides the protection for receivers. It provides internal analysis to ensure equipment is not running out of the specified guidelines. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The unique characteristics and physical form of this item makes it the only acceptable part. Because the design is the property of CPI/BMI, the Government does not have access to the specific design features. The Government has no design rights to the item and does not possess the drawings that specify the parts. NWS performed a market research and found there are no substitute part numbers or manufacturers identified through the search. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, furnish detailed information concerning their capabilities to provide these products. Interested firms must submit support documents if providing or proposing to provide other than the specified part number referenced above that meet the same fit, form and function as the specified part number. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 757-664-3622 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999. This announcement will close on Monday, June 12, 2013 at 1:00 PM CST. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.12), Patuxent River, MD is posting this sources sought to determine the interest in this requirement and determine if that interest warrants a full and open competition or a set-aside to The U.S, Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS), for Variable Stability System (VSS) designed and built by Veridian Engineering - Flight Research Group (VE-FRG, now Calspan) as an integral part of the Helicopter Flight Mechanics flight syllabus since 1992. The VSS shall allow the in flight demonstration of the effects of varying stability and control parameters about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes of the aircraft. The variation in flying qualities shall be accomplished by sensing control and flight variables and using those signals to modify the input made to the upper controls using the production aircraft, limited authority, Smart ElectroMechanical Actuator (SEMA) series actuators provided for the pitch, roll, and directional channels. It is required that the system be designed such that one or all axes (Pitch, Roll, Yaw) may be selectively under VSS control.</p>
<p>ALL LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE INTERESTED SHOULD SEND IN A CAPABILITY STATEMENT. The attached draft statement of work provides additional information about the required tasking.

<DESC>U.S. Naval Test Pilot School<br />UH-72 Variable Stability Helicopter Program
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The U.S, Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) trains and graduates qualified engineering test pilots, flight test officers and flight test engineers to conduct test and evaluation at the Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) and other activities, The USNTPS had been operating 2 SH-60B Seahawk helicopters equipped with a Variable Stability System (VSS) designed and built by Veridian Engineering - Flight Research Group (VE-FRG, now Calspan) as an integral part of the Helicopter Flight Mechanics flight syllabus since 1992. Although the system itself has been highly reliable, the SH-60B host airframes were retired.<br />To replace this capability, USNTPS is rehosting the VSS capability in two of their fleet of 5 UH-72 Lakota aircraft. This will allow USNTPS to retain this excellent teaching capability and also provide an opportunity to update the existing capability with new generation hardware and software. The UH-72 Lakota's are derivatives of the Eurocopter EC145 and are operated under a NAVAIR Flight Clearance which is heavily based on an FAA Type Certification to retain parts pool commonality with the commercial fleet. FAA approval for flight of the VSS system equipment installed in the UH-72A will be required at the field level at a minimum. Operational use of the UH-72 using the VSS gain varying capability shall be covered by a NAVAIRSYSCOM Flight Clearance.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE</p>
<p>This statement of work describes the level of effort required to modify two host UH-72 aircraft to allow in flight variation and monitoring of parameters set forth in paragraph 4.0 by an instructor/safety pilot occupying the right seat of the aircraft. The overall system shall be composed of the following major system elements:</p>
<p>&bull; Sensors (VSS system may utilize existing UH-72 sensors if desired)<br />&bull; VSS Computer<br />&bull; Safety Pilot- System Interface<br />&bull; Interface from VSS computer to UH-72 ship actuators<br />&bull; Safety Trip System<br />&bull; Data Recording System</p>
<p>The aircraft modification should incorporate the maximum amount of modularity practicable such that the system could be most easily removed and installed in another model UH-72 at some future date. The host helicopter will be GFE. Installation and acceptance testing will be accomplished at The Contractor facility. System testing, development and syllabus development will be at NAS Patuxent River, MD. USNTPS flight crews will perform the flight checkout, with assistance from the contractor pilots as required.</p>
<p>3.0 GENERAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Similar VSS modifications to two USNTPS SH-60B aircraft were performed under contracts No. N00421-91-R-0127 dated 7 July 1991 and contract No. N00421-91-C- 0127 dated Oct, 1991.</p>
<p>4.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The contractor shall determine the technical approach, cost, and schedule, and perform the following tasks to modify the existing UH-72 flight control system to include a variable stability system capability.</p>
<p>General VSS Requirements</p>
<p>The VSS shall allow the in flight demonstration of the effects of varying stability and control parameters about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes of the aircraft. The variation in flying qualities shall be accomplished by sensing control and flight variables and using those signals to modify the input made to the upper controls using the production aircraft, limited authority, Smart ElectroMechanical Actuator (SEMA) series actuators provided for the pitch, roll, and directional channels. It is required that the system be designed such that one or all axes (Pitch, Roll, Yaw) may be selectively under VSS control. Axes not under VSS control shall use the production control laws for the selected AFCS Mode.</p>
<p>The features that can be varied shall include:</p>
<p>&bull; Rate feedback (Damping, 3 axes, pitch, roll, yaw)<br />&bull; Attitude feedback<br />&bull; Forward path gain (Sensitivity, 3 axes)<br />&bull; Rate and control coupling to 3 axes and from all 4 axes<br />&bull; Time delay, 3 axes<br />&bull; Forward path lead and lag (1st order, 3 axes)</p>
<p>4.1 Sensor Suite</p>
<p>The sensors shall include position sensors for the cockpit controls (cyclic, pedals, collective), attitudes (Euler angles), body rates (pitch, roll, yaw), accelerations nz and ny, angle of attack and sideslip angle. The sensor suite shall be modular such that it can be most easily be transportable from the host modified UH-72 airframe to another UH-72 and shall be compatible with the currently installed USNTPS instrumentation package. The quality and sample rate of the sensor signals must of a high enough quality and sample rate to feed them forward or back to safely and effectively alter the Stability and Control characteristics. The system may use production sensors and their data signals if they are of sufficient quality and sample rate.</p>
<p>4.2 VSS Computers and Electrical Power</p>
<p>The computer system that controls the VSS selected features and variation parameters shall be selected to be reliable in a helicopter vibration environment. Also, compactness is highly desired as space available in the H-72 cabin is somewhat limited. Onboard cooling other than ambient airflow is not available. Specific data on the computer environment and space available will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>Power source shall be 28 VDC or ll5V 400Hz. For non-VSS flights, the sensor suite and recording capability shall be capable of powering up without powering the entire VSS system.</p>
<p>Actuators <br />The VSS shall use the existing UH-72 series actuators. The transfer of actuator control from the production flight control computers to the VSS computer shall be done without objectionable transients. Once disengaged from VSS control, the SEMA(s) shall revert to the selected production AFCS mode.</p>
<p>4.3 Safety Pilot (SP) to VSS Interface</p>
<p>Interfaces from the VSS to the SP shall consist of displays and controls which perform the following functions:<br />&bull; SEMA Actuator Position Indicators<br />&bull; SEMA Actuator Saturation Indications<br />&bull; SEMA Actuator Transfer Fail Indications<br />&bull; VSS System On/Off Indication<br />&bull; Safety Trip Status<br />&bull; SEMA Actuator Engaged Status<br />&bull; Axis Selection<br />&bull; Feature Selection<br />&bull; Gain Selection</p>
<p>Existing USNTPS instrumentation package control panels and displays (with perimeter softkeys) shall be utilized to the greatest extent practicable. Controls for changing existing configurations and system engagement and disengagement shall be accessible without the safety pilot removing his hands from the primary flight controls to the maximum extent practical. Functional reach data for the safety pilot will be provided by the government. The system shall provide a mechanical or software locking capability to prevent unqualified crew activation of the installed VSS system.</p>
<p>4.4 Safety Trip System</p>
<p>The safety trip system shall consist of an automatic mode and a manual mode. The VSS helicopter shall revert to the selected production AFCS condition following a trip and shall fade to that condition in a smooth fashion to avoid abrupt inputs to the upper flight controls. The automatic mode shall have the following inputs for processing automatic trips:</p>
<p>VSS digital computer "watchdog"<br />Pitch SEMA Servo Error<br />Roll SEMA Servo Error<br />Yaw SEMA Servo Error<br />Mast Moment Exceedance<br />Spare input capability for future identified safety trips</p>
<p>There shall be a switch to manually disengage the VSS on the flight control inceptors for both the safety pilot and evaluation pilot. An audio tone and light shall be activated when a trip of either type occurs.</p>
<p>4.5 Data Recording System</p>
<p>The host aircraft will already have a data recording system installed. The VSS shall provide an ARINC 429 data stream containing VSS unique parameters (gains, selected features, safety trip codes, etc) for recording by the existing system. The contractor shall provide an interface control document (ICD) of the provided bus. The Navy will provide the parameter details on the data required in a separate document.</p>
<p>5.0 TASK DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>5.1 TASK 1 - Design Fabrication, and Installation</p>
<p>System design, fabrication and installation of the VSS in the UH-72 shall include:</p>
<p>5.1.1 Design of the system to provide the functions and features described in paragraph 4.0. Design Reviews shall be utilized as required by the SETR process.<br />5.1.2 Fabrication of the system sensors, computers, wiring, controls, displays, and electronic enclosures.<br />5.1.3 Installation of the system in a USNTPS provided UH-72 helicopter.<br />5.1.4 Provide support documentation for the VSS equipment in the form of<br />5.1.4.1 Detailed functional block diagrams of signal flow through the VSS.

Amazon is the only known source that operates compatible servers, network configuration, and sufficient bandwidth to permit the operation of CHINFOs asset management system, app distribution server, and unique workflow requirements with a geographically dispersed backbone and data centers.
  Furthermore, CHINFO has invested in significant information assurance documentation, system development, network engineering and file transfers such that selecting another manufacturer would necessitate reconstruction and population of the system with a cost to the government that would exceed the value of the requested contract.  Transition to a new manufacturer would also require a new accreditation process resulting in significant additional expenses.  The cloud computing service offered by Amazon is both the most technically advantageous and the most cost-efficient in that it enables CHINFO to avoid both the delay and the major expense of adaptation and recertification of the central processing system.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 511210.

EMC Corporation has been determined to be the only acceptable source for the required services.
  EMC is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the ERoom and ERoom Database Server products.  EMC has maintained this system since its installation and has authorized no other vendor to offer service or maintenance for the system.  It is essential that the system be serviced and maintained by an authorized agent as variance from the maintenance requirements of the system would likely result in eventual system failure.  The system is used daily for communication, coordination, transmission of Navy Imagery, and workflow management by public affairs officers worldwide.  EMC Corporation is therefore judged to offer the best value to the Navy for the required service.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 511210.
  All responses may be emailed to Joseph Haviland at joseph.haviland1@navy.mil and reference number N001890131955 no later than 1500 EST on 21 June 2013.

<CONTACT>Michael T. Fischer, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014430728, Email Michael.Fischer@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Program Support Center/ Strategic Acquisition Service, intends to award a Sole Source Time and Material/Labor hour contract to William E. Gray Consulting LLC. for management consulting services for the OMHA ECAPE project.
<p>This notice of intent is in accordance with FAR 5.203 and is not a request for proposals or quotations; however, any challenges to this sole source must be received in writing and sent to Michael.Fischer@psc.hhs.gov to be considered by the Government for the purpose of determining whether or not to compete the requirement. Challenges must include information sufficient to enable the Government to make a determination that an equivalent service exists which would meet the Government's needs as stated herein.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>In order to deliver excellent service in the face of rapidly growing workloads, the Office of Medicare and Health Appeals (OMHA) needs to take advantage of the efficiencies that electronic processing can produce. To accomplish this, the Department of Health and Human Services, OMHA intends to acquire a stable, responsive, user-friendly configurable system with functionality that fully supports their business processes and allows them to work efficiently in a fully electronic environment. The new system will be called the Electronic Case Adjudication and Processing Environment (ECAPE.)</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to acquire a contract that provides OMHA with a full range of expert advisory services for ECAPE. OMHA requires a contract with an organization that is able to immediately provide substantive support in the development and implementation of ECAPE. The organization will provide expert advisory services on industry standards and the latest technology. It is critical that the organization be capable of providing sound guidance on procuring an IT solution that meets OMHA's unique business process requirements. This support will be required for the duration of the project.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>There is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be met by William E. Gray Consulting, LLC due to their work already completed on OMHA's ECAPE project, in addition to their unique experience in successfully delivering an electronic processing system and supporting an adjudicatory business process. The principals of William E. Gray Consulting, LLC have extensive familiarity with administrative appeals processes, including the Medicare appeals process. In addition, since they have been involved with the ECAPE project for over a year they serve as technical experts and are able to provide immediate expert advice on business process requirements, implementation, <br />interfaces, architecture, and acquisition. Additionally, the principals of William E. Gray Consulting, LLC have extensive knowledge of the Administrative Law Process.</p>
<p>The principals of William E. Gray Consulting, LLC are able to meet the required ECAPE timeframes. They have completed substantial work on the ECAPE development effort. Accordingly, they are the only consultants that will not have a steep learning curve, thus ensuring that OMHA can meet its acquisition milestones - including publishing the RFP within 60 days of receipt of funding. <br />Bringing on a new organization with new staff would require familiarizing them with the ECAPE work completed over the past year and OMHA's complex appeals process. This would result in a lengthy learning period, and existing OMHA staff would be required to mentor the new organization which reduces the amount of time spent on implementation activities. This would result in significant delays that could jeopardize the entire project. It is critical that OMHA meet ECAPE's project milestones, which are extremely tight.</p>
<p>Bringing a new organization onboard and familiarizing them with ECAPE and OMHA's complex business process would cause significant delays. The HHS OPDIV's roles for systems interfaces, intra-agency cost obligations, and our unique business/ technical/ legal requirements are multilayered. It would require a significant investment from staff to ensure the new organization is brought up to speed.</p>
<p>Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with issuance of a solicitation to William E. Gray Consulting LLC.</p>

The FAR citation is 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). <br>  <br> The NAICS code for this action is 541712. <br>  <br> This requirement is for a rapid transfusiontransmitted disease detection (RT2D2) device pre-Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) package to the FDA. Upon review of the IDE package, FDA determined that the proposed clinical trial must be expanded, which will require the drawing and testing of approximately four thousand more specimens than were initially proposed. Both the newly required and originally planned specimen testing must be accomplished with the same RT2D2 device, <br> which is only available from MedMira as it is still under development. <br>  <br> USAMRAA requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the SAM and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a DUN & Bradstreet Number.

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>Size: Pasture area needs to accommodate 30 - 40 head of stock. Stock maybe split into separate smaller herds. The Forest Service to negotiate herd's size, and/or split of animals.</p>

<p>Location: The pasture is required to be within 200 miles of Kalispell city center.</p>
<p>Other Stock: The Forest Service would need to approve in advance, placing government stock with other stock - considerations include total number of animals being pastured together, type of stock (boarding with lots of mares could cause issues in a herd of 30 - 40) current health of other animals, and the vaccinations care of the other stock.</p>

Daily supplemental feeding of oats or barley or a combination of dry 3-way <br />(oats, barley and corn) for 1 - 5 head of stock along with grazing and hay support. <br />The Government will determine those animals that will need to be in this category due to age, weight and ability to keep weight on. This is reflected in Bid Items 1.2 and 2.2.</p>

<p>There could be a portion or all that would be pastured during November and May. Charges for November and May will be calculated on a perentage of the actual time on pasture for the month. (Example if delivered on the 15 of the month then the government would be billed for 50 % of the month.) If the animal is delivered on November 20, (30 days in November) 30 - 20 days equals 10 days on pasture. The Government will be billed the percent of 10 days/30days= 33% monthly rate).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>FAR 52.236-7 Permits and Responsibilities (NOV 1991)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any Federal, State, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and sub factors described below. This acquisition is based on "best value" source selection using full tradeoff source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, and FAR 15.101-1, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Cost/Price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors, and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical and/or overall business approach and/or past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Best value means that the Government will perform a cost/technical trade-off analysis such that the proposals will be assessed for how well the Offeror's proposal meets the solicitation requirements and the risks associated with the Offeror's approach. Business judgment will be exercised in selecting the most advantageous alternative to the Government, considering both the technical merit and costs of proposals. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations, and certifications, and technical requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Evaluation Factors are listed in descending order of importance with Factor 1 (Technical Capability) being most important, Factor 2 (Past Performance) of slightly less importance, and Factor 3 (Cost/Price) of least importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Technical Capability and Past Performance Factors, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost or price factor; however, the Cost/Price Factor will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">THIS IS THE REQUEST FOR FORMAL COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Government exercises its unilateral right to award with or without discussions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Government reserves the right to award without discussions, this may be your only opportunity to provide information in support of your proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You are advised that any non-concurrence to contract terms and conditions, contract attachments or required supporting information in your proposal may not be subject to discussion or negotiation, may be interpreted as a conditional offer, and may result in your proposal being considered unacceptable. The anticipated award date is July 2013.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You are also required to state that your proposal may be accepted at any time until 90 calendar days from the due date of the proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?
    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

<DESC>Amendment 3 - to Request for Proposal (RFP) D13PS00230 Oracle Federal Financial System Support for FMLoB IBC.
This amendment addresses vendor concerns specific to the Orgnaizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) and extends the due date for Proposals. Only documents that have been revised as a result of changes to the RFP at this amendment are attached.  Changes are reflected in orange highlight for amendment 3 revisions.
Summary of Changes: 1. Due date to sumit the RFP is changed from June 28, 2013 to July 12, 2013. 
2. The following statement has been removed from Section 52.212-1 and the Government PWS;
"A contractor who currently supports a non-DOI Financial Management Federal Shared Service provider in a prime or teaming, subcontractor relationship, is not eligible to propose on this requirement as its relationship with another Federal Shared Service Provider creates a significant organizational conflict of interest to the DOI FMLoB."
and REPLACED WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT:

NOTICE OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST Contractors are advised to be aware of the heightened possibility of a potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) due to the nature of this requirement.
This notice applies to contractors who currently are providing any one or more of the services described in the Government Performance Work Statement entitled "Oracle Federal Financial System Support for the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB)  A Shared Service Provider, Interior Business Center (IBC)." 
This applies whether a contractor is providing these services (a) directly to Financial Management Federal Shared Service Providers (SSP) or (b) to Federal sector commercial entities supporting such SSPs. 
This applies to contractors (a) proposing under this requirement in a prime contractor role or (b) that will be proposed under this requirement in a teaming and/or subcontractor role. 
Any contractor providing services as noted above shall detail the services provided, the entity(ies) to whom they are being provided, and all other pertinent circumstances and provide an OCI mitigation plan.  The OCI mitigation plan must assure IBC that there is an absolute and rigorous separation between IBC and the non-IBC SSP or commercial entity.  Based upon information provided and the OCI mitigation plan, the Government will determine whether the apparent OCI can be mitigated with respect to the services being provided directly or indirectly to a non-IBC SSP.
Any contractor NOT providing the services described above, are not required to submit an OCI mitigation plan at the submission of the RFP.
Further, all contractors must submit a Sensitive Information Protection plan designed to ensure that all IBC- sensitive information is protected against potential disclosure to competitive Federal and commercial FMLoB providers.
The acceptability determination by the contracting officer of an offeror's OCI Mitigation Plan and Sensitive Information Protection Plan (required in every case) will be performed at step 1 based on Go/No-Go criteria only of the multi-step process.
Note: As published in the base RFP document, additional OCI terms and conditions are found at Section 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Clauses, custom clause #3.
3. The Go/No Matrix has been updated to include the OCI Mitigation Plan and the Sensitive Informaiton Protection Plan.
Updated and Attached Documents: 1. SF 30 Amendment 3
2. 52.212-1 (A3) Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items
3. 52.212-1 (A3) Attachment 4 Go/No Go Matrix (pdf and word version attached)

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B. DESTINATION  (NOV 1991) <BR> <BR>Sellers must comply with all terms and conditions as outlined in the attached solicitation. <BR> <BR>WIDE AREA WORKFLOW PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS <BR> <BR>AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS <BR> <BR>TIME OF DELIVERY <BR> <BR>REP BY CORP REGARDING AN UNPAID DELIQUENT TAX LIABILITY OR FELONY CONVICTION - FY 2013 APPROPRIATIONS. <BR> <BR>REP BY CORP REGARDING AN UNPAID DELINQUENT TAX LIABILITY. <BR> <BR>

B.2  STATEMENT OF WORK

Title: Patient Centered Care New Employee Orientation Program
Introduction and Scope of Work
The federal government, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Veterans Health Administration are engaged in critical organization-wide initiatives to fulfill public service missions while reducing costs to US taxpayers.   This challenge is compounded by public sector healthcare organizations which face both the regulatory and accountability challenges of government agencies and also the expectations and innovation forces of private sector medicine.  The Orlando VA Medical Center has aggressively engaged this mandate by authorizing a series of strategic priorities to better serve Veteran patients while ensuring organizational capabilities and efficiency.  This mandate and the strategic challenges associated with it require new capabilities of all employees.  Our staff are now faced with the challenge to act with transformative results-to transform what will be one of the region's largest integrated healthcare system into the very best-number one in quality, satisfaction, staff engagement and efficiency.
 This requested work focuses on Customer Service development- The Orlando VA is seeking a contractor capable of developing and implementing a Patient Centered Care (PCC) New Hire Onboarding Program for the Orlando VA Medical Center that prepares each new employee (clinical and non-clinical) to deliver care that is personalized, proactive and patient-driven by developing an effective workplace environment through the implementation of a comprehensive Customer Service development program. The performance period of this contract is twelve (12) months.
Three Guiding Assumptions
A. The way to show that a Patient Centered Care culture is advancing is to show that a proper onboarding program impacts key measures of performance. This approach supports the mission of VISN, to balance rigor with relevance in everything we do.
B. Leadership development linked to a strategic initiative to be the employer of choice that matters to our healthcare system, will be monitored, reinforced and supported to the extent the strategic initiative is monitored, reinforced and supported.
C.  Co-design between vendor and Orlando VAMC will increase the likelihood that deliverables conform to facility requirements and environment.  This will insure that deliverables take into adequate consideration the users and context in a rapidly changing environment (e.g. work place innovations, leadership infrastructure, federal mandates, etc.).
Requirements
Program Development
The contractor shall provide a proposal for a program that shall provide an integrated set of patient centered care educational experiences, on-the-job experiences, personal action plans, new hire "buddies", peer and patient feedback, and coaching which take place throughout an employee's first year of employment with the Medical Center.  The contractor's proposal shall include the VA's core values (ICARE), PCC principles and VHA's six principles (patient centered care, team based work, data driven/evidence based, prevention/population health, providing value, and continuously improving).

The contractor's proposal shall include curriculum that includes and supports PCC Principles as follows:
"	Honor Veteran expectations of safe, high quality and accessible health care
"	Enhance the quality of human interactions and therapeutic alliances
"	Solicit and respect Veteran values, preferences and needs
"	Empower Veterans through information and education
"	Provide physical comfort and pain management
"	Provide emotional and spiritual support
"	Encourage involvement of family and friends
"	Support and sustain an engaged work force as key to improving patient centered care

2.1.1 New Employee Training Program 
2.1.1.1 The contractor's proposal shall demonstrate a program that shall support the VHA strategic goal of providing Veterans with personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care by creating a new hire onboarding experience that fulfills the promise made to our new hires during the recruiting and selection process of a transformed VHA.  It is essential that the sum of experiences during each new hire's first year is a validation and affirmation of VA's core values and VHA principles.  It is also important that this onboarding experience build the commitment to VHA of every new employee who embodies the patient-centered culture.  We anticipate that the onboarding experience may lead a small number of new employees to decide that this new culture is not for them.  The goal of the new hire onboarding program shall be to learn, practice, receive feedback and coaching, and in some cases re-learn the values, attitudes, behaviors and competencies necessary for patient-centered care.  The success of this program shall be measured by the patient-centered values, attitudes and behaviors demonstrated by our new clinical and non-clinical employees and the retention rates for these valued employees at the end of their first year with VHA.
2.1.1.2 Program Implementation:  The contractor's proposal shall address an implementation plan that shall  support the Orlando VA Medical Center's strategic goal of successfully opening our new flagship Medical Center, which has been designed from the ground-up with patient-centered principles, by onboarding a care team of more than 3000 clinical and non-clinical employees and volunteers who embody the practices and culture of patient-centered care.  The new hire onboarding program will be used initially with a cohort of approximately 1000 new employees.  But we anticipate that the program shall have applicability to the 2000+ current employees who will transfer to and "re-onboard" with the opening of the new facility.
2.1.2 Program Objectives
The contractor shall develop and implement a Customer Service Patient Centered New Patient Orientation program that aligns with the medical center's priority of not only equips employees at the onset of employment at the Orlando VAMC but also focuses providing patient centered educational experiences throughout the first year of employment. Specific objectives include:
-	Assess current new hire onboarding practices and experiences at the Orlando VA Medical Center
-	Perform a gap assessment and benchmarking of current new hire onboarding practices with industry best practices and the VHA Core Values and Principles we are seeking to embody in every new employee  
-	In collaboration with the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT),  and VHA Leadership and Workforce Development , conduct sessions to reimagine and redesign the new hire onboarding experience at the Orlando VAMC
-	Develop new hire onboarding program elements, milestones and outcome measures
-	Document the new hire onboarding program so that it is repeatable and transferrable to other VISNs and Medical Centers
-	Implement the new hire onboarding program with a cohort of new hires (clinical and non-clinical employees) at the Orlando VA Medical Center
-	Monitor and evaluate the outcomes from the new hire onboarding program
-	Develop a series of Monthly and Quarterly Status Reports to review the progress of the program implementation against the agreed upon milestones and outcomes. 
-	Document lessons learned and making refinements to the program for future cohorts, as well as national dissemination to other VISNs and Medical Centers

<p>This announcement constitutes a Formal Synopsis for the Tinker Air Force Base, F117-PW-100 Engine Overhaul and Supply Chain Management (SCM) program.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) will award one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Air Force will acquire this requirement through an Air Force Source Selection. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a FAR Part 12 IDIQ contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) line items. The awarded contract will consist of one three-year basic ordering period and four one-year incentive option periods.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be accomplished under NAICS Code 336412 and its applicable size standard. This acquisition is not a small business set aside.</p>
<p>Description of services: The Air Force requires overhaul and depot supply chain management (SCM) of F117-PW-100 (F117) engines to ensure serviceable, ready-to-install, spare engines are available to support Serviceable Propulsion Systems (SPS) and War Readiness Engines (WRE) levels. The overhaul effort is comprised of key logistics and maintenance processes to include engine receipt, induction, disassembly, inspection, required maintenance, reassembly, test, transportation, and packaging. The SCM effort consists of forecasting, repairing, acquiring, stocking, storing, issuing, and transporting all the parts necessary to support F117 depot overhaul.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at http://www.fbo.gov. Solicitation requests can be submitted to Mary Skaggs via email at mary.skaggs@tinker.af.mil. <br /><br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Bragg (MICC-FB), North Carolina intends to procure LP Gas as a supply acquisition - not a service acquistion.  MICC-FB has a requirement for a contractor to provide bulk propane to be delivered to approximately 122 Government-owned propane tanks located on Fort Bragg, Camp MacKall, Pope and Simmons Army Airfield, North Carolina. The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish a requirements type contract with a five (5) year ordering period.  It is the Government's intent to order approximately 350,000 gallons of propane each year (1,750,000.00 GALLONS over the conceptual 5-yr ordering period), approximately 29,166 gallons a month, with a two (2)-hour expected delivery timeframe. The contractor is expected to refill the Government-owned propane tanks, which range in size from 57 gallons to 36,000 gallon tanks on a monthly basis.   <br>   This requirement was determined to be classified under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 325120 with a size standard of 1000 Employees.     <br>  <br>   This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) Solicitation. There will be no public bid opening.  <br>    <br>  It is anticipated that an IFB will be posted electronically on or about 15 June 2013 to the Federal Business Opportunities webpage at http://www.fbo.gov. Paper copies will not be available. Once the IFB Solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon all interested parties to review this site frequently for any update/amendments to any and all documents.

There is NO fee to register for this site.  Entities may register at no cost directly from their webpage at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.   <br>  This Pre-Solicitation Notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid preparation costs.  Questions concerning this acquisition will be allowed after the official posting of the IFB.  All questions shall be directed toward Contract Specialist, Khristina M. Matthews at khristina.m.matthews.civ@mail.mil and Contracting Officer, Anna M. Walker at anna.m.walker.civ@mail.mil.

The ID has obtained FDA clearance for IVD diagnostic assays validated with oligonucleotide probes that contain specific chemistries.</p>
<p>The Government will perform formal on-site inspection of vendor facility during the manufacturing of sample probes. The purpose of the inspection is to confirm that proposing offerors meet or exceed FDA requirements for manufacture of IVD quality reagents in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Quality System (QS) regulations. Compliance with GMP-QS regulations is an absolute vendor requirement for consideration of an award.</p>
<p>Vendors who have been determined to meet FDA requirements for manufacture of IVD quality reagents will be requested to produce three (3) small manufacturing lots of oligonucleotide primers and for inspection and acceptance or rejection by the government. The purpose of this evaluation to verify that the manufacturer's product can consistently meet the CDC's design specification, operate functionally within the CDC test system, and adhere to the CDC's quality process requirements and timeline.</p>
<p>Vendors found capable of manufacturing the required products IAW agency specifications will be eligible for award of&nbsp;an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantities (IDIQ) contract for production of future agency requirements. Anticipated award date is currently on or about 20 Sep 2013.</p>

All persons entering the main gate (whether driving or walking), will be required to show Federal or State government issued ID to the guard at the gate, who will direct them to the Visitors Center (Building 25). At the Visitor Center, each person will be required to present either a driver's license or Federal or State government issued ID. IMPORTANT: Drivers must also provide the license tag number of the vehicle they are driving to obtain a DSCC Temporary Vehicle Registration. Only those who are on the Registration Listing we have on file for that particular forum will be processed for access. Once you have been registered, you may request directions to Building 20, or use the enclosed DSCC Map. Please note the speed limit on DSCC is 15 MPH (miles per hour), unless otherwise posted.</span></p>

<p><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DISCUSSION:</strong></p>
<p>Background. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insures multifamily mortgages under a variety of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs. The Department assumes the role of mortgagee (that is, lender) under certain circumstances, including: (1) when the borrower defaults, and the FHA-insured mortgagee assigns the mortgage to HUD and files a claim or partial claim for insurance benefits; (2) when a current mortgage is assigned to HUD by the mortgagee pursuant to Section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act; (3) when a purchase money mortgage is taken back by HUD to finance the sale of property owned by HUD; or (4) when an FHA-insured or HUD-held first mortgage is restructured under the "Mark-to-Market" (or its predecessor "DEMO") program or when an outstanding insured loan is refinanced and HUD agrees to a Partial Payment of Claim (PPC) on the insured mortgage and, as a result, one or more new subordinate HUD-held mortgages are originated. Collectively, this portfolio is referred to as the HUD Held portfolio.</p>
<p>The HUD Held portfolio currently consists of approximately 3,000 loans (approximately 1,000 first mortgages and 2,000 subordinate ones). M2M and DEMO Notes total 2,400 and non-M2M/demo Notes total 600. Fewer than 10% of the M2M/demo loans are in first position; almost all are subordinate to new insured or conventional financing. Due to the Department's enforcement actions and loan sales, the HUD-&not;Held portfolio may rise to as many as 5,000 loans or fall to as few as 500 loans during a 5 year period. The average unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the first mortgage loans is approximately $2 million, with the UPBs ranging from less than $100,000 to as high as $122,000,000. Although the loans have historically remained in the HUD Held portfolio for an average length of time exceeding 15 years, the average holding period is estimated to be less than 3 years, due to HUD's loan sales and other initiatives. In addition, there are approximately 4,500 202/811 Direct Loans requiring UCC Set Up and Maintenance. Approximately 58% of the current HUD Held portfolio (exclusive of M2M/DEMO notes) is performing under the terms of the original mortgages or under the terms of a modified mortgage. Approximately 3% of the non M2M/DEMO Notes are subject to workout agreements. One or more subordinate HUD-held mortgages may be created on a project whose first mortgage has been restructured under the Mark-to-Market (or DEMO) program administered by the Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP). These new mortgages are generally "cash flow notes" on which payments are due to HUD only annually from surplus cash. There are usually no reserves or escrows with these mortgages. <br /><br />The numbers of performing loans, modifications and workouts can be expected to vary substantially during a 5 year period. The number of M2M and DEMO Notes is expected to remain fairly constant until they season enough to include in Note Sales. Properties securing these loans may be located in any of the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or Guam. Most of the properties securing these loans are multifamily apartment projects, and the remainder is mostly nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Many of the first mortgages have one or more escrow accounts associated with them (reserve for replacement, taxes, etc.).</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, HUD forecloses and becomes Mortgagee-in-Possession (MIP) or owner with respect to some of the properties in the HUD-Held portfolio. In a foreclosure sale, with the foreclosure commissioner, HUD advertises the sale, sells the property at foreclosure and transfers the property to a third-party purchaser. As MIP, HUD will manage the property. HUD also advertises and sells HUD-Owned projects. HUD usually becomes owner of a project by obtaining title at a foreclosure sale, bidding on the debt at a foreclosure sale, or accepting a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a HUD-Held loan. HUD also relocates tenants from defaulted subsidized properties where the physical condition standards are not in compliance with HUD requirements. The relocation, foreclosure, MIP and HUD-Owned projects are referred to as the Property Disposition portfolio. When HUD is MIP or owner of a project, HUD generally contracts with a property manager to manage the operation of the property. In addition, the Property Disposition (PD) Centers administer relocation contracts. It is anticipated that 15-20 relocations may come into the Property Disposition portfolio annually and remain in the portfolio approximately 6-9 months to allow sufficient time for payment of the final invoice. Currently, HUD has about 21 projects in foreclosure; there are 2 MIP properties and 0 HUD-Owned properties. During a 5 year period, it is estimated that approximately 25 to 50 foreclosure projects and 3 to 5 MIP and HUD-Owned projects will enter the Property Disposition portfolio annually, and about the same number will leave the portfolio. The length of time loans (properties) remain MIP varies substantially, but it should be assumed that loans (properties) would remain in this status for approximately one (1) year.</p>
<p>HUD requires a print ad service provider to perform print advertising for foreclosure and HUD-Owned sales. The advertising of these sales currently generates approximately 4 disbursements per week. The average multifamily property, currently in the portfolio, contains approximately 115 units. It can be estimated that properties processed as foreclosure or HUD-Owned sales will remain in the Property Disposition portfolio for approximately 12 to 24 months, although exceptions will occur. The management of the Property Disposition portfolio currently generates approximately five (5) disbursements per week. Each relocation action generates approximately two (2) disbursements per month. In conjunction with the sale of properties in the Property Disposition portfolio, HUD periodically makes Up-Front Grants or Loans to support the rehabilitation, demolition, or redevelopment of the properties. There may be a need to administer the disbursement on Up-Front Grants and Loans.</p>
<p>The Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP) (previously the Office of Multifamily Affordable Housing Assistance Restructuring or OMHAR) is responsible for conducting restructuring activities for the Department's Mark-To-Market (M2M) Program. OAHP is also responsible for processing other partial payment of claims on insured Multifamily mortgages outside of the M2M program. There is a requirement to direct questions related to M2M, DEMO Notes and Partial Payment Claims (PPC) Notes to the OAHP.</p>
<p>OAHP approves restructuring plans and manages the closing of restructurings, which includes the satisfaction of existing insured or HUD-held debt and creation of new HUD-held M2M/DEMO Notes. The service provider will generally interact directly with OAHP staff on all actions described below, except as specifically noted herein. After M2M closing, properties may include takeout financing (a new FHA-insured or conventional loan), with subordinate M2M debt, usually a M2M Mortgage Restructuring Note (MRN) and a M2M Contingent Repayment Note (CRN). The M2M Mortgage Restructuring Note can be in the primary position if there is no new takeout (currently 138). The majority of the M2M Notes are subordinate debt (currently 2127) which do not require a service provider to bill, collect and administer escrow accounts for taxes and Reserve for Replacements (reserve for replacement). Servicing and Accounting functions under the M2M and DEMO Notes should be handled in the same fashion as other HUD Notes, except for the unique billing and collection and issues caused by the nature of a surplus cash note and the relationship of the Post Closing Portfolio Management (PCPM).</p>
<p>A service organization is needed to provide Multifamily Mortgage Loan Servicing (MLS) and Accounting, Property Management, Relocation and Sales Servicing and Accounting and 202/811 Direct Loan Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Setup and Maintenance.</p>
<p>The service provider must be able to interface data with FHA Subsidiary General Ledger (FHASL). In October 2002, FHA implemented a new OMB-compliant - Off the Shelf (COTS) software package to function as the FHA Subsidiary General Ledger (FHASL). The FHASL currently operates on PeopleSoft Financial (Solaris10 Operating System). FHASL uses the US Standard General ledger chart of accounts and classification consistent with the Federal Generrally Accepted Accounting Principles (FEDGAAP) requirements and Credit Reform. With this implementation FHA now has the capability to record and track budgetary resources control expenditure against available resources, and automatically produce financial statements and other reports from the general ledger.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> Sole source justification:  Nococut DP-1 is the only known approved acceptable product for use in the guided bore machines in the Arsenal shops to date.  Use of another unproven product will contaminate through mixture of chemicals and provide an unsafe working hazard as well as resulting in unacceptable performance characteristics which would result in delays in production schedules.

<AWARDEE>HRL Laboratories, LLC, 3011 Malibu Canyon Rd., Malibu, CA 90265 US
<DESC>The Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (UPSIDE) program will create a new generation of computing structures that will enable revolutionary advances in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) processing. The objective of the proposed research effort is to demonstrate a clear path toward the implementation of non-Boolean computational models in the form of an Inference Module (IM), designed around the unique capabilities of emerging non-CMOS devices. In the system developed here, inference will be the fundamental computational building block in the same way that the Boolean logic operation is the fundamental computational block in traditional digital systems. A mixed signal CMOS implementation of the basic Inference Modules shall be developed as an intermediate step in this program. The final result of this research will be a new UPSIDE computing infrastructure, incorporating emerging non-CMOS devices, that will demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power consumption for a variety of state-of-the-art object recognition and tracking applications.
<p><br />HRL Laboratories, LLC (HRL), proposed the Revolutionary Analog-based Probabilistic Inference Devices for Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (RAPID-UPSIDE) to develop a revolutionary non-Boolean, non-CMOS nanodevice technology for power-efficient, high-speed processing of sensor data and image analysis applications that identifies and tracks a large number of targets in real-time. The RAPID-UPSIDE team has laid a strong foundation to realize this technology. HRL proposed a novel concept to perform fast distance computation between any two highdimensional vectors based on spontaneous synchronization among weakly coupled oscillators. HRL's IM module design will leverage this concept by combining banks of weakly coupled oscillators to provide an unprecedented speed advantage over Boolean approaches for probabilistic inference-making because it can perform both distance computation and search for closest matching vectors in O(1) time. The other innovative aspect of this IM design is that it also offers the most energy efficient means to make probabilistic inferences since synchronization of oscillators corresponds to a stable minimum energy state. HRL's IM based IPP (or Gold IPP) will be designed using this novel non-Boolean computational paradigm to rapidly detect and track multiple objects in a power-efficient manner.</p>

<DESC>Due to the current flood conditions on the Iowa, Cedar, Mississippi and Illinois Rivers both the state of Iowa and Illinois are requesting direct flood fight assistance from the Rock Island District (MVR), Regional Flood Fight Center (RFFC). The MVR-RFFC inventory of diesel pumps is being mobilized and deployed to many different IA/IL counties. The diesel pumps range in price from $15,000-$33,000 each. Currently there are no systems in place to maintain continuous visibility of these assets. A satellite-based asset monitoring system is needed to ensure the MVR-RFFC maintains continuous awareness of the location of each pump during this event and make certain all pumps are returned following the event.
