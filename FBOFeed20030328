The award recipient must be a for-profit company or, if the offeror is a Consortium, at least one member must be a for-profit company.  Due to limited funding, the Government reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be selected for funding.  Please note that this is an announcement to declare AFRL's intent to competitively fund dual-use technology proposals.  General information and preparation instructions for white papers and proposals are contained in the BAA.  The BAA shall remain open for one year from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  It is possible that topics may be added under this BAA during the open period.  Any change to the BAA will be accomplished through formal amendment of the announcement.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation package from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage http://www.eps.gov/ using the key word search or BAA number, or by viewing http://www2.eps.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLWRS/postdate_1.html for current AFRL postings.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of technology for a dynamic routing and packet switching optical Network that keeps Data in the Optical Domain (DOD-N).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

The objective of this program is to demonstrate technology for a dynamic routing and packet switching optical Network that keeps Data in the Optical Domain (DOD-N), thus eliminating the need for any Optical-to-Electrical-to-Optical (OEO) conversions, as well as removing other bottlenecks in the current communications systems.  The program will investigate the overall system framework for such a DOD-N network, encompassing hardware, architecture and protocols for the nodes as well as the entire network of interconnected nodes, control and management issues, and applications.  The focus of the program will be to demonstrate the physical layer technologies (hardware) that will be essential for the realization of such DOD-N networks, including a highly scalable optical data router (ODR) consisting of a chip-scale integrated optical data plane (ODP), ultimately with single or multiple monolithic chips, interfaced with a control plane that may employ traditional electronics.  A major goal of the program is to demonstrate such ODRs for different types of nodes with high throughput, multiple input/output ports, high signal integrity, high signal-to-noise ratio and high scalability.  Additional goals of the DOD-N Program are to investigate and optimize the architecture and protocols for a network of such ODRs, internal architecture and protocols for ODRs for different types of nodes, the impact of these architectures and protocols on hardware specifications and vice versa, and potential applications.  Details of the performance goals may be found in BAA 03-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

For the development of dynamic routing and packet switching networks that keep data in the optical domain, DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:


I. Optical Data Router (ODR)

The first major area of interest of the DOD-N Program is the development and demonstration of highly scalable greater than 100 terabits per second (Tb/s)) optical data routers (ODRs) for the access, edge and core nodes of a WDM network with a chip-scale integrated optical data plane (ODP), ultimately with a single or multiple monolithic chips.  The data must remain in the optical domain (no Optical-to-Electrical (O/E) or Electrical-to-Optical (E/O) conversions).  The control and management plane can employ traditional electronics, but fast management (e.g. bit by bit) at the physical layer will employ all-photonic techniques.  Interface between the optical data plane and the (electronic) control plane must be developed.  Technologies underlying an optical data router include, but are not limited to, ultra-fast photonic switch fabric, ultra-fast photonic logic for synchronization, header/label processing and other applications, multi-wavelength optical regenerators, wavelength converters, optical add-drop multiplexers, optical isolators, optical monitoring, control plane electronics, optical delay lines on a chip, and optical random access memory.  

II. Architectures for DOD-N Networks

The second major area of interest is to investigate and optimize the architecture for DOD-N optical routing and packet-switching network.  Architectures and protocols need to be investigated and optimized for the overall network connecting many ODRs, and the impact of these on the hardware specifications for the ODRs and vice versa needs to be examined for the benefit of both the areas of interest.  Architecture and protocols for the individual nodes, including communication between the optical data plane and the control plane, also need to be investigated and optimized.  Architectures with limited buffers need to be investigated.    

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The DOD-N program will consist of an 18 month Phase I effort followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (12 months).  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards totaling $40M to $60M over four years are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator or small group efforts.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Jagdeep Shah, phone: (703) 696-2253, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: jshah@darpa.mil.

<ARCHDATE>07122003
<CONTACT>Patricia Wells, 757-878-0104
<DESC>NA NA POC Ms. Pattie Wells, Contract Specialist, 757-878-0104.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), in support of the Army and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.2 Res earch & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this requirement other than this announcement.  INTRODUCTION: DARPA and the Army are currently developing an unmanned combat armed rotorcraft (UCAR) for the Objective Force.  UCAR is being developed to support a wide range o f Army missions including armed attack and reconnaissance.  The potential mission mix will most likely demand various power requirements (propulsion, accessories, mission equipment, etc.), and significant operation at part power conditions.  The mission mi x is also expected to require demanding payload / range requirements and long endurance to meet desired time-on-station.   Accordingly, the system will require an innovative fuel efficient propulsion system to meet these emerging requirements.  The Army ha s also identified a general need to develop advanced, affordable, heavy fuel propulsion capability for UAV applications to improve rotorcraft performance, to reduce cost of ownership and reduce the logistics burden on the battlefield.  Accordingly, the AAT D has developed an engine development plan to demonstrate advanced gas turbine propulsion capability with a current focus on UAV application.  This development plan is integral to a DoD, NASA, DOE initiative entitled Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine E ngines (VAATE).  The intent of this BAA is to perform a specific conceptual design of a 1000 horsepower class, innovative propulsion concept and establish its feasibility for application to emerging UCAR system configurations.  Accordingly, the offeror sha ll substantiate how the proposed concept evaluation will specifically address the need to meet variable UCAR power requirements and minimize fuel consumption for representative mission scenarios.   The offeror shall also identify how the proposed propulsio n technology and associated evaluation will support its ongoing efforts to develop an advanced turbo-propulsion plan (ATPP) for VAATE.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The overall objective of the UCAR Engine Concept Assessment is to explore innovative, fuel effici ent propulsion concepts for specific application to UCAR.  The assessment shall establish a conceptual design of the proposed innovative engine configuration and its feasibility for application to UCAR.  The assessment shall evaluate the potential performa nce, operational, and cost benefits of the innovative engine design compared to conventional propulsion approaches.  Engine performance, weight, operability, and overall life cycle cost, as a minimum, shall be assessed.  The impact of the propulsion concep t on UCAR vehicle / mission performance (e.g. payload, range, time-on-station, excess power) shall also be determined.   The offeror shall evaluate the technology maturity (e.g. technology readiness level) of the proposed concept identifying technical chal lenges / risks and the associated development plan (milestones, schedule, funding) required to achieve a readiness level appropriate for UCAR vehicle demonstration in FY08.   The offeror shall also define the potential for future technology infusion / spir al development opportunities of the proposed engine concept and how the overall concept evaluation supports the offeror’s overall turbine engine development plan for VAATE.  DELIVERABLES: All contracts shall require delivery of the following data items: a.   Interim Report: Submit in contractor format an interim report.  The report shall be submitted 90 days after contract award.  The report shall contain technica l progress during reporting period and identify any problems, technical issues or concerns that may have developed during the reporting period.  b.  Final Report Submit three copies of draft final report, in contractor’s format, within 30 days of completio n of technical effort under this contract.  Approval or recommended changes in one annotated copy will be returned within 15 days to the contractor.  Contractor shall re-submit reproducible Final Report within 15 days of receipt of annotated draft. The rep ort shall contain a detailed description of all-technical effort performed under this contract and results to include conclusions drawn and recommendations.  c.  Final Briefing will be held at Fort Eustis, VA.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  All work performed un der resulting contract(s) will be unclassified and will not require access to classified material.  A determination has been made that performance under the contract(s) will require access to and or generate technical data for which the export of will be r estricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751 et. seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award the successful firm(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084, telephone 1-800-352-3572.  OTHER SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: The winners of contracts resulting from t his solicitation may agree to provide a copy of all deliverables to the two Phase II UCAR teams.  Any proposal which limits disclosure to Phase II UCAR teams will be adversely viewed during evaluation of proposals.  The Phase II teams will be selected by D ARPA and the Army from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky.   Offerors are advised that employees of support contractors may be called upon as subject matter experts in the source selection process.  These individuals will be required t o sign non-disclosure statements and will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties.  Such firms are expressively prohibited from competing on the s ubject acquisition and from proposal scoring, ranking or recommending the selection of a source.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to these selected individuals for the limited purpose stated above.   Any information not intended for limited release to these individuals must be clearly marked and submitted segregated from other proposal material with accompanying rationale and identification of specific companies/individuals to be excluded.

<DESC>NA U.S. Army Contracting Agency, Northern Region, White Sands Contracting Division, Building 143 2nd Floor  Crozier Street, White Sands Missile Range, NM, intends to award a sole-source contract for software maintenance and support.  The software is NetBoss, which is proprietary to Harris Corporation.  It is a component of the Network Management System (NMS)of the Technical Support Network (TSN) on White Sands.  White Sands has made a substantial investment in the TSN and NMS, integrating multiple users, multi ple protocols and multiple services.  There would be a substantial duplication of a sunk cost for the Government to select another software.  There would be a substantial cost (over $2 million) for a competing contractor to absorb.

<DESC>NA Design and construct a new two story training building, one story vehicle maintenance shop and unheated storage warehouse.  The vehicle maintenance shop will house unit organizational maintenance activities and a full time Area Maintenance Support Activity  (AMSA).  The buildings will be of permanent construction with reinforced concrete foundations and floor slab, structural steel framing, masonry veneer exterior walls, built-up and standing seam metal roofs, simple, durable and efficient mechanical and ele ctrical systems.  Energy savings technology will be integrated into electrical systems.  The training and maintenance facilities will be protected with fire and intrusion detection alarm systems.  Supporting facilities include site preparation, paving, fen cing, site improvements, and extension of utilities to serve the project.  Force Protection (physical security) measures will be incorporated into design including maximum feasible standoff distance from roads, parking areas, and vehicle unloading areas. B erms, heavy landscaping, and bollards will be used to prevent access when standoff distance cannot be maintained.  This project will provide a 400 member training facility with administrative areas, classrooms, library learning center, assembly hall, kitch en, arms vault, and unit storage functions for six Army Reserve (AR)units.  The maintenance shop will provide space for training to accomplish organizational maintenance and general support (rebuilding of major logistical components) by AR units.  The unhe ated storage warehouse will provide space to store items in the unit's MTOE that do not require heat or cooling.  The project will also provide space for AR soldiers to administer and receive required physical exams as well as provide valuable training whi le reducing outside medical expenses.  The project will provide adequate parking space for military equipment park (MEP) and privately owned vehicles (POV).  The design is to be consistent with a silver rating for Sustainable Design for Military Facilities  (ETL 1110-3-491).  It is the responsibility of the design build contractor to perform a sustainable design analysis.  This is a request for proposal that will be evaluated (in descending order of importance) on (1) experience of the prime contractor, desi gn contractor and subcontractors (2) key personnel assigned to this project (3) past performance of the construction firm, design firm and subcontractors (4) price proposal and (5) technical approach.

Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE.

Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately. A "problem" is an event that interferes with the Offeror's ability to participate in the DPE and includes, but is not limited to, Internet connection and re-connection difficulties, (2) software or hardware failures, and (3) erroneous data entry errors. Offerors will have    5  minutes after the DPE goes into the "Quiet Period" status to notify the Contracting Office of any problems.

D.	AFTER THE DPE  1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only fac tor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is planning to study off-patent drugs for pediatric use information, based on the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA) process.  Federal legislation and the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) require that drugs be tested for safety and efficacy before they are approved for clinical use.  This testing must take place in all populations in which the drug will be used.  Since both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are different in immature individuals, and clinical efficacy and safety may not always be extrapolated from older patient populations to pediatric populations, studies must be conducted in the appropriate pediatric population before pediatric use information may be appropriately incorporated in the label.  The contracts will be awarded to entities that have expertise in conducting pediatric clinical trials, including qualified universities, hospitals, Contracts Research Organizations (CROs), federally funded networks (such as the Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network), and other public or private institutions.  The study sites will be called Pediatric Off-Patent Drugs Study (PODS) Centers.  Offerors responding to the RFP are requested to develop study protocols involving the use of lorazepam for sedation in pediatric populations receiving intensive care according to the specifications listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) in the RFP.  Lorazepam is commonly used for long-term sedation in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units.  However, there is limited information available about dosing, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety in pediatric patients who are sedated with lorazepam in the ICU for either short or long periods.  Additionally, the parenteral formulation of lorazepam that has been developed for adult use contains components that may be toxic to neonates.  In these clinical investigations, studies of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relations, and dosing in pediatric patients requiring long-term (> 8 hours) sedation in the intensive care unit will be conducted using randomized, active control, observer-blinded approaches.  The studies will assess safety, effectiveness, and dosing requirements in patients randomized to receive lorazepam by intermittent intravenous bolus, continuous intravenous infusion, or, if available, preservative-free midazolam by intravenous infusion, for comparison.  Patients will be followed in the study during the entire course of sedation, including periods of up to 30 days or more and for 3 days following complete discontinuation of treatment.  Investigators will recruit a broad spectrum of patients who require ICU sedation, including patients with liver failure, renal failure, cardiac failure, concomitant medications, poor prognosis and potential for prolonged (> 7 days) sedation.  It is anticipated that 300 patients must complete the studies specified in the Statement of Work, including the FDA's Written Request.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about April 10, 2003 at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All responses must be submitted on or before July 14, 2003 to:  Mrs. Mya N. Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 EXECUTIVE Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to negotiate with Capital Technology Information Services, Inc. (CTIS) for a multiple-year contract to continue the Phase II design, development, deployment and operations of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Enterprise System (DAIDS-ES), and DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

CTIS has worked for over a decade with NIH clinical research management systems, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Clinical Trials Enterprise System.  CTIS designed, developed and deployed NCI’s Adverse Event Expediting Reporting System (AdEERS), in use throughout the NCI’s cooperative clinical trials groups. To meet DAIDS’ requirement for the DAIDS-ES, CTIS is working with DAIDS to tailor and pilot DAERS, their adapted version of AdEERS.  CTIS’s institutional knowledge of the AdEERS system is crucial and essential to the successful adaptation, piloting and final deployment of the DAERS. 

This project was initiated by DAIDS for an analysis and re-engineering of business processes and the development of an enterprise wide research information management system (Phase I, Pilot Study) through a subcontract with Capital Technology Information Services (CTIS) and Digital Infuzion (DIFZ) under a contract with B.L. Seamon (NO1-AI-75323). Support for Phase I of this project was continued by contracting with these same firms through the National Cancer Institute’s Technical and Professional Services (NCI-TPS) mechanism -- (Contract # NO2-CO-24005 entitled “Analysis and Reengineering of DAIDS Business Process and the Architectural Development of a DAIDS Enterprise System”). The NCI-TPS expired in December 2002, resulting in DAIDS’ Task Order with CTIS expiring on March 31, 2003.  In order to continue this project, another task order for Phase II, for the design, development, deployment and operations of the DAIDS-ES, was competitively solicited using the NITAAC/CIO-SP2I mechanism with the award being made for a period of five months from April 1, 2003 through August 31, 2003 to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), subcontracting with Capital Technology Information Services.  All work is being performed under the CTIS subcontract with no major contributions by SAIC as prime.  Upon completion of this NITAAC Task Order, DAIDS will be awarding the contract for the completion of the DAIDS-ES to CTIS, thereby establishing a direct contractual relationship with the firm performing this project and provide cost savings to the Government.  

CTIS has responded to DAIDS’ need for automated, accurate and expedited safety reporting that is mission critical to insure DAIDS adherence with applicable regulatory requirements and guidelines through the development of this safety reporting system for DAIDS’ large portfolio of clinical trials, as discussed above by completing Phase I and now initiating the start-up of Phase II.  Due to the progress that CTIS has made in this endeavor, the CTIS team possesses unique capabilities and demonstrated their understanding of DAIDS and its Networks. It is critical that this existing relationships, architectural knowledge and institutional knowledge base be maintained to ensure the success of the DAIDS-ES/DAERS. 

The CTIS team has completed significant work on the DAERS.  Beta testing for the DAERS is planned to begin early April, 2003.  The Safety Reporting System must be fully operational in 2004.  It is critical that this work remain uninterrupted and on schedule. Any delay could compromise the ability of DAIDS to conduct their research trials and meet commensurate mandatory safety reporting requirements.  The CTIS team has a critical understanding of the DAIDS business and clinical research environment and has provided technical leadership in its work performed on Phases I and II of the DAIDS-ES development. It is also the intent of the DAIDS to use CTIS’s proprietary Commercial-Off-the-Shelf Software (COTS) TrialBridge™, which will be a critical component framework and tool for the successful design, development, deployment and operations of the DAIDS-ES system. CTIS shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment and processes for the DAIDS-ES.  With an incredibly large and complex clinical trials portfolio of over 300 sites and 30 countries, the DAIDS must be able to continue the development of the DAIDS-ES with CTIS and DIFZ in order to organize and proactively manage and maintain the critical information systems infrastructure for the DAIDS clinical trials and business management. The statutory authority justifying this other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), unique capabilities, e.g., supplies or services.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement if  they are able to perform the requirement with the required level of continuity.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) for highly specialized and complex system engineering services in support of two unique NASA/GSFC missions, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) missions.  The unique natures of the two missions imposes unusual demands upon the system engineering services contractor.  The LISA mission is the first space-based mission ever to attempt to measure gravitational waves from space, and it involves three identical spacecraft with uniquely precise measurements of distance between the spacecraft.  As a result, this mission involves highly complex interfaces and interdependencies that require a strong, centralized system engineering approach with a comparable scientific component.  Systems engineers who support the LISA mission must have expertise with highly complex, tightly coupled integrated systems and scientific knowledge of advanced physics as well as the complex science associated with space-based interferometry.  The LDCM mission is a component of the Landsat Program and will provide continuing Landsat data that is sufficiently consistent with previous Landsat data to allow the detection and quantitative characterization of changes in or on the land surface of the globe.	Unlike previous Landsat missions, the Government will purchase only the data products and not the system.  This means that the scientific data will be purchased from a private-sector system that also produces commercial data.  System engineers who support the LDCM mission must have comprehensive knowledge of the commercial remote sensing industry, including such things as market potential, technology trends, and capitalization requirements. NASA/GSFC intends to issue this RFP to Mitretek, Inc., located in Falls Church, Virginia, on a sole source basis.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. Mitretek is the only known contractor that has extensive experience with developing and maintaining a substantial workforce with the required combination of scientific and engineering skills.  Mitretek also has experience with collecting data and developing computer models for the remote sensing industry. The company's status as a nonprofit organization chartered to work exclusively in the public interest allows it access to data not available to for-profit companies, who may be in competition with system development contractors.  It also allows the company the ability to operate objectively, independent, and free from organizational conflict of interest. Only Mitretek has the unique combination of system engineering capability, advanced scientific expertise, specialized business knowledge, and organizational objectivity required to meet the unique support needs of the LISA and LDCM missions. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Interested firms have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities.  Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. All qualified responsible sources may submit a qualifications/capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue an out of scope modification to contract DCA200-02-D-5001 with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), 10260 Campus Point Drive, Building C, San Diego, CA  92121, to procure hardware for the Global Information Grid - Bandwith Expansion (GIG-BE) program.  SAIC is currently under contract to perform equipment evaluations, testing, and analysis leading to Government selection of an integrated set of equipment to meet the GIG-BE functional requirements.  The GIG-BE program office has determined that SAIC must perform the follow on acquisition of these equipment sets for the following reasons:   The GIG-BE program requires SAIC to perform a full and open competition for the evaluation of both integrated and component based equipment solutions.  This will allow the program to take advantage of competitive pricing in vendor responses to enable a best value solution to be selected.  SAIC is assisting in such a determination based upon information obtained during their initial tasking. If the government is to take advantage of the firm pricing provided to SAIC during the evaluation phase, SAIC must establish sub-contracts with the selected vendors. The GIG-BE program requires all components selected for acquisition to be fully integrated (including components from multiple vendor bids), demonstrated and tested prior to acquisition.  The components will be selected based on best value, lowest technical risk, greatest satisfaction of GIG-BE functional requirements, and interoperability between GIG-BE components as well as with legacy DISN components.  The GIG-BE program requires an integrator to be responsible for interoperability and correct functionality of all components that are integrated into a solution to satisfy the GIG-BE requirements.  SAIC is responsible for the initial integration, test, and will recommend a best value solution to the government.  The testing performed by SAIC will be observed by JITC and is an essential component of the overall GIG-BE test strategy.  Any equipment problems identified during this testing must be fixed prior to equipment installation/implementation.  In order to ensure the final integrated equipment suites delivered to the government accurately reflect those tested by SAIC and include fixes to any problems identified during testing, it is essential that SAIC be made responsible for negotiating problem resolution with multiple vendors, ordering, integrating, and re-testing (as required) all equipment into a solution that meets the government's requirements.  In addition, it is essential that continuity be maintained between component/suite testing/integration and equipment fielding, so that any systemic or recurring configuration issues can be effectively resolved.  The GIG-BE program, in order to provide timely, crucial telecommunications support to the warfighter and other critical non-DOD customers, must maintain an extremely aggressive schedule.  SAIC, as the single integrator responsible for the initial integration and testing, will be in the unique position to provide an already proven, integrated solution - saving critical time on the schedule by eliminating the need for additional problem resolution, providing an established, responsive ordering process, and by shortening the program's follow-on testing activities by supplying initial testing data and results.  No other course of action provides the PMO these efficiencies.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

TOPIC:  Next Generation Tactical Wheeled Vehicles OBJECTIVE:  The Army is interested in joint development of hybrid advanced technology tactical wheeled vehicles with a 3 to 20 ton payload.  The vehicle demonstration platform(s) shall include technologies that will enable the Army to meet the deployment a nd sustainment goals of the FCS and FTTS (MSV and UV variants) programs.  Core objectives will be a 30% reduction in fuel consumption; combat vehicle mobility; internal C130 & external CH-47 air transportation without preparation; intelligent load handling  system (load cargo & containers directly onto C-130 off load partial loads from flat racks); reduced logistics footprint; pit stop maintenance concept; improved vehicle capability; crew ballistic and mine protection capability; and a 1-to-1 ratio of vehic le weight to cargo capacity.  The sharing of data or current Models will be required for the Modeling and Simulation effort that will be utilized throughout the execution of this project. DESCRIPTION:  This project will result in the development and demonstration of one or more tactical wheeled vehicles and models that can be used by the Army to evaluate how new technologies will reduce the overall logistics footprint.  The demonstration pl atform(s) and the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) outputs of this program will be utilized by the Army to determine their impact on the Army’s transformation goals. The Government would like to make multiple awards (as many as affordable) against this topic.  Initial performance will focus on M&S to maximize the number of awards and their relevance to related Army efforts. First M&S review would be held within 30-60 days of award.  Each award made against this topic will include an option for hardware demonstr ation(s) to be exercisable by Dec 03 with initial delivery/demonstration within six months of exercise.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has a requirement to modify, test, maintain, and document the Acquisition Planning and Execution (APEX) system.  The Acquisition Planning and Execution (APEX) system is a web-based system that allows users to electronically develop, save, route for review and approval, and/or print a complete task order requirements package using either Netscape or Internet Explorer browsers.  In addition, APEX guides customers through the process of scoring contractors' proposals in a Fair Opportunity acquisition scenario.  The tool will enable customers to enter a single application (a web browser) and access the form templates they need to develop a requirements package that includes the Statement of Work, the Independent Government Cost Estimate, the funding document, contracting checklist, and other documents, as applicable.  Only Federal Supply Schedule holders will be considered for award.  Specifically, contractors holding GSA schedules under Schedule 70, SIN numbers 132-51 and 132-32.  The period of performance will be one base year and two additional option years.  The Request For Quotation (RFQ) and Statement of Work (SOW) documents can be obtained by e-mail request to bakers@ncr.disa.mil.  Hard copies will not be provided.

SECTION C:  White Paper Preparation Instructions

1.  General Instructions:  

a.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision of FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition. Offerors should consider proposal instructions contained in the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry, which can be accessed on line at www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract. This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the PRDA/BAA proposal process. White Papers must be valid for 60 days and must reference the above announcement number.  Offerors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their White Papers.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the government.  The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

2.  White Papers:  		

a.  Page Limitation: 5 pages per advanced demonstrator (total of 15 pages), 10 pitch or larger, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  It does not apply to the offeror’s proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW), which is limited to 6 pages (2 pages per demonstrator). The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. 

	b.  The White Papers shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the technical approach.  As a separate Volume, which will be in addition to the White Paper page limitation, provide additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort.  This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.


QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:  The following answers are provided in rsponse to questions received:

QUESTION:
	a.   Who will be providing (Government or Contractor) the standard delivery hardware as depicted in the statement? (Demonstrator #1, Page 2, Paragraph e and Demonstrator #2, Page 2, Paragraph e).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #1: The contractor shall provide standard delivery hardware.  The intent is to provide the hardware from the demonstrator outlets to four patients.  The hardware should include standard flow control equipment.  For this demonstration project, it is suggested that the hardware package include 4 each nasal cannula, 2 each non-rebreather face masks, and 1 each bag valve mask.  The contractor may suggest other quantities of these patient oxygen delivery items. 

Demonstrator #2: The contractor shall provide distribution hardware from the 2 each paratrooper supply outlets on the demonstrator to the 8 ea. remote paratrooper outlets.  The contractor is not required to provide delivery hardware for the medical outlets.   

QUESTION:
	b.  Does the hardware described in question a above count towards the total weight of the system? (Demonstrator #1, Page 2, Paragraph d). 

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #1: Yes.

QUESTION:
	c.  What are the specific airdrop parameters that must be met? Specifically, what is the terminal velocity of a 75 lb. mass being airdropped?  (Demonstrator #1, Page 2, Paragraph i).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #1: The intent is to be able to airdrop the unit, as an individual unit or as part of a standard pallet, from an aircraft cargo ramp at normal airdrop altitudes.  The unit must have full operational capability after landing.  The parachute will be supplied by the Government and secured on the unit by the Government prior to the airdrop mission.  The contractor must ensure the parachute can be properly attached and quickly detached.  Further, the parachute would not count toward the total weight of the unit. 

QUESTION:
	d.  What is the length of the oxygen hoses required for the manifold?  (Demonstrator #2, Page 2, Paragraph e).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The length of the hose that connects the demonstrator paratrooper supply outlet to 4 each paratrooper quick disconnects is estimated at 20 feet.  Two hoses are required. 


QUESTION:
	e.  What is the duration requirement of oxygen flow at 11 lpm for this system?  (Demonstrator #2, Page 3, Paragraph f).

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The demonstrator does not have a duration requirement at 11 LPM.  

QUESTION:
f.  Is the Contractor Statement Of Work (CSOW) required for Step 1 or Step 2 of the solicitation process? Or both?

ANSWER:
Both.  

QUESTION:
g.  Is ballistic protection required on the top and bottom in addition to all four sides on all the systems? 

ANSWER:
Ballistic protection is required on all sides and top and bottom of all systems.  Side protection would be the most critical.  The Government is aware the contractor will require some openings in the ballistic protection hardware to ensure proper functioning of the unit and access to the connections and controls/displays.  Therefore, it is suggested that the contractor design openings which do not expose the most vulnerable internal components to ballistic rounds.  The intent is that the unit should not injure anyone or damage equipment nearby after being struck by 7.62 mm rounds.  It is acceptable for the unit to be non-functional after being hit by ballistic rounds.  

QUESTION:
	h.  What is the number of total outlets for Demonstrator #2?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2 Outlets (i.e. outlets on the unit):
a. 2 ea. paratrooper supply outlets with each capable of delivering 100 ambient LPM at sea level.
b. 1 ea. standard paratrooper outlet, to be used if one of the remote paratrooper outlets is damaged.
c. 4 ea. standard medical outlets.

Demonstrator #2 Remote Outlets:
8 ea. standard paratrooper outlets.

QUESTION:
	i.  Will the paratrooper and medical outlets be used simultaneously?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The paratrooper and medical outlets will not be used simultaneously.

QUESTION:
	j, What is the maximum system flow for Demonstrator #2?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2: The maximum flow would be 200 ambient liters/minute at sea level.

QUESTION:
Demonstrator #2:  The Combat Oxygen System solicitation refers to "Liquid oxygen storage volume: 25 Liters" (see Advanced Demonstrator #2, Paratrooper Oxygen System). Does this mean that the proposed system should use LOX (liquid oxygen), or was this terminology used simply as a measurement of volume (capacity)?

ANSWER:
Demonstrator #2:  The proposed system should use liquid oxygen and the storage volume should be 25 liters.

<DESC>NRCS-CO-3-14 is modified to include the services covered by NRCS-CO-3-13, which has been cancelled.  The only difference is that there will one one solicitation for soil mapping services covering the whole state of COlorado instead of two covering the eastern and western portions of the state.  Everything else remains the same.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is planning a Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study of soil mapping services in the NRCS offices in Colorado.

Major components of this work include:  researching existing information pertaining to the survey area (i.e. existing soil surveys, topographic and geologic maps, and aerial photographs); conducting soil mapping activities, collecting and analyzing field data, and  identifying soil types and series that will meet or exceed National Cooperative Soil Survey standards; preparing samples of the soil profile and descriptions from the surface to a depth of 60 inches; classifying samples by soil taxonomy and assigning a series name;  developing map units and maintaining official map unit legend; compiling official field notes, soil profile sheets, field transect sheets, and mapping field sheets by map unit; and entering all documentation into the National Soils Information System (NASIS).  This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Shuttle Program (SSP) seeks information (listed in Part B below) from organizations that may be interested in collaborating with NASA to provide Astronaut Crew Clothing (as described in Part A below) for a minimum of 2 years on approximately 12 Space Shuttle flights for up to 7 crewmembers per flight. This collaboration would be on a non-exclusive basis, at no additional cost to the Government, with advertising restrictions (as described in Part C below).  NASA may in the future issue a “Request for Entrepreneurial Offer” (REO) that could lead to one or more Space Act Agreements. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Part A:  SSP Astronaut Crew Clothing Requirements Introduction The SSP provides clothing and accessories for the male and female astronaut crewmembers to wear for the duration of a Space Shuttle mission (up to 15 days in micro-gravity).  Crewmembers range in size from a 5th percentile Asian female to a 100th percentile Caucasian male.  Typical clothing for a Space Shuttle mission is listed below.  Flight specific shirts are also provided to the crew 1 year prior to launch for use in training and public appearances.  Most crew clothing can be reused on future flights except the flight-specific flight and training shirts. Material Properties All clothing materials require review and approval by NASA Materials and Processes prior to flight.  Documents JSC28484 appendix D and JSC27301D refer to material certifications. Clothing containing a minimum of 95 percent cotton is recommended based upon the preference for material that would char rather than melt (such as polyesters) if exposed to high temperatures or flash fires.	Sweaters must be at least 70 percent cotton.  Exceptions to the 95 percent cotton requirement include undergarments worn under other clothing items and nylon athletic shorts provided for exercise only and not as a main clothing item.  Exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis through the NASA materials review and approval process.  Items that are lint producing are washed and tumbled multiple times, followed by shaving, if necessary, to decrease the amount of lint particles.  The vendors will be required to provide similar linting prevention methods prior to delivery as required for their particular items. Products that are antilinting, antistatic and antiodor are encouraged.  Other innovations will be considered. Typical Flight Preparation Clothing and accessories will be first selected by the crew, and are to be delivered by the vendor for fitting and crew review, with sufficient time for resizing or modification by the vendor, as necessary, prior to final delivery.  The final items must be delivered to NASA Johnson Space Center 6 weeks prior to launch.  The vendor must provide a materials listing to NASA in order to close all certification issues prior to final delivery.  To reduce lint, clothing/personal items are currently washed with standard off-the-shelf detergent per manufacturer's instructions and tumbled dry for 2 hours in 1-hour increments.  Clothing items are shaved as necessary to remove lint particles. Representative List of Current Crew Clothing.  (Numbers specified below are on a per crewmember basis.	Total number needed will be multiplied by up to 7 crewmembers per mission and up to 6 missions per year). 1.  Sleep/Exercise Shirt Sleep/exercise shirts are short sleeved, pocketless, knit, athletic shirts.  Recommended usage rate is two to five per mission. 2.  IVA Flight and Training Shirts The flight and training shirts are either long sleeve or short sleeve shirts in colors and styles selected by the crewmember.  All crew shirts may be monogrammed at crew request.  Recommended usage rate is one shirt per day for flight and two shirts for training activities. 3.  Sweater/Jacket Each crewmember selects one jacket or one sweater per mission. 4.  Athletic Shorts Athletic shorts can be worn with or without bike shorts.  Recommended usage rate is three to five pair per mission. 5.  Shorts Crew shorts will have adjustable waistbands and contain at least three pockets that can be opened and securely closed with one hand on demand.  The pockets will contain small loose items in a 0-g environment.  Shorts have a Velcro pattern on the front legs to support addition of the removable pocket.  The legs must be long enough to cover approximately two-thirds of a crewmember’s inseam above the knee to avoid exposure when viewed by multiple camera angles on-orbit.  Recommended usage rate is three to five per mission. 6.  Trousers Trousers will have an adjustable waistband, two side pockets, two hip pockets, a lower leg pouch, and Velcro pattern on the legs to support a removable pocket.  Recommended usage rate is three to five per mission. 7.  Undergarments (male and female) Undergarments have a recommended usage rate of one per day. 8.  Socks The crew is allowed to choose from a variety of crew and tube socks made of cotton and/or polyester.  Recommended usage rate of crew/tube socks is one pair per day.  Slipper socks are a wool blend with a leather sole.  Recommended usage rate of slipper socks is one per flight. 9.	Long Underwear Long Underwear is worn under the pressure suits during launch and landing.  Depending on the time of launch and inclination of the mission, either midweight, lightweight or heavyweight top and bottom long underwear are flown.  Crewmembers may also fly additional sets for sleeping.  Recommended usage rate is two to three per flight. 10.  Gloves Glove options include deerskin gloves or summer weight pilot’s gloves for both men and women.	Recommended usage rate is one per mission. 11.  Shoes Shoes include athletic running shoes without cleats and cycling shoes with “look-style” cleats.  Cycling shoes with cleats are used to interface with the Flight ergometer. Recommended usage rate for both types of shoes is one pair per mission. 12.  Handkerchief Handkerchiefs are white and made of cotton.  Recommended usage rate is three to five per mission.

Points of Contact (business & technical) PART C:	NASA Regulations for Advertising Requests NASA generally has no objection to the reproduction, distribution, or use of NASA imagery, including NASA photographs, subject to the following conditions: 1.	NASA imagery may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, service, or activity, or used in any manner that might mislead. 2.  NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the imagery. 3.  It is unlawful to falsely claim copyright or other rights in NASA imagery. 4.  NASA shall in no way be liable for any costs, expenses, claims, or demands arising out of the use of NASA imagery by a recipient or a recipient's distributees. 5.  NASA does not indemnify nor hold harmless users of NASA imagery, nor release such users from copyright infringement, nor grant exclusive use rights with respect to NASA imagery. 6.  NASA imagery is not protected by copyright unless noted.  If copyrighted, permission should be obtained from the copyright owner prior to use.  If not copyrighted, NASA imagery may be reproduced and distributed without further permission from NASA. 7.  If a recognizable person (e.g., an astronaut or other individual) appears in NASA imagery, use for commercial purposes may infringe that individual's personal right of privacy or publicity.  If that individual is not currently employed by the U.S. Government, permission should be obtained from that individual if the proposed use of the NASA material could be viewed as a commercial exploitation of that person.  Government ethics laws prevent current Federal employees from granting such permission.  However, if the intended use of NASA material is primarily for communicative purposes, i.e., books, newspapers, and magazines reporting facts of historical significance (constitutionally protected media uses), then such uses will generally be considered not to infringe such personal rights. 8.  Federal law precludes the use the of the words "National Aeronautics and Space Administration" or the letters "NASA", or any combination, variation, or colorable imitation of those words or letters either alone or in combination with other words or letters, (1) as a firm or business name in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such firm or business has some connection with, endorsement of, or authorization from, NASA which does not, in fact, exist; or (2) in connection with any product or service being offered or made available to the public in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such product or service has the authorization, support, sponsorship, or endorsement of, or the development, use, or manufacture by or on behalf of NASA which does not, in fact, exist. 9.  Use of NASA graphic identifiers, particularly, the NASA insignia, sometimes referred to as the NASA "meatball": a.  The manufacture and commercial sale of the NASA insignia as a separate and distinct device in the form of an emblem, patch, insignia, badge, decal, vinylcal, cloth, metal, or other material which would preclude NASA's control over its use or application is prohibited. b.  No approval for use of the NASA insignia will be authorized when its use can be construed as an endorsement by NASA of a product or service. c.  Items bearing the NASA insignia such as souvenirs, novelties, toys, models, clothing, and similar items (including items for sale through the NASA employees' nonappropriated fund activities) may be manufactured and sold only after the NASA insignia application has been submitted to, and approved by, the Associate Administrator for Public Affairs, or designee, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.  20546. d.  Use of the NASA insignia for any other purpose than as prescribed herein is prohibited, except that the Associate Administrator for Public Affairs may authorize on a case-by-case basis the use of the NASA insignia for other purposes when the Associate Administrator for Public Affairs deems such use to be appropriate.

The family of hand held signals (HHS) is use for both daytime and nighttime signaling and nighttime signaling in the case of the M127A1. They are used all military services. The star clusters consist of five-star illuminant assemblies and a rocket motor pr opulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge. As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing. Stabilizing fins  on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the intiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant which fills the propulsion assembly. The illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between.  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal. The parachute signals consist of a parachute-suspended illuminant assembly and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube. The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge. As shipped, the f iring pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing. Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, exte nds into the center of the solid propellant, which fills the propulsion assembly. The parachute/illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between them.  The parachute with suspension chor ds is packed on top of the illuminant, and the tube end is sealed with a cork disk (rocket barrel seal). A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal. The propelling charge for both cluster and parachute type signals is a black powder composition with about 9% calcium carbonate.  Black powder is used for the initiating and expelling charge for both cluster and parachute signals. The primer is percussion no. 68 and is used in both cluster and parachute signals.

<DESC>NA The Northern Regional Contracting Center (NRCC), Installation Division – Fort Lee Branch located at Fort Lee (Prince George County), Virginia is conducting a market survey.  The survey is to identify firms that possess the capabilities, knowledge and resou rces to meet the unique and demanding requirements of the Regional Tidewater Directorates of Public Works (DPW) or Directorates of Engineering and Logistics (DEL) supported by the NRCC – Fort Lee Branch.   The DPW/DEL’s consist of various military installa tions that include Fort Eustis, Fort Lee, Fort Monroe, Fort Pickett and Fort Story.  The requirement will be for Architect - Engineer (A-E) Services only and is not intended to function as a design-build contract.  The following are examples of the types o f services that have been previously completed and are anticipated under the proposed action:  1. Designs and/or Feasibility Studies of administrative, educational, industrial and warehouse facilities as well as barracks, army family housing and other existing facilities, 2. Various Designs/Studies utilizing disciplines such as Architectural, Mechan ical, Structural, Civil, Land Surveying, Geotechnical (Soils Engineer), Environmental, and Electrical Engineers, as well as Estimating, Plumbing, Communication, Fire Protection and Energy Management Controls, 3. Design new and/or renovate existing faciliti es to accommodate various functions and use groups, 4. Landscape design, 5. Master Planning documentation, 6. Installation design guides, 7. Marketing Brochures, 8. 1391 Preparation, 9. Design Charrette’s and concept designs, 10. Construction Contract Admi nistration (Quality Assurance (QA) Inspectors), 11. Design renderings and presentations, 12. Virtual/Web based presentations, 13. Building condition Reports, 14. Rehabilitation of historic buildings and structures, 15. AutoCAD services, and 16. Environment al Surveys, Reports and Studies.   The A-E firm shall maintain a staff of licensed and registered Architects and Engineers.  The firm shall have the financial capabilities to successfully execute priorities; and handle workload surges of various scope and complexity for multiple Task Orders  throughout the entire Tidewater Region.  The government requests interested firms identify their interests and capabilities to meet the above requirements by submitting their Standard Forms (SF) 254 & 255.  The documents shall be submitted in hard copy fo rmat to the Northern Regional Contract Center (NRCC), Installation Division – Fort Lee, ATTN: George Herndon, 1830 Quartermaster Road, Fort Lee, VA 23801-1606. Telephone (804) 734-4985 and email: herndong@lee.army.mil no later than (NLT) 2:00 P.M. local ti me, 1 May 03.  In addition the firms shall answer the following questions:   Unique capabilities of the A-E: Volume of Work:   Due to the funding cycle of the Federal Government, the regional tidewater DPW/DEL’s  typically have the majority of their Operation & Maintenance Appropriation (OMA) designs (and construction) positioned and awarded during the 4th  quarter (Jul-Sep) of th e fiscal year.  For example, of the over $1M average of design services prepared each fiscal year through the tidewater regional contract, over 70% of the Task Orders are awarded during the 4th quarter,  thereby making the start and completion dates for su ch projects running concurrently with each other.  1.  Question: How would your firm intend to handle a workload surge of such magnitude (i.e. numerous projects at different Installations) with start and completion dates all within the same time period? 2.  Question: How does your firm intend to allocate/develop/obtain the resources required to execute approximately  $1M of design work for multiple Installations at the same time? Responsiveness:   Often, the Tidewater Regional DPW/DEL’s  require immediate assistance that demands instant  responsiveness by the A-E (i.e., same or next day) to mission critical directives that might include  a scope development meeting, investigation of a facility, concept design and cost estimate or some other action requiring A-E services.   3.  Question: How would your firm respond to such an urgent request requiring immediate attention while maintaining ongoing project schedules? Please describe in detail how the Project Managers, Architects and Engineers for on-going projects will be distri buted to meet such requests.    The Tidewater Regional A-E contract is a 3-year contract (1 Base Period + 2 Option Periods).  Often, designs completed  by the A-E are under construction while the A-E contract is ongoing, other times after the completion of the contract period.   4.  Question: How does your firm view A-E liability during construction? Does your firm view it as a continuation of the design process or as a separate functional element of the Construction contract?   5.  Question: How would your firm respond to differing site conditions and/or design deficiencies discovered during construction involving a design completed under the subject contract?   6.  Question: What would be the process for corrective action? 7.  Question: What are the processes in place for reviewing submittals during construction? Experience: The Tidewater Regional DEL’s typically execute (for construction) the designs completed under A-E contracts through various means.  8.  Question: What is the your firms' experience with designing projects to be executed through:       a. Job Order Contracting (JOC)?       b. Corps of Engineers?       c. Installation Contracting Offices?

Personnel will also provide technical support to AFRL/IFE to assist in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing and evaluation of DoDIIS Migration Systems and provide support to US Intelligence Community Activities.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months   A technical library relating to this Acquisition is being prepared.  The Read Library contains data that is export controlled; therefore, will only be distributed to those who submit an approved DD Form 2345 and a letter from the data custodian (cited on the DD Form 2345) that the recipient can receive the data.  It will be distributed via CD to offerors who have submitted the appropriate documentation.  Any questions relating to the technical library should be communicated to Mr. Dennis O. Jones, 315-330-4489, Dennis.Jones@rl.af.mil or Mr. Melvin G. Manor, Jr., 315-330-3304, Melvin.Manor@rl.af.mil.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572.  Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  Top Secret SCI Facilities of at least 2000 square feet (with JWICS  connectivity and Safeguarding) and 110 Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance.  Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside.  Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.  Responses to this announcement should indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000).  As discussed at FAR 19.502-2(b)(1) and (2), in making R&D small business set-asides, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and also a reasonable expectation of obtaining the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules. The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside. Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award.  This information will assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.  Provide information on at least three (3) contracts for similar work within the past five (5) years.  Include complete references, contract titles, dollar values, points of contact and telephone numbers.  The Government will evaluate relevant experience information based on (1) information provided by the Offeror, (2) information obtained from the references provided by the respondent, and/or (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  In addition to the statement of capabilities, please provide answers to the following questions:  (1)  Does your company intend to submit a proposal in response to the upcoming solicitation as a prime contractor?  (2)  How many people does your company employ?  (3)  Will you need to hire additional personnel to perform this effort?  (4)  Is your company's cost accounting system approved by DCAA or DCMC?  If not, how would your company financially administer a cost-reimbursement type contract? (5)  Are there any other factors concerning your company's ability to perform the upcoming effort that the Air Force should consider?  Respondents are requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Large businesses are also encouraged to submit e-mails of intent should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.  All qualification packages must be addressed to the attention of Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist, AFRL/IFB, at the address referenced at the beginning of this notice, and must be received by 4:00 P.M., EST, on 25 Apr 03.  Responses must reference the solicitation number, and contain the respondent's Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, email address, mailing address and FAX number.  While the Small Business Specialist, Janis Norelli, is the focal point for receipt of the statements of capabilities, technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, Dennis O. Jones at 315-330-4489, e-mail:  jonesd@rl.af.mil. Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist at 315-330-4731, e-mail martinellim@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>This synopsis is published pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.205(c), and is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  NOTE:  There is no additional information available for release at this time.  Verbal request for information will not be provided.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, SSES is seeking information regarding the potential use of commercially available, non-developmental and affordable gas turbine engine exhaust collector assemblies suitable, with minimal modifications, for the TF40B gas turbine engine exhaust collector assembly application on the U. S. Navy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Vehicle.  In this application, the TF40B gas turbine engine exhaust gas flow discharges from the engine exhaust diffuser into the exhaust collector assembly. The exhaust collector a ssembly turns the exhaust flow from the horizontal to the vertical direction.  The exhaust flow discharges thereafter to the vehicle exhaust stack.  A gap exists between the top of the exhaust collector and the vehicle exhaust stack thereby forming an exhaust eductor arrangement for engine compartment cooling purposes.  The gas turbine engine exhaust diffuser extends into the exhaust collector.  The exhaust collector assembly is insulated.  The insulated exhaust collector assembly must fit in the existing space constraints of the LCAC which are defined as follows for the purposes herein: approximately 25 in. L x 43 in. W x 54 in. H.  The length dimension represents the depth of the insulated exhaust collector (which is situated behind the engine and envelopes the rear portion of the engine exhaust diffuser.) The exhaust collector assembly must be capable of accommodating the ex haust flow conditions defined as follows for the purposes herein:  29.5 lbs/sec at an exhaust temperature of 1275 F and a maximum pressure drop of 3 inches of water.  (The exhaust collector handles the engine exhaust flow only.  Engine compartment cooling flow is drawn by the engine exhaust flowing through the eductor arrangement.)  The fuels utilized for this application are NATO F-76 and JP-5.  The operating environment is that of a naval surface combatant in a salt laden atmosphere.  This is not a solicitation/RFP and there are no known future requirements pending at this time.  Any information (physical and performance characteristics, illustrations/drawings depicting the exhaust collector assembly, commercial applications, operating experience, development/production status, space and weight requirements, discussion on suitability for use on naval surface combatant ships,  and availability, etc.) submitted relative to this request for information should be forwarded to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, SSES, 5001 S. Broad St., Code 3352, Attn: Karen Van Giesen, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1403 within 30 days of this announcement date.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract N01-HD-2-3159 with the E. P. Bradley Hospital, Providence, RI for the development and implementation of a battery of tests and assessment techniques to describe the neurodevelopment outcome of children at risk for abnormal outcome as a result of exposure to
drugs in-utero. The contract was initiated in 1992 for the purpose of developing a battery of tests and assessments to be administered to children enrolled in a multicenter longitudinal observational study of maternal lifestyles during pregnancy on acute neonatal events and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.  The clinical portion of the study was initiated in 1991 at four Neonatal Research Network sites, Detroit, Miami, Memphis and Providence. Under the current contract with E.P. Bradley Hospital, a cohort of 1100 mother-infant dyads exposed to drugs and their controls (enrolled at the network sites) were followed and assessed from the age of one month through age seven, utilizing the battery of tests and assessments developed by the contractor.  Under the proposed continuation of the study, the cohort will continue from age seven through age eleven with further development and refinement, by Bradley Hospital, of the testing procedures to be used.  The contractor has developed a plan for analysis of the data collected at the four centers and is currently implementing these analyses.  In order to perform the continued work a new contractor would need access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subjected to a comparable neurodevelopmental assessment battery from infant to age 7.  Based on the foregoing information, the NICHD plans to negotiate with the E. P. Bradley Hospital for the continuation of this contract using other than full and open competition in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for completion of this project. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources capable of meeting the Government's requirements as described.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of publication of this synopsis to Paul J. Duska, NIH, NICHD, CMB, Executive Building, Room 7A07, 6100 Executive Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 and should include details specifying how this work would be performed.  See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>69 -- On-Site Contractor Support for Foreign Military Constructive Simulation Centers in Uzbekistan and Ukraine
<SOLNBR>None
<RESPDATE>041503
<ARCHDATE>04302003
<CONTACT>Melissa Santarsiero, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-208-4199, Fax 407-380-4164, Email melissa_santarsiero@stricom.army.mil
<DESC>The PEO-STRI Office of Defense Exports and Security Cooperation is issuing a Request for Information to contractors interested in providing on-site technical support to constructive simulation centers being established in Uzbekistan and Ukraine under the auspices of the U.S. Army’s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Due to the annual incremental nature of U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF), this contract action will involve an initial twelve month period of performance in each country, with options for a second and third twelve month period.  It is undetermined at this time as to whether this will be a full and open competition.

Any interested contractor is requested to prepare a paper not exceeding 3 pages addressing their capabilities to perform as an on-site technical support contractor for the operation of constructive simulations in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and Kiev, Ukraine.  The reply should also contain an estimate of manpower and Rough Order of Magnitude cost to perform each effort. A pre-solicitation conference is also planned during the week of 5 May to discuss and answer any questions regarding this opportunity.

In support of the Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Uzbekistan Armed Forces, PEO-STRI under the Foreign Military Sales program is establishing a Janus based Constructive Simulation Center in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. This center is anticipated to initially conduct Brigade or below level exercises in support of Defense Academy instruction during the course of a year.  It is initially anticipated that there may be small level, short in duration exercises in support of Defense Academy courses every 2-3 weeks and 2-3 separate Brigade or below level exercises in support of the MOD over the year period.  Contractor support is required throughout the year to provide on-the-job training in Janus system administration and database management, as well as support to the conduct of scheduled training exercises. It is anticipated that a separate “SIMMaster” will already be in place at the simulation center to perform the function of overall coordination and oversight of these exercises. In addition, due to the multi-faceted and complex nature of this overall Uzbekistan Foreign Military Sales program, the SIMMaster will also act as lead Program Integrator on-site to direct the simulation and training capabilities being established and implementation of the overaching M&S Master Plan for Uzbekistan.

Similarly, in support of the Ministry of Defense and Ukrainian Armed Forces, PEO-STRI under the Foreign Military Sales program is establishing a JCATS based Constructive Simulation capability in Kiev, Ukraine. This capability will be installed at two facilities, directly adjacent to each other at the National Defense Academy (NDA) and the Multinational Staff Officers Course (MSOC). The center at the NDA is anticipated to initially conduct Brigade or below level exercises in support of Defense Academy instruction during the course of a year.  It is initially anticipated that there may be small level, short in duration exercises in support of Defense Academy courses every 2-3 weeks and 1-2 separate Brigade or below level exercises in support of the MOD over the year period.  The center at the MSOC will have a focus on “peace support operations” and the exercises, scenarios and simulation databases will be developed/modified to support that course of instruction.  The MSOC center will support initially small level, short duration exercises in support of ongoing MSOC course every 2-3 weeks.  It should be assumed that initially the two centers will not conduct any exercises simultaneously.  Contractor support is required throughout the year to provide on-the-job training in JCATS system administration and database management, as well as support to the conduct of scheduled training exercises.  It is anticipated that a separate “SIMMaster” will already be in place at the simulation center to perform the function of overall coordination and oversight of these exercises. In addition, due to the multi-faceted and complex nature of this overall Ukraine Foreign Military Sales program, the SIMMaster will also act as lead Program Integrator on-site to direct the simulation and training capabilities being established at both facilities and implementation of the overaching M&S Master Plan for Ukraine.  

The Government intends to select an on-site contractor for each location.  These efforts are separate and distinct and could be awarded to different contractors.  Therefore, interested contractors should address each country’s requirement separately in their responses.  Work is expected to commence in Uzbekistan in January 2004 and Ukraine in March 2004.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-3-28-2003-PostalAssets

<CONTACT>Trent Ensley, Purchasing Specialist, Phone 202-268-5787, Fax 202-268-2595, Email tensley@email.usps.gov
<DESC>Background:

The Postal Service has always prided itself in its ability to optimize the productivity of its physical assets that provide mail services.   This focus has enabled the Postal Service to maintain affordable postal rates while consistently providing high service standards for customers. The Postal Service is challenging itself as part of the Transformation Plan to find new ways to leverage its physical assets for generating income to help further offset the overhead and operational costs of these assets.   One path the organization is interested in pursuing is to identify those assets, with the exception of trucks and collection boxes, which may be offered to private sector enterprises for the placement of advertising messages.

The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to hear from those companies that have the interest and expertise to team with the Postal Service to as we leverage Postal assets.  The Postal Service wants to identify firms that have the ability to identify potential postal assets suitable for the placement of advertising, assess the potential of those assets in terms of revenue generation and develop and market those assets that advertisers would be willing to use for advertising messages.  The Postal Service expects that such firms would coordinate and manage the activities necessary for placement of advertisements on Postal assets.  This would include necessary coordination and approval of advertisements with Postal organizations as well providing turnkey services to facilitate the placement of advertisements from potential entities.  Such services would include, but not be limited to the identification of potential advertisers, insuring necessary rights are obtained prior to placement of an ad, executing terms and conditions with potential advertisers and proper accounting of payments and revenues.  The Postal Service is seeking to identify firms for this venture that have the capabilities described above and that will consider revenue sharing models that would not obligate the Postal Service to any upfront or out-of-pocket expenditures.  



Examples of Postal Assets:

On a small scale the Postal Service has made available and ventured to sell advertising space on some of its properties in the past.  Specifically, advertising space has been sold on postal envelopes (Priority Mail & Express Mail), USPS.com web site, retail lobby table tents, and other retail signage.   Other assets that have been considered include sales receipts, stamp packaging and backings, and publications.  These are examples and should not be considered to be a complete list of assets that could be leveraged as advertising media.  

In addition to being associated with a highly respected brand, we believe that a strong appeal to advertisers is the ability to reach large numbers of consumers and business people by advertising on USPS assets.  The Postal Service operates 38,000 post offices and is visited by approximately 7.5 million adults every day.  The USPS .Com web site attracts 7 million hits a month.  More than 1 billion stamp booklets are sold annually.  Additionally, 320 million Express and Priority Mail envelopes and packages are provided to customers for shipping.  

The Information We Are Requesting:

It is the intention of the Postal Service to competitively solicit for a partner to identify, develop and market those physical assets that will be of interest to advertisers for the placement of advertising.  The USPS reserves the right at a future date to structure this transaction under the USPS procurement regulations or as a strategic alliance.  However, before the Postal Service issues a competitive solicitation, it is seeking to better understand the capabilities of firms in the marketplace and gain information that will lead to requirements that will be of interest to the marketplace and offer the best chance to establish a partnership that will result in financial success for both parties.  With this in mind the Postal Service would like the following information from enterprises that may be interested in teaming with the Postal Service on the venture described.

a.	Please provide a description of your company and its experience in marketing media assets to advertisers for the placement of advertising.  Standard company literature is welcome
b.	Please provide insights as to how the Postal Service might structure the offer of its assets to have the broadest appeal to advertisers.
c.	Please identify what in your view would need to be a necessary condition of the relationship any partner company forms with the Postal Service to be successful in this venture.

Please direct your response to this request to Rod DeVar, Manager, Advertising and Promotion, 1735 N. Lynn St. Arlington, VA 22209-6111.   All responses should be received by April 18, 2003.  Thank you for your consideration of this request.

<DESC>CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tank Farm Contract, is soliciting interest and information from qualified firms having the capability of performing analytical services (laboratory management; inorganic, organic and radiochemical analyses; methods development and process troubleshooting) for the analysis of radioactive and/or hazardous waste samples.  The DOE has announced the pending transfer of the 222-S Laboratory to CH2M HILL, the primary user of the Laboratory’s analytical services.  In addition to supporting CH2M HILL, the Laboratory provides site-wide analytical services for the Hanford site.  CH2M HILL is interested in contracting with a nationally recognized laboratory organization to gain commercial efficiencies in operations. 

This will be a local business preference solicitation. To be considered local, interested parties must be operating in the local vicinity of the Hanford site for the duration of any resulting contract.  For interested parties not presently operating within the local vicinity, but plan to respond to the proposed solicitation, sufficient details showing such planning so as to be fully operational at the time of contract award (September 2003) shall be required to be submitted with their proposal.   

Further it is the intent of CH2M HILL to provide the maximum practical opportunity for small businesses to participate in contract performance.  Therefore, small businesses, small women-owned businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and small service-disabled businesses are encouraged to apply and/or participate in teaming agreements to participate in contract performance.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for determining size status is 541380.     

Interested parties are hereby requested to review and provide comments on the information provided herein.  Closing date for this RFI is May 14, 2003. An informational session on the existing analytical services will be conducted on April 24, 2003.  Tour schedules of the facility will be announced at the meeting. Participants will be advised where to meet for the tour.  The tour will be restricted to two individuals for each firm who will participate.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be released on or about June 18, 2003.  There will be a second tour conducted after the draft RFP has been issued for those parties who wish to attend.


CH2M HILL is requesting interest and information on 3 options for analytical services:
1.	Management and direction of the 222-S Analytical Laboratory on the Hanford site that is being transferred to CH2M HILL, as a member of the CH2M HILL team.
2.	Becoming an approved subcontractor to CH2M HILL in charge of the analytical services scope performing the analyses for CH2M HILL including absorbing the current equipment and staff (augmented as appropriate) into the subcontract organization to complete the necessary scope.
3.	Performing some or all of the analytical services scope at offsite operations 

The successful Contractor shall be required to accept the Labor Agreement in place with the Hanford Atomic Metal Trade Council (HAMTC-AFL-CIO) at the time of contract award. The terms of this Labor Agreement will be applicable to these employees until the Contractor executes a new labor contract with HAMTC.  The successful Contractor will be required to offer employment to transferring HAMTC represented personnel.  These bargaining unit employees will become employees of the Contractor as of the effective date of the Contract for Options 2 and 3.  Any grievances/arbitrations occurring after the start of this work shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  The number of personnel, craft specialties, wage rates, etc. will be made available in the draft RFP.

The successful Contractor will be expected to consider offering positions to the existing exempt and non-exempt staff.  The number of exempt and non-exempt personnel and their specialties will be made available in the draft RFP.

The existing equipment and instrumentation located in the 222-S Laboratory will be made available to the Contractor for Options 1 and 2, provided it is deemed suitable for release under Government and CH2M HILL procedures.  Equipment and instrumentation that can be made available and is deemed suitable for use by the Contractor will be made available for use at no additional cost to the Contractor. 

The successful Contractor shall be required to give priority to CH2M HILL’s and other Hanford site contractors’ analytical services requirements. The total annual volume of analytical services work is estimated to be $30M with currently around 25,000 analyses consisting of 20% organic analyses (PCB, VOA, SVOA), 30% radiochemistry and 50% inorganic analyses (primarily metals). Additional analytical service needs and equipment in support of the Office of River Protection Project may become a part of the final Request for Proposal. 

The successful Contractor must comply with the following codes, standards and other requirements as specified within task orders as well as applicable Federal, State and local laws, licensing and regulations:

<DESC>The INEEL has developed a novel technology for significantly reducing 2-cycle engine exhaust emissions.  This patented technology has the potential to make 2-cycle engines run cleaner by significantly reducing smog emissions while simultaneously reducing noise emissions. It also promises to be relatively inexpensive to implement.  The technology utilizes a modified vortex tube design, which causes unconsumed oil in the exhaust to condense and collect where it can be easily discarded.  The INEEL is soliciting a joint collaboration with manufacturers of small spark ignition 2 cycle engines to develop, test and evaluate a prototype version of this emissions separator for application on a small 2-cycle engine.  A successful development project will result in licensing opportunities for parties providing funding and in-kind support.

<CONTACT>Klaus D Sexton, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-2271, Fax (301) 286-6299, Email Klaus.D.Sexton.1@gsfc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information from potential sources regarding the availability, cost, capabilities and specifications of flight and ground components that could support Ka-Band data services within NASA's Space Network. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeks broad community comments and inputs concerning high data rate Ka-band flight communications systems, ground receivers, and data system components for use within NASA's Space Network (SN).  Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is currently performing infrastructures upgrades within the SN, and demonstrations (up to 600 Mbps) of high rate RF equipment utilizing NASA's new Ka-band capable TDRS H,I,J spacecraft.  As a next step to these upgrades, NASA intends to perform a major expansion to the SN through the procurement and implementation of high data rate (1 Gbps or higher) data demodulation, routing, processing, and storage technologies for use in the SN.  In addition to the bitstream services that are currently available, this expansion may include end-to-end standard network services from the spacecraft to the user including file transfers and time synchronization.  Procurement and implementation activities for the SN Ka-band data service upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of FY 06.  As part of this activity, NASA also intends to identify flight components that could be used on NASA science spacecraft for the transfer of data to and from ground stations via TDRS spacecraft. Many proposed Earth and Space science missions desire data services that will be difficult to implement using the current communications infrastructure. These projected needs include data-rates in excess of 1Gb/s, direct delivery of data products simultaneously to many users, the ability of the spacecraft to autonomously interact with other space-based or ground-based sensors, and the ability of investigators to directly log-on to their space-based instruments for command and control functions from their own control centers or laboratories. Due to increasing congestion in the S-, X-, and Ku-band frequency spectrums, and an ever-increasing demand for higher data rate transmissions by low earth orbiting (LEO) customer spacecraft, it has become necessary to explore the use of higher radio frequency spectrum for NASA space-to-ground communications requirements.  The available spectrum is a finite resource, and as the data throughput requirements from space to ground increase beyond the available X and Ku-band spectrum, it will become necessary for NASA LEO spacecraft to transition to the allocated Ka-Band spectrum for space to ground communications links via NASA's SN and Ground Network (GN). NASA/GSFC is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) for the purpose of openly soliciting information on available or emerging products to implement the end-to-end SN Ka-Band data service including: Flight communications systems and/or components across a range of data rates from tens of kbps to at least 1 Gbps, Ground receivers, equalizers, decoders and data storage and transmission components capable of supporting Ka-Band data rates up to at least 1 Gbps, Data network technologies and equipment for use in space and on the ground to provide higher level data routing and delivery services over the Ka-band link. Vendors having the capabilities or products necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  Interested firms are requested to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 12 pages , and any other appropriate documentation not to exceed 50 pages.	Responses may be sent via regular mail, electronic mail or fax to: Yen F. Wong, Yen.F.Wong@nasa.gov, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Code 567, Bldg 12, Rm E226A, Greenbelt, MD 20771 301-286-7446, Fax 301-286-1725  All information received will be combined and used for Government purposes.  Sources are urged to describe their approach and products in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information may be appropriate.  The information received in response to this RFI will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of Government and industry experts.  Some or part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for nformation solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   Technical questions should be directed to:  Keiji Tasaki at 301-286-6724 or Yen Wong at 301-286-7446. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Klaus Sexton at 301-286-2271. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.	A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Petroleum Refiners - New Small Business Size Standard - Final Rule
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has modified the small business size standard for petroleum refiners for purposes of Federal Government procurement.   The modification consists of the following: (1) increasing the capacity component of the standard from 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 125,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd); (2) defining capacity in bpcd; and (3) measuring a refiner's total Operable Atmospheric Crude Oil Distillation Capacity.  This is a better definition of what size a refiner must be to qualify as a small refiner for the Federal Government's procurement of refined petroleum products.  SBA is not changing the 1,500 employee size standard for this industry.


The rule is effective April 28, 2003.

You may read and/or download the rule, published in the March 28, 2003, Federal Register, on SBA's web site at http://www.sba.gov/indexwhatsnew.html.
