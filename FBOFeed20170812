<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, has a requirement for repair access road and visitor's parking lot at Hannibal Locks and Dam, Ohio River near Hannibal, in Monroe County. The work covered by this contract consists of the contractor furnishing all material, labor, layout of work, and supervision. The general description of the proposed project includes removing the existing pavement and the construction of new aggregate base course and bituminous concrete pavement for the access road and parking areas at the project, removing and resetting parking bumpers, and pavement markings. The existing asphalt concrete surface exhibited block and alligator cracking with crack widths exceeding 1-inch. The road has not been sealed and maintained regularly over the past 10 years. The site is relatively flat but the road appears to positively drain with the exception of two (2) areas along the entrance drive (615 SY total) which exhibited localized potholes, pavement edge cracking and general road base failure.<br /><br />The project intent is to improve the existing bituminous entrance road and visitor parking lot area which have reached the end of their respective useful service lives. The entrance drive area is approximately 1500 SY and the visitor parking lot area proposed for improvement is approximately 1100 SY (2600 SY total improvement area). It should be noted that this is likely the first phase of paving at Hannibal Locks and Dam; future paving projects will be required to complete resurfacing or replacement of additional existing parking lots located on the facility property.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the proposed work is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a 100% set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns. The resulting award will be for one (1) Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract. All responsible offerors are encouraged to participate. The work shall be completed within 270 calendar days after written Notice to Proceed. The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued approximately 28 July 2017, online through Federal Business Opportunities (FBO.gov), therefore, requests for hardcopies of the solicitation will not be honored. In order to receive notification of any amendments to this solicitation, interested vendors must register as an interested vendor on the FBO.gov website. If you are not registered, the Government is not responsible with providing notification of any changes to this solicitation. Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) before receiving a contract award (go to www.sam.gov to register). The NAICS for this procurement is 237310, "Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction" and the small business size standard is $36,500,000 Million.<br /><br />ATTENTION: For companies new to the Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, the link below will take you to a training Powerpoint slide presentation which will provide information essential to new contractors to help them navigate our bidding process. It will also help them to make their bid-no bid decision as it contains information on what will be required on a Post-Award performance basis - submittals, timelines, deadlines &amp; milestones, necessary paperwork you need to supply, etc. This will help you capture everything needed in your bid so that there are no surprises later on.

<p>SUPTXT 5252.204-9400<br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a security upgrade project at the Carol Stream IL P&amp;DC located at 500 Fullerton Ave, Carol Stream IL 60199-9080. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,100,000 to $1,500,000 with construction completion within 365 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1)Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2)Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3)Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4)Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5)Company must submit information for three comparable buildout projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE USPS CAROL STREAM IL P&amp;DC ON WEDNESDAY AUGUST 23, 2017, AT 10:00 A.M. CDT LOCATED AT 500 FULLERTON AVE, CAROL STREAM IL. 60199-9080. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>

The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The mission of The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. This request will enable NCATS and the Bioprinting group to optimize Tissue Engineering techniques by increasing capabilities, flexibility and throughput. This will ultimately increase the capability to optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; and perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content screening (HCS).</p>
<p>The Probe Development group is part of The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The Probe Development group utilizes 3D bioprinting techniques to generate tissues which will be used to perform studies into causes and treatments of various diseases. This approach can provide data more relevant to the whole-body response than traditional studies which use two-dimensional cell cultures. Initial research is being performed to advance fabrication techniques and protocols.</p>
<p>3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing technique to build three-dimensional live tissue structures that mimic natural in vitro live tissue. Live cells are harvested and dispensed into spatially controlled patterns in a layer by layer approach to generate three dimensional arrangements. The created structures undergo further biological treatment until they form tissue like morphology. The tissues may subsequently be used for therapeutic and research purposes.<br />As part of tissue manufacturing, large volumes of cells must be grown and cultured in a cell culture laboratory. In order to store the cells, a Cryogenic -150C Freezer is required to keep the cells viable and easily accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />This request is to procure one Brand Name Mechanical Cryogenic -150C Freezer is required to enable the tissue printing group to store large quantities of cells and maintain cell viability by providing storage below the -130C glass transition temperature of water.  <br />Project Requirements</p>

The IOI is a sewer line conveying Mexican and domestic sewage to the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant in Rio Rico, AZ. The IOI runs adjacent to and in some instances, crosses the Potrero Creek (also called the Nogales Wash). During a recent rainstorm, manhole no. 89 was damaged during flooding. Due to the level of the water remaining in the creek, the extent of the damage has not yet been determined. However, it has been confirmed that sewage from the IOI is discharging into the creek through the manhole. Emergency sewage bypass system and repair a damaged manhole structure along the IOI sewer to stop the sewage discharge into the Potrero Creek and replace a manhole structure to prevent further sewage spills. The Contractor will bypass sewage flows around the breached manhole and then perform needed repairs for the manhole structure.</span></p>
