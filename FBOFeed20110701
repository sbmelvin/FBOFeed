This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is Premo Plastics.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  The aerial ignition device (sphere), also known as "ping pong balls", is a container 32 mm (1.25 inches) in diameter containing approximately 3.0 grams of potassium permanganate used in support of wildland backfiring operations.  Premo Plastics Aerial Ignition Devices are the only approved devices for use with the Premo MarkIII Dispenser.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $500,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 325998 All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing applies.  Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item L11PS00798, however, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received by July 7, 2011 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Premo Plastics for the requirement stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kathy Colson at 208-387-5545 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<DESC><p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Open Source Indicators (OSI) Program on August 3, 2011, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide introductory information on OSI and the research problems that the program aims to address, to respond to questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and find potential team partners. This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.<br /><br />PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br /><br />Many significant societal events are preceded and/or followed by population-level changes in communication, consumption, and movement. Some of these changes may be indirectly observable from publicly available data, such as web search trends, blogs, microblogs, internet traffic, webcams, financial markets, and many others. Published research has found that many of these data sources are individually useful in the early detection of events such as disease outbreaks and macroeconomic trends. However, little research has examined the value of combinations of data from diverse sources. <br /><br />The OSI Program seeks to develop methods for continuous, automated analysis of publicly available data in order to anticipate and/or detect societal disruptions, such as political crises, disease outbreaks, economic instability, resource shortages, and natural disasters. The Program will aim to develop methods that "beat the news" by fusing early indicators of events from multiple data sources and types. Anticipated innovations include: development of empirically-driven sociological models for population behavior change in anticipation of, and response to, events of interest; collection and processing of publicly available data that represent those population behavior changes; development of data extraction techniques that focus on volume, rather than depth, by identifying shallow features of data that correlate with events; development of multivariate time series models robust to non-stationary, noisy data to reveal patterns that precede events; use of Granger causality, Phase Slope Index measures, or other novel techniques to estimate causality in time series; training of classifiers to weight combinations of time series for generating probabilistic warnings of events. <br /><br />OSI will not fund research on U.S. events, the identification or movement of specific individuals, collection mechanisms that require directed participation by individuals, or advanced natural language processing. It is expected that performers will use existing, off-the-shelf technologies to extract features of interest in publicly available data, and that research will focus on methods for correlating combinations of data with events. <br /><br />Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers will be encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary, and might include social scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, content extraction experts, and information theorists.<br />IARPA anticipates that academic institutions and companies from around the world will participate in this program. Researchers will be encouraged to publish their findings in academic journals. <br /><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br /><br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00 pm Eastern time, July 27, 2011 at <a href="https://conference.brtrc.com/OSI_pd/Overview.aspx">https://conference.brtrc.com/OSI_pd/Overview.aspx</a>. Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed. <br /><br />Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 150 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br /><br />The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation &amp; Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for teaming opportunities may submit a request through the registration web site. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations. This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar organizations that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment or real property, will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete. <br /><br />IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference. <br /><br />Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to <a href="mailto:dni-iarpa-events@ugov.gov">dni-iarpa-events@ugov.gov</a>.<br /><br />Questions regarding the program can be sent to <a href="mailto:dni-iarpa-baa-11-11@ugov.gov">dni-iarpa-baa-11-11@ugov.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>Steam is produced at 150 psi by up to six steam generators located in the Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant (4 nameplate-rated at 44,000 lb/hr and 2 rated at 80,000 lb/hr). There are four (4) Union Iron Works boilers at 55MBtu/hr and two (2) English Boiler &amp; Tube, Inc. at 99.8 MBtu/hr currently installed and operational. All boilers are dual-fired for natural gas and No. 2 fuel oil. The 4 Union Iron Works boilers are original to the facility, installed in 1962, and are to be upgraded for this requirement. . There have been several construction upgrades to the feedwater systems, condensate and fuel pumps, water treatment and other ancillary systems over the last 15 years, and a major project to replace and upgrade central plant controls was completed in April 2011. The NIST facility currently operates the heating plant under and MDE permit with an expiration date of April 30, 2013, and it is anticipated that compliance with stricter visible, NOx, and Sulfur Dioxide emission standards will be required for all future projects on Boilers 1-4.<br /><br />The owner seeks to improve the energy efficiency and air emission discharge performance of the existing Boilers 1 thru 4. The requirement is for the replacement of existing burners, forced draft fans, wind boxes, natural gas trains of Boilers 1-4 at the NIST Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant with new Low NOx packaged burners, forced draft fans, wind boxes, natural gas trains and auxiliaries. The new burner/fan assemblies will feature state-of-the-art variable speed drives for FDF's, installation of economizers, and new electrical services and control devices. The design is planned such that each pair of boilers demolition and construction work can be performed over the summer months and requires keeping the facility capacity for steam generation at 80,000 lb/hour plus 1 boiler redundancy. <br /><br />THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. The standard classification NAICS code is 236210 -- Industrial Building Construction.

<p>SUBJECT: Production and Calibration Radioactivity Standard Reference Materials</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB682040-11-03127</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: July 15, 2011</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, 301-975-8802</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with NRMAP, INC. of St. Louis, Missouri for the Production and Calibration of Radioactivity Standard Reference Materials under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or<br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>This requirement is for the development and continued certification of radioactivity standard reference materials. These particular SRM's are unique as they are essential for calibration and measurement assurance programs in the field of nuclear medicine. NRMAP, inc. is the only company that can produce the SRMs in a timely manner. If the program were to continue without NRMAP, it would require a NIST senior scientist and technician at least one man-year to train replacements . - Plus delays in setting up the distribution network which could amount to as much as a year. Any other company would necessitate significant research and development and cause undue difficulties and delays for NIST.</p>
<p>As a result NRMAP, INC. is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's needs. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990, and the size standard is $7 M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on July 15, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to recompete requirements currently being performed under NIA Contract HHSN260200400003C. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 112990. It is anticipated that a single indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contract will be awarded for a 9-year period of performance beginning on or about February 5, 2012, with an anticipated level of effort of approximately 1.0 FTEs in year 1, 1.8 FTEs in year 2, 2.4 FTEs in year 3, 3.4 FTEs in each of years 4-7, 2.6 FTEs in year 8, and 1.5 FTEs year 9. This contract is proposed to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined and calorically laboratory rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.
<p>NIA funded research programs using rodents to model aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain animal models suitable for the study of biological and behavioral processes in aging. Caloric restriction, in which the calories are restricted to maintain a stable adult body weight but all other nutritional needs are met, is a proven intervention to extend lifespan and improve health. Calorically restricted rodents are used to investigate the cellular and physiological biology of normal aging. A colony of aged, calorically restricted laboratory rodents, of defined genetic backgrounds and health status, is an integral part of the NIA's program of research on aging. In 2004, NIA awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of caloric restricted rodents and this RFP is for development of a new contract to continue this resource.</p>
<p>This will be a nine (9) year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract under which the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, caloric restricted rodents of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. Although several different Task Orders will be issued, the expected duration of this colony is nine (9) years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the last two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year nine.<br />&emsp;<br />The colony population at the end of each year of the nine year period should be approximately as follows:</p>
<p>YEAR 1 400 YEAR 4 2800 YEAR 7 2800<br />YEAR 2 1600 YEAR 5 2800 YEAR 8 1600<br />YEAR 3 2800 YEAR 6 2800 YEAR 9 Near 0</p>
<p>This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be helicobacter-negative. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for two inbred strains of mice from a stock center identified by the COTR and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the two inbred strains and one derivative hybrid strain. Rats will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 1260 animals/year.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment. Since this is an aging colony, the Contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 3-4 years.</p>
<p>Animals shall be provided with sterilized laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 (Rader et al., 1986, J. Nutrition 116:1777-88) diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount. Caloric restricted animals shall be fed the prescribed daily food amount once per day. The following items shall be controlled within the ranges specified: temperature (72-79oF), humidity (40-70%), light cycles (12/12 hours), air circulation (0.25m/hr/animal) and filtration (HEPA), and water chlorination and acidification (water shall be chlorinated and the pH controlled so as to not exceed pH 7.3 and 7-8 PPM chlorination at discharge end). A maximum of 25% re-circulated air within the barrier is allowed. Current ILAR (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html/index.html) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) for breeding, care and maintenance of laboratory rats shall apply where specifications have not been detailed. Animals shall be monitored weekly for signs of fighting or morbidity.</p>
<p>Semi-annual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies and quarterly health monitoring of the aging colonies shall be performed and reported to the COTR as well as be included in the semi-annual progress reports. Genetic monitoring shall be accomplished by a panel of microsatellite markers that distinguish the inbred strains. Health monitoring shall include external exams for parasites, microbiology, serology, and histology.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship the animals to investigators upon authorization from the COTR, providing secure shipping crates, food and water sources, and climate-controlled transport. Shipment via dedicated, climate-controlled truck is the preferred method. The Contractor shall invoice customers for the cost of the animals (determined by the COTR) and all shipping costs, and apply the remittance to the cost of the contract. The Contractor shall account for all received funds on the monthly invoices. The Contractor shall weekly provide an inventory of the aging colony in a format approved by the COTR.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA,  has a requirement for spare parts in support of  BRU-55 A/A Bomb Racks.  The Government intends to procure on an other than full and open competition with ITT Defense, the following items:  1) MT55M1153-2 (MCA) Micro Controller Assembly, Qty 7 each;  2) MT55M1190-1 (DIA) Digital Interface Assembly, Qty 5 each;  3) MT55M1131-1 (PRA) Power Raid Assembly, Qty 14 each;  4) MT55E1205-3 BRU-55 Cable Assembly, Qty 3 each.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, ITT Defense, 1650 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1700, McLean, VA 22102.  The products under this effort shall be purchased in accordance with a Statement of Work, including Specifications.
  A 5 - year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-10-G-JM39 for firm fixed price supplies is in place, and this soliciation will result in a Delivery Order for Firm Fixed Price supplies under aforementioned BOA.  Inspection will be made by DCMA at Origin, Acceptance will be at destination.  
The BRU-55A/A bomb rack is the U.S. Navys first smart multiple carriage bomb rack.  The BRU-55A/A is an upgrade to the current BRU-33A/A Canted Vertical (CVER) bomb rack that provides compatibility with convention stores and improved umbilical retention. 

It would not be cost effective (substantial duplication of development and certification costs), and it would take too long to develop and certify an alternate source of supply for the BRU-55A/A Bomb Rack subcomponents.

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source; however, intersted persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
  The government will consider all proposals received prior to the anticipated closing date, and written responses shall clearly show the firm's capability, background, experience and assets necessay to produce the required parts without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability and delivery of the products to the war fighter.  This notice is not a request for proposals; however, any firm, other than ITT Defense should respond in accordance with Numbered Notes 22.  Questions should be directed to Roger Smith, by email to roger.h.smith@navy.mil

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to award a sole source purchase order to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (MS2) (LMC), PO Box 4840, Syracuse, NY 13221-4840, for a continuation of basic research for the development of unique mathematical and statistical algorithms.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has requested that the LMC CAD/CAC algorithms be adapted to a variety of systems and demonstrate this capability over the next several years. This specific effort will involve the extension of these algorithms to another sensor system for the Naval Facilities Command.  Only LMC has the unique knowledge base, the facilities, and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.
  The algorithms are very sophisticated and require specialized knowledge to use properly thus another vendor cannot cost-effectively duplicate them.

Simplified Acquisition Procedures is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 541330 (Engineering Services) and the FSC Code is R425 (Engineering Technical Services).  The SBA Size Standard is $4.5 Million.  Results will be delivered to the Naval Surface Warfare Center  Panama City Division (N61331), c/o Naval Support Activity - Panama City N61008), Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

Companies interested in potential subcontracting opportunities with LMC should visit the Lockheed Martin supplier web site at http://www.lockheedmartin.com/suppliers/doingbusiness/.

The NSWC-PCD has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.
  Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at https://www.fbo.gov.  Vendors should regularly access this web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><br />The NAICS code for this action is 541712.</p>
<p>The Southeast Fisheries Science Center is collaborating with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) relative to conventional tagging of juvenile Bluefin tuna in the western North Atlantic. ICCAT is also conducting the same experiment in the eastern North Atlantic. It is imperative that both organizations use identical conventional tagging equipment in order to make appropriate comparisons of tag performance, shredding, and survival of these size categories while analyzing the results. For consistency between the SEFSC conventional tagging effort in the western North Atlantic and ICCT in the eastern North Atlantic, all tag types must be the same.</p>
<p>The conventional tags are to be used on school sized western North Atlantic Bluefin tuna. The National Marine Fisheries Services' tagging program has done considerable research in the past on developing a conventional tag with enhanced retention properties. The preferred design is made out of medical grade nylon and has double barbs. This tag was designed to be deployed as an intermuscular tag. The streamer portion of the tag with the tag legend is maintained with a mechanical attachment using shrink tubing. This tag has provided superior retention qualities.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the tags must submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Capability information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have previously furnished this item, and detailed narrative that describes your ability to provide this item as specified and descriptive literature. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at (816) 274-6993 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all contractors must have a Dun and Bradstreet number.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vemco, Inc for the purchase of V16 Telemetry Tags and VR2W Coded Acoustic Receivers (69Hz) with Bluetooth.
<p><br />The NAICS code for this action is 334290.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Mexico sturgeon ("Gulf sturgeon," Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) was listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1995. This status was a result of population decline due to heavy fishing mortality in the early twentieth century, as well as probable habitat loss in its historic range. More recently, the 2009 Gulf Sturgeon 5-Year Plan brought forward objectives for this species: 1) to prevent further reduction of existing wild populations of Gulf sturgeon within the range of the subspecies, 2) to establish population levels that would allow delisting of the Gulf sturgeon by management units, and 3) to establish a self-sustaining population that could withstand directed fishing pressure within management units. However, a draft report of the status of the Gulf sturgeon (Pine, in prep) found that trends in abundance were unreliable due to "low recapture rates and sparse data." Thus, based on the current information available, data do not exit to test objectives of the 5-Year Plan. The 2009 Gulf Sturgeon Working Group agreed that several research objectives needed to be set forth and met in order to fulfill the data needs of future assessments. The primary objective was to obtain reliable estimates of natural mortality (M) and abundance throughout the range of the Gulf sturgeon. A Sampling Protocol Meeting was organized and hosted by NMFS. The focus of this multi-year project is to facilitate these objectives by standardization of data collection methodology, and to collect the additional life history information that is lacking for this species.</p>
<p>In order to attain these objectives, a standardized protocol for estimating M was implemented, in which VEMCO VR2 W receivers will be used as "gates" at the mouths of the seven major rivers defined as critical habitat for this species. Each year for five years, five Gulf sturgeon from each river will be Implanted with VEMCO VR1 6 transmitters. To maintain the standardization of the project, and to maintain necessary consistency across the timeframe of this project, the Gulf Sturgeon Working Group decided to use only VEMCO receivers and transmitters. Because VEMCO receivers are proprietary, other types of transmitters may not be detected by the VEMCO receivers, thus allowing the Gulf sturgeon to leave the rivers undetected. Reliable tag detections are crucial for the success of this project; therefore, VEMCO receivers and tags are necessary. If the government cannot purchase VEMCO products to continue this monitoring program, we will lose data from previously purchased equipment because no other vendor will be able to provide the compatibility to those data that have already been recorded.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the V-16 Transmitters and VR2W Coded Acoustic Receivers (69Hz) with Bluetooth may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice.

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">&nbsp;The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Code 8200 (Spacecraft Engineering Department), is conducting a market research survey to 1) determine industry capabilities and potential offeror interest, 2) obtain information to refine the government&rsquo;s requirements in a final Statement of Work/Specifications document and 3) obtain Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) estimates of price/cost and delivery schedule for the design and delivery of one Microwave Imager/Sounder (MIS) Upper Air Sounder (UAS) Spectrometer as defined in the RFI NRL-11-SE01 Requirements Document. The UAS splits the IF signal and passes the signal to a Spectrometer that extracts the frequency spectrum of two 128 MHz BW channels with the center frequency of each channel being different. Sub channels of the frequency spectrum are recorded. Contiguous frequency spectrum sub channels are averaged for a specific time within the Spectrometer, and are then transmitted to the UAS Digital Processing Module (UDM) which packetizes and transmits sub channel data, along with housekeeping data to the Rotating Data Handling Unit (RDHU) over an RS422 HDLC serial link. </span></p>

The sole source requirement is to provide up to 80 indoor unreserved parking spaces for ICE employees with 24/7, 365 days a year access who work in offices that are located at Tech World at 800 K Street, NW Washington, DC<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>20536.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government has determined through market research that Interpark Holdings, Inc. is the only known company capable of providing the required parking spaces within close proximity. Close proximity is necessary to reduce the chances of physical harm from the elements, or from imposing difficulties related to security and safety of employees (including those with disabilities) as well as the chances of negatively impacting work place access for employees on call 24/7 who must be able to enter/exit the building with complete flexibility and without delay to conduct their assigned duties. This requirement will allow the agency to comply with Executive Order 12191, the Federal Ridesharing Program, which requires Federal Agencies to implement parking incentives to promote ridesharing, as well as promoting agency compliance with title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12181) which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations. The period of performance for this service is for a 12-month period with two (2) 12-month option periods. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting ICE's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement, may be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This notice satisfies the requirement of FAR 5.203 for publicizing contract opportunities and is not a notice for receipt of competitive quotes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses to this notice must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination not to award a sole source contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All questions should be directed to B.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Microanalysis Research Group of the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, Material Measurement Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Protochips, Inc., Raleigh, NC, for the purchase of a Liquid Flow TEM Holder and Liquid Cell System. <br />
<p><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: A NIST-owned FEI Tecnai TEM, equipped with a super-twin (ST) objective lens pole-piece, is used for experiments at NIST. NIST has a requirement for a specimen holder that allows the imaging of microscopic structures in a flowing liquid environment within a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The imaging of nanostructures in a flowing liquid environment in the TEM requires two separate components: a liquid flow TEM holder, which transports the flowing liquid from outside of the TEM to the specimen stage area of the TEM column; and a microlithographically fabricated liquid cell equipped with electron-transparent windows, which allows the nanostructures in the encapsulated liquid to be imaged. This Liquid Flow TEM Holder and Liquid Cell system must be compatible with the existing NIST-owned FEI TEM instrument.</p>
<p>Based on the above, Protochips, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required Liquid Flow TEM Holder and Liquid Cell system that meets the Government's minimum requirements and is 100% compatible with the existing FEI TGM. Protochips, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 15, 2011, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Mr. Michael L. Springer (MLS Consulting) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 for the following services: project planning management, building and work space planning, building consolidation, and prospectus and building lease consulting services. These services shall support the NRC's Three White Flint North (3WFN) Project, consolidation of NRC staff to the White Flint Complex and the extension of the agency's Two White Flint North (TWFN) building lease. The execution and completion of these projects require considerable knowledge of NRC requirements and policies along with close coordination between the General Service Administration (GSA), building developer, architect, general contractor and local government organizations. Mr. Springer possesses unique experience with these requirements. He led the only other NRC building consolidation team that negotiated the lease of the TWFN building. Additionally, he initiated and led the NRC's negotiations with GSA and the TWFN building owner to acquire Lot Number 4 and to extend the NRC's 10 year lease of TWFN. Finally, Mr. Springer has served in several key positions responsible for managing space planning and acquiring interim and permanent space to house staff. Mr. Springer is the only known individual who can provide the NRC with the required services without encountering delays in the project. Delays would be a result of an individual having to learn the details of the current projects. If the NRC should fail to retain Mr. Springer, the selection of another contractor would likely contribute to project delays, adversely impact the project schedule and result in the NRC paying approximately $1.3 million per month for each one month delay in occupying 3WFN. The period of performance is September 29, 2011 through September 28, 2012, with a one-year option. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to James Leedom, Contract Specialist at James.Leedom@nrc.gov and Valerie Whipple, Sr. Contract Specialist, at Valerie.whipple@nrc.gov.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT's) Office of Security plans to award a contract, purchase order or delivery order to Advanced Management Technology, Inc. for services in the area of application development and maintenance support on DOT's Investigations Tracking System (ITS) database, with a 12 month base year and four one year option periods. The contractor may also be required to provide as-needed program and/or operational system support. In addition to the specific support areas outlined above, the contractor shall support any future technologies that are adopted by the government to improve the DOT Investigations Tracking System (ITS) application. <br />DOT's Investigations Tracking System (ITS) was expected to be completed within the timeframe of the initial contract (DTOS59-07-F-10002) awarded in FY 2007. However, due to the additions of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and various other Federal requirements the completions of the systems was not possible. The additional requirements require complex and major programming changes, many of which will be on going for some time. <br />USDOT has not explored any other option for acquiring the application development and maintenance support, because Advanced Management Technology, Inc. is author of the ITS system and it would not be cost effective to switch contractors at this critical point of the systems development. <br />Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than Advanced Management Technology, Inc. will be able to provide this product. <br />Nevertheless, any entity, other than IES Interactive Training USA which believes they can provide the needed product to OIG shall submit a capability statement to Pamala.millbrook.ctr@dot.gov no later than 12:00 PM EST on July 15, 2011. <br />

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at </span><a href="http://www.wawftraining.com/"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wawftraining.com</span></a><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Central Registration database </span>and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.wawftraining.com </span>is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. </span></p>

PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).<br><br>c) Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:<br><br>		Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*<br>		Purple:		Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*<br>		Green:		Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*<br>		Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*<br>		Red:		Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*<br><br>*If all supplier performance for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.<br><br>d) Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's Weighted Delivery Score.  Delivery scores are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor, which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.<br><br>e) PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each suppliers and can be reviewed at www.ppirs.gov Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at www.ppirs.gov  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the afore-mentioned website.<br><br>52.215-4583	Disclosure of Unit Prices (Local Clause)<br><br>Unless the Offeror notifies the contracting officer of an objection to disclosure of its unit price (prior to submission of its initial proposal), it is the Government's intent to publicly release (which would include, but is not limited to, a public award synopsis, contractor debrief, procurement history web posting, or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request) the unit price(s) stated in the contract awarded under this solicitation.  Any objection must be submitted in writing, providing a detailed explanation of how release of the awarded unit price would result in substantial competitive harm to the contractor.  Objections will be reviewed to determine whether harm has been substantiated.  Failure to timely notify the contracting officer waives any objection to disclosure of the unit price.  A "unit price" is defined as the specified amount to be paid by the Government for the goods or services stated per unit, contract line item, or separately identified contract deliverable.  The term "unit price" does not include any information on how the unit price was determined.  This constitutes notification pursuant to Executive Order 12600.<br><br>52.225-14	Inconsistency Between English and Translation of Contract<br><br>52.228-3	Workers' Compensation Insurance (Defense Base Act)<br><br>52.232-1	Payments<br><br>52.232-11	Extras<br><br>52.232-4501	U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island, IL<br><br>52.233-2	Service of Protest<br><br>52.233-4503	AMC-Level Protest Program<br><br>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.

This area covers zip codes that begin with 120-139.

The contract will be subject to negotiation of individual work orders.  In each instance total fees for services will not exceed $250,000.00 for each task.

A separate Part II for each branch office that has a key role on the team, and a separate Part II for each consultant must be provided.  Contrary to the general instructions, this office does not maintain a file of Part II due space limitations.  In Part I, you must limit the number of projects listed to ten (10) projects only.

It is prohibited to pay any fee, commission, and percentage or brokerage fee to any person or firm contingent upon, or resulting from award of a contract.

(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;

(5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,
(6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.
(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden compliance with the boycott, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above:<BR><BR>(1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:
(i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,

(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;
(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;
(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;
(5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individuals family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,
(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.<BR><BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision:
Foreign person means any person other than a United States person as defined below.
United States person means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as provided under the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended.

Notice is hereby provided that the Standing Solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule 00CORP - Consolidated Services has been refreshed.  This new solicitation number FCO-00-CORP-0000C, Refresh #13 will replace solicitation number FCO-00-CORP-0000C, Refresh #12, posted on February 3, 2011 and includes updated clauses and provisions.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 9 months before your offer is evaluated. 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Offerors are responsible for payment to Open Ratings, Inc. for past performance evaluation prior to submission of an offer.
The Consolidated Schedule program is an acquisition vehicle that streamlines the acquisition process.  Offers may be submitted for evaluation to obtain a single contract for multiple schedule business lines that fall within the scope of participating schedules.  Existing schedule contractors may migrate to obtain a single contract as an alternative to holding multiple (2 or more) schedule contracts.  Offers and migration requests will only be evaluated under this schedule program when the offer/migration proposes 2 or more schedule business lines.  See Part I, Section entitled Goods & Services of the solicitation for detailed information on participating schedules.
This solicitation is open continuously with no closing date. The resultant contracts are awarded as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity; Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Contract periods commence on the Date of Award through a 5-year base period with three 5-year option periods. The resultant contracts provide a streamlined acquisition approach to fulfilling requirements that fall within the scope of more than one schedule for acquiring a total solution. Agency ordering procedures for services and further information on the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program may be found at www.gsa.gov/schedules.   
GSA is only issuing this solicitation/request for proposal through the FedBizOpps internet site, GSA will not provide paper copies of this solicitation.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Procurement Section (PS) would like to provide a structured Professional Development Program (PDP) consistent with continuous learning needs for their procurement professionals to enhance their awareness, knowledge, competencies, and capabilities through learning and experience by using, capturing, and sharing knowledge to the overall benefit of the FBI's mission requirements. The overall objective is to create an evolutionary-future environment where employees are engaged and encouraged to take a leadership role in identifying and solving problems that benefit the procurement workforce, the customer and the FBI's mission needs.
<p>In order to create this environment the FBI PS believes that contracting professionals must not only have technical competence and broad contracting experience; but they must also demonstrate: <br />- Leader Competence<br />- Business Acumen<br />- Networking and Interpersonal Skills<br />- Customer Relationship Skills<br />- Embracing Accountability<br />- Listening Skills <br />- Coaching and Change Management Skills<br />- Communications Skills<br />- Sense of Community - with all players in the Acquisition Process<br />- Mutual Valuing</p>
<p>These values should be reflected in the PDP through all of the courses taught so that the contracting professional may hone their abilities as a competent and successful business professional, FBI mission partner and leader. The courses should be specifically tailored to provide skill set advancement for all contracting professionals in varying experience levels and background.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Entry-Level<br />The FBI PS has identified three tiers in which these courses should be grouped. The First Tier (Tier 1) will provide the path for contracting professionals who are in the beginner to novice phase of their profession. These entry level courses, taught to GS 7-11 contracting professionals, will reflect the values listed above, and provide a leadership foundation that the CO and CS will take with them throughout their career. Themes should be focused on what and why more than how.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Mid-Level<br />The Second Tier (Tier 2) will provide the skills needed for those contracting professionals who are beginning to come into their own as FBI leaders. These courses will be taught to GS 12-14 contracting professionals, and will reflect the values above, with an emphasis on mission value. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with not only what and why, but the how, and provide these professionals the ability to take ownership of their skills. The courses should also reflect a participant input into learning about and developing their own leadership style. The Tier 2 professional should be approached in a manner consistent with their previous experience, with a lens towards the future challenges of becoming a true leader within the FBI.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Senior Level<br />The Third Tier (Tier 3) training will provide awareness for the experienced contracting professionals, who have been in a leadership role for some years, to shape those leaders coming in and provide the skills necessary to provide daily guidance to future leaders. Tier 3 contracting professionals will be GS-15 professionals who have provided the government with years of service in either a leadership or professional role. The courses in this tier should provide the contracting professional with the ability to pass on their skills, and foster an environment in which budding contracting professionals are encouraged to take ownership of their responsibilities and provide opportunities for the leaders of the future to develop and move into future roles. Themes should have a high-level focus, with a view towards the future of FBI contracting and creating an environment and legacy of success.<br /><br />Please Send all Questions</p>

<DESC>Today's 3D cameras and displays offer solutions to entertainment markets. These displays provide a single perspective of a scene (e.g., videogames, movie theaters), or else dynamic multi-perspectives to a single viewer with and without special glasses, using head-tracking. Due to shortcomings in 3D effects from these technologies, prolonged viewing commonly leads to strain and discomfort.<br /><br />Analysts require visualization solutions for sustained and interactive exploration of massive and dynamic, fused 3D data from, for example, Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and overhead imagery. Solutions are needed that are compatible with a fast-paced, collaborative operational environment. Operational settings for visualization analysts constrain cost, size, weight and power, and impose demanding human factors requirements. The SHO Program addresses both the constraints and the requirements to enable safe, natural and effective 3D visualization for the operational environment.<br /><br />SHO seeks dynamic, high-performance, synthetic holographic 3D workstation display systems, simultaneously viewable by multiple people with the unaided eye. Low-profile display prototypes are sought providing brilliant, power-efficient, high-resolution and full-color light-fields of 3D data possessing visually continuous perspectives with no detectable artifacts.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, the test program in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

All proposals shall reference the RFQ number and shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. local (central) time on 1 August 2011. The anticipated award date is 9 August 2011. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-52 dated 31 May 2011.  This acquisition is open for Full & Open Competition. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m. Contract line item numbers and quantities: CLIN 0001, Advanced Contraband Concealment Hands-On Training, FY 2011 only, 2 course iterations; 1 course iteration, 16-18 August 2011, Abilene, TX and 1 course iteration, date and location TBD; CLIN 0002, CMR Reporting; Vendors shall review the Statement of Work for a detailed list of course requirements and items to be submitted as part of their proposal.  The prices provided for each of the SUB CLINS above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center's (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work. Clarification for CLIN 0002: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendor's intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Government's stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance when combined, are significantly more important than Price. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Research Sea Turtle Bycatch Reduction in Coastal Gillnet Fishery<br />NOAA/NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE<br />SOUTHWEST REGION - CONTRACT STATEMENT OF WORK<br />NFFR5300-11-04760</p>
<p>I. Statement of Work</p>
<p>The NMFS Southwest Region has a need to research methods to reduce the bycatch of sea turtles in gillnet fisheries to lower this threat to sea turtles locally and where gillnets in coastal areas of the world important are widely used, to reduce this threat worldwide. This important research will improve the recovery of this endangered and threatened species. This research needs to take place in an area where sea turtles are found in high abundance in order to reach significant results in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>II. Background</p>
<p>A number of strategies have been developed to reduce sea turtle bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries while relatively few tools are available to reduce sea turtle bycatch in coastal fixed gears, such as gillnets. Further research is needed that examines the use of visual cues to deter sea turtles from interacting with coastal gillnets, thereby reducing sea turtle bycatch and mortality. Previous studies indicate that illuminated nets using green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and light sticks reduced sea turtle captures in Baja California, Mexico by 41% and 60% respectively and has no significant impact on commercial catch. Some net illumination techniques may be expensive or impractical for fishermen to use in lesser developed countries, and continued investigation into inexpensive and effective approaches is needed. One promising avenue involves the potential differences in the visual acuity of sea turtles and commercially-important species of fish relative to ultraviolet (UV) light. Specific questions that should be addressed include determining the effects of illuminating gillnets with UV on fishing operations both with respect to target and bycatch species catch rates. Findings generated from this work should be transferable to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles in coastal gillnet fisheries worldwide.</p>
<p>III. Description of Work and Services</p>
<p>C. Working with local fishers in Baja California, Mexico, the contractor will incorporate ultraviolet illumination and/or other illumination techniques into gillnets (experimental nets) and compare these with traditional nets (control nets). Using a paired testing methodology, the contractor will test whether the experimental nets reduce sea turtle catch rates. Nets will be deployed during the night in an area known to have high turtle catch rates. Nets will be monitored throughout the night to remove captured turtles and ensure their health and survival. Captured turtles will be tagged, measured, and released.<br />D. All research will be analyzed and submitted in report form to NMFS-Southwest Regional Office. Research results will be written up for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journal and/or presented at scientific meetings.</p>
<p>IV. Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The proposal will be evaluated on the following factors by the Southwest Regional Sea Turtle Recovery Coordinator: <br />a. Demonstration of ability to conduct research in cooperation with local fishermen in Baja California, Mexico.<br />b. Demonstration of potential for obtaining successful experimental results with sea turtle bycatch and target catch rates significant enough to evaluate. <br />c. Demonstration of technical experience conducting sea turtle research and similar experimentation with commercial fishing gear.<br />d. Demonstration of understanding related to previous research in gillnet illumination studies and the ability to effectively analyze and report on research results.</p>
<p>V. Deliverables</p>
<p>All deliverables will be submitted to the Government Project Officer.</p>
<p>01 Not later than September, 2011, provide a short field report of work to date update (written or verbal) to NMFS. <br />02 Not later than March, 2012, finish analyzing data and submit draft report to NMFS.<br />03 Not later than May, 2012, submit final report to NMFS.</p>

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS - MANDATORY:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Branch of Regional Research, has a requirement for an elemental analyzer. This is a Brand Name or Equal requirement to an Elementar Americas Inc. product of One (1) Vario ISOTOPE Cube - CNS - IRMS - CHNS Analyzer (Part # 15.00-0000), with the standard 80 position autosampler.
The purpose of this requirement is for an elemental analyzer that can be connected to our 4 existing IsoPrime or Optima stable isotope mass spectrometers as needed for simultaneous analysis of organic samples for C-N-S-H isotopes and C-N-S-H elemental abundances. We want to be able to analyze all three isotopes from a single sample instead of having to do separate analyses for C-N and then for S isotopes using separate samples. This instrument will also provide a replacement for our two 15-20 year old elemental analyzers used for separate analyses of C-N isotopes and S isotopes on our Optima and IsoPrime mass spectrometers. It will also allow us to analyze smaller samples, at higher precisions, and more samples at the same time. Please refer to the salient characteristics (minimum requirements) under Technical Specifications to review the needs of this item.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division <br />1900 Half Street, SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3692</p>

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.Jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>Government Representative (POINT OF CONTACT)<br />Jamie Sanchez Jamie.a.Sanchez@uscg.mil (703) 313-5849 of the US Coast Guard USCG Navigation Center (NAVCEN)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Background</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard (USCG) vessels require updated electronic charts in ELECTRONIC NAUTICAL CHARTS (ENC) and RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS (RNC) format for their areas of operation, which includes U.S., Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean waters, as well as select other areas. Most electronic navigational charts for the U.S. waters are available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Charts for non-U.S. waters will need to be acquired from or produced on the authority of various International Hydrographic Offices. To support this requirement, the Coast Guard is seeking a contract for the continued monthly distribution of updated charts for these geographic areas, delivered on CD-ROM at set intervals and times, to USCG vessels for use with their navigation systems. The Coast Guard's goal is to ensure that USCG vessels are provided with the most current and up-to-date electronic navigational charts available. By utilizing the services of a commercial contractor who is familiar with both International and United States electronic charting standards, the Coast Guard believes it can more effectively and efficiently provide updated navigational charts to USCG vessels and overcome inconsistencies that can occur from the constant changing of personnel and the broad range of computer skills.</p>

<DESC>CLARIFICATION POSTED ON JULY 1, 2011<br /><br />The original posting of Question #7 listed an incorrect reference. The correction is as follows:
<p>7. Will this software support Electronic Information Management Standards - DoD 5015.2 requirements?</p>
<p><br />**************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Reference Explanation</p>
<p>Although the Division of Select Agents and Toxins does not work to DOD standards,&nbsp;NARA Bulletin 2003-03 states the following:</p>
<p>This bulletin advises agencies that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) endorses version 2 of the Department of Defense Electronic Records Management Software Application Design Criteria Standard (DoD 5015.2-STD, June 2002) for use by all Federal agencies.<br />**************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The government declines to answer vendor technical questions in an effort not to bias vendor input. As stated in the RFI "The sole purpose of this RFI is to assist CDC in understanding the solution provider landscape, identify good ideas and strategies, and avoid solicitation or contracting parameters which would be detrimental to CDC's mission or industry's ability to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions. CDC does not plan to respond back to companies that submit responses to this RFI except perhaps to ask a clarifying question regarding a response provided."<br /><br />The response date for this RFI is extended to July 12, 2011 at 2:00pm (Eastern) to accomodate any revisions to responses that this clarification may require.</p>

The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Zambia. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is 899,434 hours.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days.

<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis and end&nbsp;<strong>thirty (30) calendar days</strong> before proposals are due. Offerors may inquire about security risks by specific countries during this period. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>All announcements and amendments made to the solicitation will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov. To receive updates, click on "Register to Receive Notification". Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Larry Pruitt Jr. at PruittLA@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the offeror who submitted a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<a href="mailto:timothy.a.mickelson@us.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Forces Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) located in Huntsville, Alabama, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) (Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B)), intends to execute without competition a bilateral contract modification under contract W9113M-09-D-0001 (sole source, Modification 0008) to Johns Hopkins University Applied Research Laboratory (JHU/APL) to increase the current contract program ceiling amount (see details below).  The address for this organization is 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723-6099; Cage Code 88898. <br><br>A provision of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, as codified by 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(3)(B), authorizes non competitive contracts with educational institutions where necessary to establish or maintain essential engineering, research, and/or development capabilities. JHU is an approved University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) as authorized by the above statute and referenced in Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) UARC management plan dated 1 May 1996 and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEASYSCOM) ltr 5450 Ser 106/08-002 dated 30 October 2007.  The JHU, as a UARC, may not compete against industry in response to competitive Requests for Proposal (RFPs) for development or production that involve engineering expertise developed or sustained through this contract action in accordance with statute 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B).  This acquisition may receive a combination of both competitive and non-competitive funding from various Department of Defense (DoD) agencies under the authority previously cited. <br><br>JHU possesses an extensive breadth of capabilities and has been involved in broad programs of long term research and development of major DoD systems.  The scope of the tasks performed under this contract extend across several areas of science and technology to include many different warfare elements, and involve various types of activities from basic research, development, test and evaluation, systems innovations, integration and engineering in support of the DoD's warfighting capabilities. <br><br>The primary purpose of this notice is to publicize this contract action prior to contract modification, as mandated in FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and FAR Subpart 6.3 (Other Than Full and Open Competition).  The contract type will remain Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), not to exceed five years from the original date of award, 23 Feb 2009 through the curretn period of performance 22 Feb 2014.  The original contract action was awarded for $9.8M, a modification added $68.7M on 2 Mar 2011, and this modification will add $85.49M in ceiling to the contract, for a total IDIQ contract valued at $163.99M. <br><br>This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal. <br><br>The POC for this action is Timothy Mickelson, Contracting Officer, telephone number 256-955-4167 of FAX number 256-955-4240.

Vendors are also requested to identify any specifications which may drive excessive cost or technical risk.
  Vendors should address their ability to comply with all security requirements with respect to including a SAASM GPS within their system and whether a requirement for the use of a Government-furnished GB Gram may impact their design concept. 

Interested sources are requested to respond no later than 5:00pm EST on 15 JULY 2011 stating their CAGE Code, DUNS number, copy of GSA schedule(if appropriate), business size, SIC Code, and the complete contract information for a corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to:

<DESC>RECOVERY:&nbsp; THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; This notice represents the award of a modification to the existing contractor, National Heritage Insurance Company (NHIC) under the current contract number HHSM-500-2009-M0002Z in the amount of $92,551 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERORS.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009.&nbsp; The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology.&nbsp; Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.<br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.&nbsp; This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report.&nbsp; As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment).<br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.&nbsp; As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). Details follow:<br /><br />1)	GSA, Region 10 Design and Construction justification for other than full and open competition.<br />2)	Award of contract to SERA Architects<br />3)	Design of the Edith Green - Wendell Wyatt Federal Building Modernization.  Estimated value of $15,000,000<br />4)	Authority:  FAR 6.302-1<br />5)	The original design funding was appropriated by congress in 2004. The design contract was awarded under Brooks Act procedures to SERA Architects.  The project was about 50% designed in 2006 when congress decided not to fund the construction.  Therefore, the project was put on the shelf.   In 2009, the project was fully funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA).  GSA decided to re-start the A-E contract with SERA Architects to complete the design.  This honors the original Brooks Act selection and retains significant project knowledge, providing many production efficiencies.<br />6)	Other sources were considered, but it was determined that procurement and orientation would make the compressed duration requirements of the Recovery Act impossible. <br />7)	The anticipated total costs are fair and reasonable.<br />8)	Extensive market research was not conducted due to the considerations in 5 and 6.<br />&nbsp;

<DESC>This is a sole-source synopsis that provides tentative notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA4610-09-C-0004, Contractor Operated Civil Engineer Supply Store (COCESS) for a period of six months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 Nov 2011 through 30 Apr 2012. This extension is needed to satisfy the 30th Space Wing's (30SW) COCESS requirement until award of COCESS solicitation FA4610-10-R-0004 can be completed. Not awarding a six-month extension would cause serious injury to the Government. The extension will be performed by the incumbent contractor, Hallmark Phoenix 7, 12425 Chimney Rock Road, Houston, TX 77035-5545. A competitive small business set-aside was awarded on 31 Mar 2009 to provide COCESS for the 30SW, Vandenberg AFB, CA. The COCESS contractor acquires, issues, delivers and stores a variety of materials, equipment parts, and supplies for construction, facility maintenance, repair and support of the 30th Civil Engineer Squadron (30 CES). COCESS is a simplified method for authorized personnel to purchase quality material(s) used on work orders for construction, recurring maintenance, and repair in support of 30 CES. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg AFB operations described above. This six-month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This notice is being posted since this option under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award for FA4610-09-C-0004. This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8. This option exercise will further allow for the current procurement under FA4610-10-R-0004 to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. Hallmark Phoenix 7 is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to exercise of this option under FAR 52.217-8 within 15 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option exercise. A determination by the Government to exercise the aforementioned option clause and not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to exercise the option. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Vanessa Lech&oacute;n at e-mail address Vanessa.Lechon@vandenberg.af.mil.
