<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Afghanistan Procurement Support Office in Bangkok, Thailand, and in conjunction with the USAID Mission in Kabul, Afghanistan intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Afghanistan to solicit proposals from qualified organizations/institutions interested in implementing the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Development Activity.     Critical to the success of this program is maintaining a focus on enabling, rather than directing, the growth of the private sector.
 
The primary goal of this program is to increase the contribution of the private sector to economic growth in a minimum of four provinces including: Badakhshan, Nangarhar, Helmand and Heart, with the following objectives:  

1. Expand markets, increase access to information, and lower transaction costs.
2. Develop the workforce through technical, trade, accounting, and managerial training.
3. Create jobs through growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.
4. Promote domestic and foreign investment.
5. Compete internationally where Afghanistan has, or potentially has, a comparative advantage.
6. Develop Afghan domestic markets and improve productivity to help local products become competitive with imports.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this solicitation is 935. As such, this procurement is open to all offers from USAID Geographic Code (Source, Origin and Nationality) 935 which include all countries, except for those designated by the US Government as foreign policy restricted countries. The current foreign policy restricted countries are as follows: Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

USAID anticipates awarding a single award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The period of performance will be 3 years with two one year options. The RFP is expected to be issued on March 14, 2006 and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued on the website along with the RFP. Please check the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) periodically.

Any questions should be submitted via email to the point of contact at: apsobangkok@usaid.gov.

Please do not contact USAID/Afghanistan in Kabul directly, since all communication must be through this office.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

This acquisition is 100% set-aside for eligible 8(a) firms.  8(a) firms must meet the Small Business Administrations (SBA) criterion, and have previously been certified by the SBA as an 8(a) firm, which have a NAICS Code 236220 having a size standard of $28.5 million average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years.  Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents (i.e., tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists etc.) must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award.  Incomplete packages will be returned without action.  The Joint Venture Agreement must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract.  Failure to obtain SBAs approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBAs request to the buying activity to terminate the award.  Offers from concerns other than 8(a) will not be considered.  The general description of work includes construction of a new free-standing research laboratory building.  This building is approximately 6,400 gross square feet, slab-on grade, single-story construction with a reinforced concrete foundation and masonry exterior walls with a built-up low-pitch roof.  A new equipment yard of approximately 1,650 square feet is to be constructed adjacent to the new building.  Also included is construction of a vertical circulation addition to the south end of the existing Building 6 (nearby the new building site), as well as selective renovation and building service and utility upgrades.  Building 6 contains approximately 12,500 square feet of occupiable space.  The selective renovation pertains primarily to building and fire code deficiencies.  The project includes a significant amount of underground utility work (most utilities are privately-owned) associated with the new building construction, the construction of the vertical circulation addition, and with new building services.  Asbestos abatement (flooring, pipe insulation, crawlspace earth excavation, and exterior finish) is included in the project scope.  During selective demolition, worker protection, handling and disposal of lead-based painted materials will be required.  Phases of work will be staggered to provide for completion of all work roughly around the same time and to minimize the amount of time that various sections of Building 6 will need to be vacant.  Part of Building 6 (existing labs on the north section of the first floor) will remain occupied during the work, requiring the utility work in this area to be accomplished during hours that can be accommodated by the tenants (primarily evenings and weekends).  Contract award is subject to availability of funds.  Performance period is 495 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  Project Magnitude is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Pre-Bid Conference/Site Visit is scheduled on/about 2/15/06 at 9:00 a.m.  Offer due date is 3/1/06 by 3:00 p.m. local time.  Solicitation documents and amendments will be available for download on the VA Business Opportunitites Website or the Fed Biz Opps website.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued.  Any and all question regarding this solicitation shall be in writing and sent to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) intends to issue a Request for Offer to the firm identified as CaseWare Technology located in Pleasant View, UT.  CaseWare Technology developed the FWS Fire Budgeting and AllocationSystem (FIREBASE) in its current configuration.  The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) utilizes the Successful Software Projects (SSP) development methodology for all computer system development.  CaseWare Technology is the only company known to FWS that uses SSP methodology.  The FIREBASE system is very unique.  The analysis engine is run by matrices to determine staffing and equipment requirements for fire suppression and prescription burning.  The matrices represent the adaption of the FWS fire management business rules for automated analysis.  CaseWare Technology is the sole company that understands the matrices and their associated business rules.  The matrices are quite complicated and fire management is a highly technical field.  In addition, CaseWare Technology developed the system and has proprietary information relative to the system and it is the only company capable of maintaining the FIREBASE computer system and issuing software upgrades.  The purpose of this procurement is to support  the Branch of Fire Management by maintaining and integrating updates to the computer software used to perform fire analysis (FIREBASE).  The Government requires analysis of fire activities on each field station, both wetland and prescribed fires, staffing (i.e. number of fire managers, support staff), equipment, and the associated budget to support fire activities.  Maintenance of FIREBASE may include any of the following:  changes to existing FIREBASE codes, user support for information technology (IT), headquarters staff through telephone or on-site assistance; analysis of enhancements for FIREBASE; basic system enhancements, Project Team meeting facilitation; headquarters IT staff training; assist field users of FIREBASE; post implementation reviews, update data and process models as needed; and documentation of application functions and help guidelines. The Government requires the following system integration enhancements:  FIREBASE upgrades must be compatible with Access 2000, Windows 2000, annual report capabilities and additional requirements as mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  This is a sole source contract for one base year and four (4) option periods.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Solicitation Number is DKNZ06AC001S for This is a Pre-solicitation Notice, the Request for Proposals will be issued on or about April 20, 2006.  The procurement is for the Telecommunications Maintenance and Follow-On Services for Government-owned Nortel switching systems located in the Omaha, NE metropolitan area.  .  If you are interested in the procurement, please watch for the RFP to be posted here on FBO.  GSA may also order equipment, services, new PBX systems and/or maintenance of existing systems, located within this geographic boundary. The Government may also utilize this contract as a source of supply for the purchase, installation, maintenance and miscellaneous services for Nortel proprietary instruments, key system equipment, and ancillary devices.  The Government has determined that ONLY Nortel Authorized Distributors can submit offers as prime contractors under this solicitation. All offerors submitting proposals must provide proof of their status as a Nortel Authorized Distributor. The proposing contractor will be required to furnish a current letter of good standing or a manufacturer’s support commitment letter from Nortel.  Brand Name Justification for Nortel is as follows:  (1) Maintenance Service from Nortel Authorized Distributors.  In order to maintain warranties on the equipment, the manufacturer requires maintenance services be provided by authorized distributors of the equipment.  Additionally, upper level technical support from the manufacturer (Nortel) is available only to authorized distributors.   Upper level technical support, which Nortel calls ETAS (Emergency Technical Assistance Service), is support from the highest level technical experts at the manufacturer (Nortel).  It is used to investigate, assess and solve problems which are too difficult or systemic to be solved by the local technicians.  If this service is not available some problems could potentially not be correctable, which could cause the system to be inoperable or unable to provide certain needed functions.  The risk of harm to the Government resulting from the loss of warranty protection and inability to provide adequate service to our customers is far greater than any short term financial savings that might be gained from having a non-authorized maintenance provider. (2) Telephone Sets.  The only options for desk telephone sets that can be used with the Nortel Meridian Option PBX’s in Omaha are basic analog, single line sets or Meridian digital sets.  The analog sets do not allow the user to easily access much of the functionality that is built into the PBX.  Some features are not available with an analog set, and others are available only by dialing a specific feature code for each feature.  Examples of commonly used features are call pickup, 3-way calling, transferring, call forwarding, speed dialing, call waiting and direct voice mail access.  Our experience has shown that most customers will not memorize and utilize the feature codes, and that they quickly become dissatisfied with the service.  On the other hand, the Meridian telephone sets manufactured by Nortel allow users to easily utilize these features by simply pressing a button on the telephone. (3) Nortel Electronic Circuit Cards.  Electronic circuit cards inserted into the PBX’s provide the connectivity and functionality of the equipment.  These cards are only manufactured by Nortel; there are no alternative manufacturers.  Nortel sells these cards only to registered owners or authorized distributors of the specific product.  

This procurement will be full and open competition restricted to Nortel authorized distributors with OEM Certifications.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The term of the contract will be a base period of one (1) year with four (4) one-year options.  The maximum value of this ID/IQ contract will be $900,000 over the 5 year life.  The minimum guaranteed amount will be $50,000 per year.  The solicitation will be available on or about April 20, 2006. This solicitation will be available on this FBO website or contact the Contracting Officer at Jackie.simington@gsa.gov.  Proposals will be due 4:00pm, local time, May 25, 2006.  Send inquiries and questions to Jackie Simington via email at Jackie.simington@gsa.gov or by Fax to (816) 823-3322.  A pre-proposal meeting will be held in Omaha, NE on Tuesday, May 9, 2006 at 1:00pm, please e-mail the form included in RFP, Section 1, to the Contracting Officer to reserve a slot.   For a site tour, tours will be conducted in Omaha following the Pre-proposal conference on May 9.   This procurement is full and open, and not set aside under FAR Part 19.

<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: bowers.joshua@epa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan which is seeking experienced vendors to design, fabricate, deliver, and install a freestanding mezzanine as described below. Specifications for a Freestanding Mezzanine Over Room 306: 	These specifications describe a freestanding structural steel mezzanine that will provide first floor HVAC and lighting support and second level storage above Room 306A and 306B at the EPA NVFEL.  All materials will be procured for the entire job, but the installation shall be done in two phases to minimize risk to computer equipment on the first level in 306A.  Photos in the RFQ will show the computer room and the areas above the drop ceiling.  Rooms 306A&B combined are 59' 4" x 29' 4" at the floor level and are enclosed by 10' high concrete block walls and 14' drywall up to the roof level at 24'.  The entire first floor area has a 5-6" mesh reinforced concrete floor with extra thick footings under the block walls.   The rooms have 20' clear span up to bottom steel of the building girder trusses.  The computer room has a 12" raised floor which will remain in place.  Illustrations of these walls, cells, and components in the area will be shown in the RFQ.  Installation shall be closely coordinated with the NVFEL because of the computer equipment and wiring, which can?t be shut down or removed easily. 	The contractor shall confirm the structural components of the proposed design (similar to many other mezzanines at NVFEL) and provide any corrections or comments to optimize the project.  The contractor shall have the materials fabricated, delivered, and installed to create a freestanding mezzanine in room 306B first to provide potential second level space that is accessible infrequently by limited personnel.  Room 306A will be done later after the computer servers can be relocated.  The government shall provide the area in a somewhat clear condition (the ceiling tiles will be removed and the grid will be partially cut apart) to facilitate the steel installation.   Existing fire sprinklers will also be removed and as many conduits rerouted as can be done effectively.  Because of the existing light conduits, the joists will be installed over or under them.  Some conduits and lighting fixtures will then be temporarily reattached to the mezzanine steel prior to the installation of the decking materials.  The contractor shall provide extra personnel during this phase to make the installation safe and efficient.  For the installation of the columns, girders and joists, a crew of four is anticipated.  Materials shall be hand carried into the room and positioned, although a small portable lift may be used at times to support the pieces while the installers make the final adjustments from 8 or 10' step ladders. The mezzanine deck surface shall ultimately cover an area that is 60' x 30' (drywall to drywall) with a 135" deck elevation.  The decking material shall be moisture resistant hardened particle board coated on the top with a gray acrylic slip resistant finish.  The decking material shall be 3/4" tongue and groove high density particle board applied over 1.5" x 20 gauge corrugated steel decking to create a hard smooth slip resistant floor surface for use with pallet movers.  The corrugated metal shall be painted white on the underside.

<CONTACT>Patrick Gallegos, Contracting Officer, Phone 559 297-0706 Ext. 4830, Fax 559-294-4833, Email pgallegos@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Project Schedule: The Forest Service expects to award the design contract in late April or early May of 2006, with design completion expected by December.  Construction will be solicited as a separate contract upon completion of the project design, and is not expected to begin until the site is accessible in late May or early June of 2007.    	
Project Location:  The Juniper mine is located at an elevation of 8,500 feet in the Stanislaus National Forest, Summit Ranger District, about 40 miles east of Sonora, California.  

Directions: HWY 108 east of Sonora to Forest Service road 5N01, approximately 35 miles, on the right, follow signs to Niagara OHV area.  Stay on 5N01 for approximately 12 miles to the turn off for Forest Service road 5N33, the entrance gate to the Site is a few hundred yards up 5N33, which is closed to the public.  The 5N33 turn off is between Sardine and Red Rock Meadows.  Haypress Meadow, and a cluster of summer cabins, is 1 -2 miles past the turn off.

Project Description:  A detailed description of the site and planned removal action can be found in the Engineering Evaluation/ Cost Analysis (EE/CA), which is available to perspective vendors on request.  The Juniper Uranium Mine Site (Site) is an abandoned open pit uranium mine.   After discovery of uranium in 1955, the mine produced an estimated 500 tons of ore from 1956 to 1966. Ore processing was not performed on site.  The main site features, including the open pit and three overburden and waste rock piles, encompass approximately 34 acres.  The estimated combined volume of the waste rock and overburden piles is approximately 50,000 cubic yards.  

As described in the EE/CA, the Forest Service plans to consolidate the waste piles and sediments from outwash areas around the site back into the open pit in an engineered Group A mine waste repository.  Because of a spring at the bottom of the pit and seeps emanating from the pit head wall, construction of an under drain (drain rock, perforated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping, drainage fabric, and sand layer) to prevent groundwater from flowing into the repository will be required.  Contaminated material is to be consolidated into the repository in a prescribed order, covered with a 30-mil flexible geomembrane liner, a sand drainage layer and a minimum of 3 feet of clean soil from waste pile #3.  Disturbed areas and the final cover material will be graded, blended in with natural contours and revegetated to minimize surface erosion.  Because of the partially saturated condition of waste pile # 2, which is the most significant source of waste to be place in the repository, a water treatment system will be required. The repository is expected to generate drainage that will require treatment for a brief period of time after construction.  The Forest Service expects to use an on site passive ion exchange to treat drain down from the repository.  Design specifications for treatment will be developed based on analytical results of drainage after construction is completed.  

Brief Hazard Description:   (Hazards/Environmental Impacts):  Elevated levels of uranium and gamma radiation have been detected in the area of the open pit and waste rock pile #2.  Levels of gamma radiation were highest in waste rock pile #2 (125 to 11,500 micro Rem per hour) and the mine pit (30 to 6,500 micro Rem per hour).  Uranium was detected above the 1,064 mg/kg recreational Preliminary Remediation Goal (PRG) on the surface of waste rock pile #2.  Sediments containing radio nuclides, including Uranium and it’s decay products continue to migrate offsite from the pit and waste pile #2 with spring runoff, frequent summer thunderstorms and windborne dust.   Red rock creek and the area immediately around the site are utilized by the public, wildlife and grazing cattle.  Sensitive areas immediately down gradient from the site include Red Rock and Sardine meadows. No Pre bid tour date will be scheduled.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a follow-on blanket purchase agreement to AeroTech Research (ATR), Incorporated of Newport News, Virginia for engineering and technical support services to support the finalization reporting of the turbulence portion of the Aviation Safety Program.  This is for the continued development of the turbulence research plan for "Radar Turbulence Hazard Metric Development" and "Operational Evaluation of a Prototype Turbulence Auto-PIREP System (TAPS)".  These services will be provided via a "task order" type arrangement.  Quantity:  One (1) Job. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase these services using the authority for other than full and open competition, which is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Justification is based upon ATR's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services involving the Aviation Safety Program.  In addition, ATR owns the proprietary information for this effort and patent numbers 6,650,972  "Estimation, transmission, receipt, and presentation of vehicle specific environmental conditions and hazards information and 6,917,860 "Transmission, receipt, and presentation of vehicle specific environmental conditions and hazards information".  Award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. See note 22. Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to BMG Labtech, Inc., 2415 Presidential Drive, Durham, NC 27703 for the acquisition of POLARstar OPTIMA System. The POLARstar OPTIMA system provides five measurement principles: (1) fluorescence polarization, (2) fluorescence, (3) time resolved fluorescence, (4) visible and low UV absorbance, (5) glow luminescence using plate sizes ranging from 6-384 wells. A unique feature of this instrument allows dual emission reading for  fluorescence intensity and luminescence. The POLARstar OPTIMA provides 8 multichromatic filters per wheel for total of sixteen filters and allows researchers to read dual emission specta. The POLARstar OPTIMA has two injectors, both injectors inject at the point of measurement, and can inject  before, during or after a read and can also inject simultaneously so that the stimulus and detection reagent are injected at the same time for more accurate measure of luminescence. The injectors will dispense between 5-350 ul, with variable volumes per wells using programmable timing. This  increases the range  of experimental design to include measurements of multiple endpoints on the same plate.  The EPA has identified BMG Labtech the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 13.106 (B) only one source  reasonably available. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ  will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research for patent application analysis tools for automating a wide range of common patent analysis tasks enabling users to analyze patent applications and extract meaningful information/intelligence. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT. This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Strong relationships with industry are a priority of the USPTO, and the USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this information request. 
Background
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) with its headquarters presently located in Alexandria, Virginia. The mission of the USPTO is the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks. The USPTO serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications. It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in matters involving intellectual property. 

Currently the USPTO databases house about 7 million patents and over 30 million documents comprising 19 terabytes of storage with 6,000 internal users and 1,500 concurrent public users. There is an ongoing need to examine patent applications, maintain patent quality, and perform patentability analysis.

ALL ANALYSIS TOOL VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS RFI.  USPTO is considering multiple analysis tools to aid examiners.

<DESC>Network Centric Warfare-Digital Battlefield Instrumentation (NCW-DBI) Solutions
Request for Information (RFI)

Closing Date:  19 April 2006

The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS); Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) in support of providing major instrumentation for the US Army Operational and Developmental Testing Communities to test and evaluate Future Force communications networks and Warfighting technologies, is seeking information from interested parties that have existing instrumentation that can be upgraded to support the multiple mission needs of testing at the system level and in a Force-on-Force Network Centric Warfare (NCW) environment.  It is the desire of PM ITTS to expand on the existing capabilities of the Army’s existing Improved Field Data Collector (IFDC) V4 system as the foundation for this initiative. Responders must have experience with the IFDC V4 and have the means to grow and expand its current capabilities to support the future mission objectives addressed herein.  If alternate considerations are submitted, the instrumentation and capability would, at some level, have supported US Army testing missions, have been designed and tested to insure required performance in the tactical and training operational environment, be able to interface directly with multiple tactical radios and LANs to provide ground truth of the tactical communications networks, interface to the Weapon systems’ data bus to monitor and record messages as well as provide some level of message injection, provide Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) by interfacing to existing RTCA systems and performing stand-alone internal Force-on-Force adjudication for both direct and indirect fire events, and provide a direct injection jamming capability to simulate threat emitters.  The desired system would provide correlated data based on each instrumented component and be able to support secure communications and provide tamper proof housings at each instrumentation node.

Capabilities:

Specific capabilities for each of the four integrated Network Centric Warfare – Digital Battlefield Instrumentation (NCW-DBI) capabilities sought include:
 
1.  Tactical Communications Analysis is needed at each node in the battlefield (weapon systems and dismounted soldiers) to provide ground truth of both tactical network, LAN communication and individual point to point communications.  Specific element capabilities desired include, but are not limited to: Data collection platforms such as JTRS Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Man pack, small form fit variants (soldiers, UAV/UGV), IFDCv4 enhancement/upgrades (secure, tamper-proof), smaller, more powerful, higher speed data collection (Gig-E LAN, USB 2.0), emerging physical interfaces and data formats (USB, Firewire, IPv6, XML, sensor data, and JVMF), and Current Force Systems (JNN, Win-T, VoIP), including the Wideband Network Waveform (WNW) and JTRS Cluster 1.
  
2.  Weapon Systems Data Bus interface and message filtering capability is desired to capture and process digital message traffic on various weapon system data busses.  The interface should be capable of selecting specific messages of interest, and be reprogrammable to support various data bus implementations and message content.  The interface should be able to provide critical data elements to other portions of the NCW-DBI system to support aggregated and correlated performance assessments.  The capability should exist to have access to system information based on crew actions and performance right off the system.

3.	The threat jamming simulation component of NCW-DBI is desired to have both a direct injection jamming simulation capability and a software simulated jamming capability.  The direct injection component must be threat accredited to replicate expected RF wave forms directly into the tactical communications systems to preclude the need for over the air jamming.  It is highly desired that the direct injection jamming component of NCW-DBI provide multiple simultaneous threat waveforms, be able to monitor and control jamming assets thru Starship, and have interfaces to support smaller, more mobile Electronic Warfare (EW) instrumentation. 

4.  Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) capability is required to provide direct and indirect Force-on-Force engagement simulation.  The RTCA architecture must be expandable in terms of both software modeling and hardware interfacing to support future growth.  The RTCA component of NCW-DBI should be capable of interfacing to existing MILES and MAIS Family of Devices and be expandable to interface to new laser based paring devices and geo-paring devices and software models.

<DESC>Real-time Acoustic Imaging Microscope for Micro-Device Research and  
Manufacturing Optimization

Description

The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a method for directly  
imaging acoustic waves on a surface. In particular, the Laser  
Ultrasonic Microscope allows  rapid full field real-time imaging of the  
vibration of  micron sized regions and devices.  The high speed  
visualization results in research and performance optimization in  
manufacturing of consumer micro-devices, which has direct application  
in the telecommunications industry, medical industry, surveillance  
industry, and wherever the evaluation of vibration patterns are needed.  
  
Several prototypes have been developed capable of imaging vibrations,  
in the Hz to GHz range, of objects ranging in size from microns to  
meters.  One prototype ultrasonic microscope is proving to be  
invaluable in quality control monitoring and development of MEMS  
devices produced by a fortune 500 company.  For example, the device has  
been used to improve film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) technology, by  
clearly showing three dimensional vibration patterns of the devices:

See also:  http://www.inl.gov/physics/nlo/ultrasoniccamerarefs.shtml

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms  
interested in commercialization of this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be  
carried out by license of this technology to a company.  Additional  
development and support may be possible through Cooperative Research  
and Development Agreements with some or all of the funding support  
being provided by the participant(s).  The INL has several patents on  
the process.  See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,827,971, 6,134,006, 6,175,411,  
6,401,540, 6,486,962, and 6,836,336.  See also published U.S. Patent  
Application Nos. 10/267,320, 10/267,237.  These patents may be licensed  
exclusively or nonexclusively.  The INL invites interested parties to  
contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this  
technology into an operation.  For questions regarding this technology,  
licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy:

<CONTACT>CHERYL FLANAGAN  CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369323     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has entered into an agreement with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support FEMA disaster response efforts in every state (including Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. possessions) by procuring, under emergency conditions, remotely sensed imagery/data where acquisition timeliness, processing turnaround time, and product quality are critical. To accomplish this role, the USGS is compiling a database of interested and qualified vendors from which to contact and place orders for a range of imagery products, data, or services that is limited to that which can be acquired/remotely sensed by aircraft. This would include the collection of digital optical photography or digital multispectral imaging, with simultaneous lidar data collects. The entire area of interest will be acquired in the 1-2 days immediately following the event and the processing of both the multispectral and lidar data will be completed within three hours of acquisition. The processed data will include natural color and false color orthorectified imagery, digital elevation model products, and appropriate metadata. The processed data will be delivered to FEMA and USGS EROS by electronic delivery immediately upon completion of processing and QA in compressed jpeg and uncompressed geotiff formats in pre-defined tiles. The database will be composed primarily from written responses received for this Request for Information. Therefore, the USGS requests that interested vendors provide a written response (not to exceed three pages) that addresses the following items: 1) Vendor information. Vendor name; whether the vendor is small or large business; home office and satellite office addresses and phone numbers; electronic mail and/or world wide web addresses; FAX number; a contact person, and a person to contact outside of normal business hours and on weekends; 2) Equipment and capabilities. A brief description of available equipment/capabilities, to include at a minimum, but not restricted to, the following: (a) type and quantity of aircraft that the vendor can make available for data acquisition; (b) type and quantity of digital sensors, including type/model/spectral characteristics and whether they have been calibrated; (c) description of airborne GPS capabilities;(d) characteristics of digital imagery and data that the vendor can provide, such as resolution, spectral bands and ranges, othrorectification, and digital elevation model; (3) Response range. This is a description of the geographic extent (area) for which the vendor is willing to acquire requested imagery/data. This can be expressed in different ways, such as by naming States, or by a specified mile radius around a city. Also indicate if  you can provide services to any of the U.S. possessions, such as Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, etc. Any imagery or data the USGS procures in response to a natural disaster event will be held and distributed in the public domain. Do not respond or include information on proprietary products and/or services which preclude public distribution of the data. Although not requested, prospective vendors may provide commercial pricing information (such as flight line rate) as part of the response in as much detail as the vendor is willing to provide. Written responses should be mailed, faxed, or preferably electronically mailed within thirty (30) days from publication of this request to: U.S. Geological Survey, Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science, ATTN: Mike Crane, 47914 252nd Street, Sioux Falls, SD  57198-0001; FAX (605) 594-6529; email mpcrane@usgs.gov. The receipt of a written response will be considered an acceptance on the part of the vendor to provide (if contacted) the necessary products or services. No formal solicitation or contract will result from this Request for Information.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 
Project Title: SAMHSA National Spending Estimates Project for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment: # 270-06-0149 

Project Description:  CSAT /CMHS will continue to provide highly technical work in producing 10 year estimates of all national past expenditures, 10 year projections on future spending, and special cost and utilization reports--addressing all expenditures on public and private mental health services and substance abuse treatment (MH/SA). The methodology used to develop the estimates and projections will be parallel to those used previously under the Spending Estimates Project (i.e., National Expenditures on Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Treatment, 1991 – 2001, DHHS Pub No. SMA-05-3999) and is produced to be comparable to the overall national expenditures that are produced by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  The SAMHSA spending estimates will also capture and segregate detailed additional MH/SA expenditures and MH/SA providers not included in the CMS National Health Accounts. 

The Spending Estimates Project requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge. The technical capabilities include: actuarial research and estimation, econometric techniques, projections and forecasting methods, ability to input missing information, understanding of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases (both surveys and claims), detailed actuarial knowledge with the national health accounts, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, and sound judgment about data quality and usefulness. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to improve the spending estimates and the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences. In addition to these technical capabilities, national MH/SA policy expertise is necessary. Such knowledge must encompass a detailed understanding of mental health and substance abuse treatment services, spending, and financing; knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse (MHSA); as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing. 

To carry out this project the contractor shall accomplish the following: 

A)	Propose and implement a methodology for making 10 year spending estimates and for making 10 year projections that provide for continuity and consistency with previous sets of MH/SA estimates disseminated by SAMHSA. Each year, evaluate produced reports/articles and make recommendations prior to the next round of estimates or projections for improvements in the methodology that has been previously developed. Review of pertinent literature in methods, cost reporting and new or changed national databases is included. 

B)	Develop estimates for at least a ten-year period of national MH/SA spending that parallel the previous sets of MH/SA estimates undertaken by SAMHSA and are consistent with estimates of general health care spending produced by the CMS. This includes utilization of the same categories of payment and service type that are employed in the general CMS Health Accounts estimates. In addition, estimates for these categories should be further disaggregated by the type of MH/SA service and diagnosis (i.e., MH/SA, MH, SA, Alcohol and Drug Treatment). 

C)	Develop projections of future MH/SA spending across a 10 year period.  Forecasting methods available should be assessed for usefulness and blended methods used, if this would provide the best projections.  As the total time period of past estimates lengthens, increasingly sophisticated methods should be possible.

D)	Prepare a variety of special reports integrating financing policy concerns of the current mental health and substance abuse treatment literature and trends, highlighting policy relevant findings.  These special reports will explore cost, service utilization, special populations or other trends to further refine the spending estimates and to explore the factors that affect the trends in spending.
Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due on February 9, 2006. The anticipated period of performance is a one year with four 1 year option periods. After review of the responses received a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities around February 28, 2006.

<CONTACT>Steven Bobby, 202.493-4786
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSEMENT National Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of  Office Supplies & Equipment (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii & Territories) This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.   This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time.  Background: The FAA at its nine Regional Offices, two Centers, as well as at headquarters and at other locations, employs a variety of purchasing processes to acquire equipment, services and supplies used in the furtherance of agency missions and goals. Purchasing processes are defined as the purchase of supplies and services through various means, including purchase cards, interagency agreements, GSA schedules, as well as through direct single source and competitive procurements.   These purchasing processes are generally not closely coordinated across purchasing domains within the agency.  The FAA's Chief Financial Officer has determined that coordination and restructuring of these purchasing processes will lead to reduced costs and increased efficiencies.  One of the major objectives in the FAA Flight Plan is to control costs while delivering quality customer service.  To help achieve the Flight Plan of controlling costs, the FAA has embarked on an important agency-wide strategic sourcing initiative.  This initiative is called Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program. The Program will include all FAA Lines of Business, Staff Offices, Regions, and Centers.     The objective of the SAVES Program is to enable the FAA to purchase selected commodities for less.  With the support of the FAA's Chief Financial Officer, usage of these vehicles will be strongly encouraged agency wide and monitored for compliance so we may realize savings and control costs. All awards will be based on a best value analysis. We will be releasing a Screening Information Request. (SIR) in the next couple weeks for the "Office Supplies" commodity.   In addition we plan on utilizing the latest electronic processes for online offers & proposal receipt for the commodity SIR as appropriate.  We may ask for Best and Final Offers and we are considering the use of on-line reverse auctioning to obtain the best pricing. We welcome your comments.     Capability: It is the FAA's intent to contract with a commercial office supply company which is both an authorized distributor of Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) products and is on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 75. The draft statement of work (SOW) for the Office Supplies Commodity is attached. The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the procurement (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract), which will be 5 years, including the base period of one year, and four option periods of one year each.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is (453210) Office Supplies and Stationery Stores. We request that you review the draft statement of work and provide your comments.  In addition, we request that you address any/all of the items below: Capability Statement - Please answer the following questions and reply back via email:   1) Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 75, SIN 75 200? 2) Is your firm an authorized Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) distributor? 3) Does your firm sell a full range of "core" office supplies as defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 4) Does your firm sell a full range of "non-core" office supplies as defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain.  5) -Does your firm currently have a contract with another agency of the Federal Government?  If yes, please provide additional information.  6) Is your firm capable of meeting the delivery time frames to the locations listed in the SOW? 7) Does your firm distribute full range of JWOD products?  If no, please explain.  8) Is your firm capable of providing an internet based web portal for use by only the FAA?  9) Is your firm capable of substituting JWOD products that are essentially the same as commercial products?  If yes, please explain. 10) Is your firm capable of providing products that conform to the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines?  If yes, please explain. 11)  Is your firm capable of providing energy producing products qualified through the Electronics Products Environmental Assessment Tool?  If yes, please explain. 12) Are you a large or small Business?  13) After reviewing the SOW will you consider submitting a proposal? Why not. 14) Are any of the SOW Section C requirements unreasonably restrictive? Explain? 15)  Would you consider a teaming arrangement to meet the requirements?  16) Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW to assist the FAA in achieving the highest overall cost savings and best value (i.e. longer delivery timeframes, pricing methods, etc.), efficiency (web portal, reporting, etc.), and/or compliance with federal mandatory purchasing requirements (JWOD, CPG, Energy Policy Act of 2005, etc.). Should you decline to submit a response to this survey your firm will still be eligible to respond to the "Office Supplies"  SIR in the future.    Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: which is the "Contract Opportunities" site. http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this request.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational request only.  No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.

1.0	PART I: BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1	Overview
The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seeks information related to the IT Infrastructure Optimization Initiative (IOI). The objective is to further refine the opportunities for IT infrastructure consolidation and optimization, and develop government-wide common solutions. The IOI will define specific common performance measures for service levels and costs, identify best practices, and develop guidance for transition plans within agencies and/or across agencies. 
Consolidation and optimization of IT infrastructure represents a significant opportunity to realize future cost savings by taking a more coordinated approach to spending on commodity IT infrastructure. IT infrastructure consolidation and optimization case studies also demonstrate that agencies could improve IT service levels and, when relieved of the burden of managing these non-core functions, concentrate more on mission priorities and results.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The IT Infrastructure Optimization Task Force intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services. 
1.2	Purpose
The purpose of this RFI is to provide industry, government (federal, state & local, and tribal), and non-profit organizations with a vehicle to describe solutions and implementation approaches for achieving the government’s IOI vision and goals through the development of common solutions integrated with the Federal Enterprise Architecture. This will enable the government to incorporate strategies, alternatives, experiences and innovative practices in developing and implementing common solutions. The ultimate goal is to achieve an optimized federal IT infrastructure to better serve the citizen. This requirement builds upon the existing E Government framework and facilitates a federal enterprise-wide effort. 
Responses to this RFI should be from the perspective of being an IT infrastructure user, provider or consultant at the enterprise level. The government does not need at this time, information marketing a firm’s products for use in a common solution. The RFI is to: 
•	Solicit information from industry, government, and non-profit organizations on strategies, alternatives, and experiences in developing and implementing programs and innovative practices that have been effective in increasing IT infrastructure effectiveness and efficiency;
•	Solicit lessons learned from enterprises that have overcome similar challenges as those faced by the government (e.g., large geographically dispersed work force, decentralization, multi-platform environments, legacy systems, and limited resources); and
•	As necessary and appropriate, support development of joint business cases to implement any common solutions and to inform agencies’ FY 2008 budget requests and OMB’s decisions.
1.3	Scope
This RFI is soliciting information supporting improvements in the federal government-wide IT Infrastructure Optimization Initiative. The Managing Partners for this initiative are the:

1.4	Guiding Principles
OMB and the established Task Force are focused on business-driven, common solutions integrated with the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The definitions of these key characteristics include:
•	Common Solutions – Service solutions needed to meet operational requirements through a target architecture that includes common business processes and services
•	Concept of Operations – The Infrastructure Optimization Initiative and common solutions will be organized, governed, and measured through a defined CONOPS
•	Federal Enterprise Architecture – Common solutions will be integrated within layers of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (ref http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/a-1-fea.html )
•	Business Driven vs. Technology Driven – Solutions address distinct business improvements that directly impact IT infrastructure performance goals
1.5	Vision, Goals, Objectives
The Federal Government’s vision for the Infrastructure Optimization Initiative is:
An effective and efficient IT infrastructure enabling government-wide customer-centric services
The goals and objectives supporting this vision are:
Goal 1: Infrastructure enables interoperability of functions across agencies and programs.
•	Objective 1.1: Single-faced/one-stop services.

•	Objective 4.5: Provide scalable capabilities to meet needs of different size organizations.
1.6	Areas Included Within IT Infrastructure Optimization Initiative
The Task Force has identified five areas it believes are important for IT Infrastructure Optimization. 
•	DATA CENTER – A data center is any facility (room or building) used for equipment for the storage, management, and dissemination of electronic data and information to multiple users. Examples of costs included in “data center” are building/facilities costs (lease, purchase, utility costs, property management), building/office assets (desks, chairs, office supplies, server racks), data center staff (in-house and contractor), hosting and storage servers (all levels including mainframe to file server, as well as storage management/provision devices such as silos, SANS, data center class printers, etc), and software (licenses) running on hosting and storage servers (including licenses for mission-oriented/enterprise apps and application development components).
•	TELECOMMUNICATIONS (VOICE NETWORKS) – Telecommunications (telecom) refers to communication over long distances and typically covers all forms of distance and/or conversion of the original communications, including radio, telegraphy, television, telephony, data communication, and computer networking. Examples of costs included in “telecom” are land line service, cellular service, telephones/wireless devices, and VOIP appliances, servers, handsets, and software added to a data network to allow voice communications.
•	DATA NETWORKS – Data networks refers to the hardware, software, and communication services that allow any two computers or other devices to exchange data between them. Examples of costs included in “data network” are communication lines/bandwidth, routers, switches, firewalls, intrusion detection and other security infrastructure, lease/purchase/operation of devices to transport data electronically and all devices, staff, and software to manage the same. 
•	DESKTOP/SEAT MANAGEMENT – Desktop/seat management typically refers to the acquisition, deployment, and ongoing support of the technology associated with the desktop computing environment. Examples of costs included in “desktop/seat management” are workstations, desktop/local network printers/scanners, office automation software (e.g. Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Project, etc.), and desktop management/support staff and service contracts (e.g. outsourcing contracts). This does not include help desk or network costs that are defined separately in this section.
•	IT HELP DESK – A help desk is an information and assistance resource that troubleshoots problems with computers and other information technology products. Examples of costs included in “help desk” are staff, help desk support contracts (outsourcing), and incident (ticket) tracking software. 
We understand that RFI respondents may identify additional areas they believe to be critical in an effective federal IT infrastructure. Therefore, Part II, Section 8 has been created for respondents to provide information regarding any additional area identified.
1.7	Instructions for Responding to the RFI Questionnaire (Part II)
The RFI Questionnaire (Part II) is divided into the following sections.
•	Section 1 - requests information about your organization. You MUST respond to this section.
•	Section 2 - addresses the overall Infrastructure Optimization Initiative without regard to individual infrastructure areas. You MAY choose to respond to this section.
•	Sections 3 to 7 - addresses the infrastructure areas identified in Part I-6. You MAY respond to the sections for any, or all, of the infrastructure areas. There is a common set of questions that should be answered for each of the infrastructure areas to which you are responding. In addition, there are a small number of specific questions for each infrastructure area. 
•	Section 8 - MAY be used to address any additional infrastructure area you believe the IOI should include, beyond the five areas already identified in Part I-6.
Please respond to the appropriate sections based on your experience with infrastructure service optimization for complex, disparate organizations or component subdivisions. We are interested in both your actual experience and your recommendations about what would work best to achieve the goals of the Federal government-wide Infrastructure Optimization Initiative. 
For purposes of this RFI, the term “optimization” means implementation of common solutions to improve effectiveness and reduce the cost of IT services. Common solutions can vary widely but include consolidation, shared services, establishment of centers of excellence, standardization and aggregate buys.
Part II presents the questions asked by this RFI. To assist the government Task Force in analysis of the submissions, this section has been pre-formatted with tagged fields.

Please respond to the appropriate Sections based on your experience coordinating the use of geographic information or optimizing related spatial data activities.
The Government recognizes that respondents may have information pertaining to only some geospatial areas. Limited, “best of breed”, information can still be of high quality and significant value to the ultimate common solution(s) for the Geospatial LoB. Therefore, while the government seeks to define common solutions that address the full spectrum of geospatial activities, it does not discourage partial responses. If you choose not to respond to a question, indicate “no response” and identify the rationale.
We are interested in both your actual experience and your recommendations about what would work best to achieve the goals and objectives of the Geospatial LoB.
For purposes of this RFI, the term “optimization” means implementation of common solutions to improve effectiveness and efficiencies in order to improve services to citizens and reduce the cost of government. Common solutions can vary widely but may include consolidation, shared services, establishment of centers of excellence, standardization, aggregate buys, or similar activities.
Respondents must factor key public values as defined by the NSDI  into each response whenever applicable. Key public values include:
•	Privacy and security of citizens’ personal data and accuracy of statistical information on people, both in raw form and in derived information products
•	Access for all citizens to spatial data, information, and interpretive products, in accordance with OMB Circular A-130
•	Protection of proprietary interests related to licensed information and data
•	Interoperability of Federal information systems to enable the drawing of resources from multiple Federal agencies and their partners 
Part II presents the questions asked by this RFI. To assist the government Task Force in analysis of the submissions, this section has been pre-formatted with tagged fields and attached as a file to the RFI. Please download this section as a template, and use the template to respond to each question.

(1) Institutional experience in management of large multi-site research and/or program evaluation studies of Head Start and/or comprehensive pre-kindergarten or social services programs for low-income children; (2) Demonstrated experience and capability to conduct large-scale data collection within tight time frames involving parent and teacher interviews, and direct assessments of school-aged children’s cognitive, social and physical functioning, including assessments with children from a wide range of ethnic, cultural and linguistic populations; (3) Institutional capability and expertise in state-of-the-art statistical methodology, including psychometric analysis, growth curve analysis and hierarchical modeling, as well as expertise with statistical and methodological issues inherent in large, nationally representative, randomized control trials; (4) Experience in efficiently managing the range of tasks related to the training and management of field staff located in all regions of the U.S., and the data collection and quality control activities associated with multi-site studies of similar programs; and (5) Adequate computer/statistical resources and the institutional capability to process and analyze a large volume of assessment and interview data, including capacity to input data, clean data and conduct quality control checks.

Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to KMcGowan@psc.gov by no later than 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time, on May 5, 2006.

<SUBJECT>R -- Partnership for a Drug Free America
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with the Partnership for a Drug Free America (PDFA) for the acquisition of the development of a special analytic report concerning the Partnership for a Drug-Free America’s Attitude Tracking Study (PATS) of teens in grades six (6) through twelve (12).  The Government intends to award a contract for a base plus four options. 

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in conjunction with the Partnership for a Drug Free America has a Congressional Mandate to operate the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.

ONDCP is seeking a special analytic report concerning the 2002 through 2006 Partnership for a Drug Free America’s Attitude Tracking Study (PATS) of teens in grades 6 through 12. This study is conducted by Roper Public Affairs & Media on behalf of PDFA and is the only survey currently being conducted with questions that specifically pertain to the Media Campaign. This special analysis shall be completed prior to the completion of the formal PATS study report.

Therefore, a sole source to PDFA is intended for this task, as this is merely a special analytic report of the data collected by Roper Public Affairs & Media on behalf of PDFA. It is necessary to have Roper, through PDFA, perform the special analysis and present their findings in a formal report. No other sources have access to the data and no other dataset exists that includes questions on the issues that are of paramount importance to the ONDCP.

No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 15 days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to the Partnership for a Drug Free America (PDFA).

Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to Gina Hanna at ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov.   Or, responses may be addressed to Gina Hanna, Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street, UNB 4th Floor, Parkersburg, WV  26101. E-mail responses requiring more than 5 megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Nanolaminate Deformable Mirrors for Adaptive Optics
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Nanolaminate Deformable Mirrors for Adaptive Optics

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license nanolaminate deformable mirror technology for applications like adaptive optics and laser beam stablization. 

Background: Nanolaminate deformable mirrors have been developed for adaptive optical correction of both large terrestrial telescopes and lightweight space optics.  Although the technology was invented to improve the performance of large terrestrial and space-based telescopes, the continuous high surface quality mirrors and dense actuation make this technology applicable to other optical correction applications such as high-power lasers. 

Description:  This technology combines high-spatial-density electrostatic actuators and thin, flexible, lightweight nanolaminate mirrors.  There are two similar deformable mirrors that cover a wide range of size scales:  (1) a high-actuator-density device that uses silicon MEMS actuators and (2) a large-scale, low-density device that uses electrostatic actuators formed with the nanolaminate foil itself together with electroplated posts and ridges.

Advantages:  The combination of electrostatic actuation and nanolaminate mirrors provide much greater actuator density than has previously been available for continuous deformable mirrors, and a much higher quality mirror than has previously been available with high-density MEMS deformable mirrors.
•	Very Scalable &#61664; fits a large variety of applications	
•	More robust for tough handling & bonding &#61664; higher reliability
•	Flexible enough to be deformed by weak actuators &#61664; lower operating costs
•	High quality mirror surface &#61664; higher reflectance &#61664; higher productivity
•	Continuous mirror surface &#61664; necessary for high-power lasers
•	High actuator density &#61664; greater control of mirror surface shape

Potential Applications:  
•	Astronomical instruments
•	High-power lasers
•	Vision science

Development Status:  Preliminary prototypes have been made.  Need to develop more samples to be used and tested in commercial applications. For diagrams and additional information on electrostatic actuation of MEMS and MEMS-like structures go to:
http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/Nanolaminate_Deformable_Mirrors.php

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  
Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Nanolaminate Deformable Mirrors should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>A -- 12-Month Extension to the Airborne Infrared Surveillance Contract
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency has a requirement for a one-year extension of the Airborne Infrared Surveillance (AIRS) effort under Contract HQ0006-02-C-0044.  The extension is to perform limited RDT&E in FY07 and closeout the program.  With this one-year extension, this contract will end not later than 30 September 2007.  The limited RDT&E effort continues to exploit the use of an electro-optic/infrared sensor designed, developed and integrated into the host aircraft by the incumbent contractor, L-3 Communications /Aeromet Division.  The sensor is hosted on a Gulfstream II aircraft operated by L-3 Communications /Aeromet and is used as a test asset for data collection by the MDA.  The aircraft/sensor combination is called the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) II.  The key technical capabilities requiring further demonstration and evaluation during the final period of performance are:  1) cued and autonomous search, detection, and acquisition; 2) real-time missile tracking and 3-D state vector generation; 3) real-time discrimination of object(s) of interest; 4) real-time connectivity with MDAs Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications system; and 5) data reduction as a result of contract closeout.

The effort will continue to include data collection, analyses and potential modification of the sensor suite mounted on the HALO II aircraft.  The HALO II sensor suite will be used to collect infrared surveillance data against targets of interest to the MDA.  This data will be processed in real time on board the HALO II to form state vectors and object sighting messages to be downlinked to the MDA C2BMC system as fire control solutions.  The required effort consists of detailed test planning, engineering evaluations, minor modifications, and experiments and demonstrations for the HALO II aircraft and its support equipment.  

MDA intends to award a contract extension to L-3 Communications /Aeromet for this one-year effort.  MDA intends that this contract extension will be cost-plus-fixed-fee, the same contract type as the current, on-going contract.  This contract extension will be awarded to L-3 Communications /Aeromet pursuant to FAR 6.302-1-(a) (iii): only one responsible source.  It is improbable that a new competition for a one-year extension could be executed without causing an adverse impact in the remaining AIRS effort.   A contract extension to the incumbent Contractor is the only solution to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 14-3K47-06 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08.   The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Solexa, Inc. Hayward, CA pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.   Inside delivery is required to FOB destination to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland, 20705-2350, within 18 months of award.  This solicitation is unrestricted.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services have been located that are capable of  satisfying  agency requirements.  BFGL and immediate collaborators located at USDA, Roman L. Hruska Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Clay Center NE and The Fort Keough Livestock & Range Research Laboratory in Mile City, MT have a requirement to purchase services to catalog the full repertoires of genes expressed in the Bovine Transcriptome and ultimately seed the creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas.  This multi-institute initiative is supported by the USDA CSREES NRI award to grant proposal 2005-05011, which states the following objective “Establish a high-quality bovine Gene Atlas that will have extensive utility for all studies in ruminant physiology, genetics and genomics including genome annotation.  The expression data that will create the initial foundation of the gene atlas will be generated using transcript profiles generated from the 100 tissues collected from the “genome sequence” cow and her offspring. The minimum requirements for this service include the capability and knowledge required to perform a custom gene expression service that maps the transcriptome content of cattle by a process that captures, simultaneously, all the cDNA “signatures” in a sample from a complex mixture of cDNA molecules derived from total RNA.  This process must deliver a count of all cDNA (from mRNA) in a sample, even those in low/rare abundance or genes that have yet to be discovered.  Base quality scores must be provided for all the sequences.  Precision and sensitivity of the methodology must be in the dynamic range of quantitative detection from less than one transcript per cell to 100,000 copies per cell.  At a minimum, 1,000,000 “signature” sequence tags must be generated from each of the 100 samples of total bovine RNA.  An overall total of 100 million signature sequences with a minimum length of 20 bp must be produced from all the different bovine RNA isolates.  Because of the rarity of some of the tissues samples, only 5 ug of total RNA will be supplied by the government for some samples. The service must include a partial bioinformatic analyses of the sequence information to help creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas (tag counts and identities).  All steps to produce these sequence tags must be assured by the quality control processes.  Samples must be tracked from project start to finish on a sample basis.  Data must be held in a secure database until accessed by secure FTP.  This includes virus protection, e-mail encryption, multiple firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure VPN technology, fingerprint scanners, and multiple tape storage systems to manage data security.  Sequencing of 100 million sequence tags must be concluded within 18 months.  All residual materials will be returned to our laboratories.
This requirement is exempt from the Service Contract Act. This solicitation incorporates the following FAR clauses, provisions and addendums: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items; 52.217-5; In paragraph (b) of 52.212-5 the following apply: 52.203-6, 52.219-8, 52.219-14, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-41, 52.222-42, 52.222-43, 52.225-1, 52.225-13, and 52.232-34; 52.232-18 Availability of Funds ;COMPLIANCE WITH VETERANS EMPLOYMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (JAN 1999) (DEVIATION)(USDA).

Typical transportation of propane to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  The full “pickle” barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the 125 Gal. “Pickle” barrels to standard 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  Offeror must have experience with this type of task due to high risks associated with it.
Fuel Requirement:  Contractor shall fuel all remote sites with propane quantities per schedule in Attachment 1. All sites are to be filled to maximum capacity, given altitude and temperature limitations for each site.

Contractor shall be prepared to account for this variation by carrying 5 % more fuel than requirement calls for to handle this contingency.  Vendor shall record actual gallons of propane delivered to each site on the invoice and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
Provide four (4) Heitronics Infrared Radiation Pyrometer, Model KT19.85II or equivalent, 9.6-11.5 um, 2.5 FOV w/VS921 vacuum – tight germanium lens, RS-232 interface, four (4) analog outputs, -100 to 50C temperature range, response time : 5msec to 10 minute programmable, accuracy: +/- 0.4 C @ -20C (1 second response time).

Provide four (4) Heitronics Infrared Radiation Pyrometer, Model KT19.99 or equivalent, 14-16 um, 2.5 FOV w/ VS921 vacuum – tight germanium lens, RS-232 interface, four (4) analog outputs, -100 to 50 C temperature range, response time:  5msec to 10 minute programmable, accuracy: +/- 0.4 C @ -20C (1 second response time).

NOAA Aircraft Operations Center operates two P-3 aircraft in support of atmospheric research.  Each aircraft measures and records a variety of atmospheric parameters including sea surface temperature (SST) and CO2 temperature.  AOC currently uses Barnes/Pyrometer Instrument pyrometric sensors with custom control units designed and built at AOC.  The sensors have provided accurate temperature measurement over the years but have reached the end of their service life.  Barnes/Pyrometer Instrument has not done significant improvements to their sensor/control unit in many years.  Replacement sensors and control electronics are expensive and are large heavy components that do not utilize many of the advances that have taken place in infrared radiometer measurements and smart sensor technology over the years.  A cost effective, modern compact replacement sensor that meets or exceeds current accuracy and performance capability is needed.     

Measurement of SST and CO2 temperature from the NOAA P-3 aircraft is done using infrared radiation detectors.  To keep size and complexity to a minimum, non cooled detectors are preferred.  Pyroelectric sensors provide the best detectivity, response time, reliability and stability of the non cooled infrared detectors available.  Pyrometric detectors do no respond to absolute radiation intensities but to changes in radiation.  Mechanical choppers that mirrored surfaces are used to periodically interrupt the incident radiation from the target to the detector.  During each interruption the detector is exposed to a reference source inside the radiometer.  The chopped radiation method minimizes/eliminates temperature drift, reduces signal noise, and provides excellent dependability, accuracy, response time.

The replacement instruments must utilize an uncooled pyroelectric sensor with a chopped radiation method of detection.  A spectral response of 9.6 to 11.5 microns for SST radiometers and 14 to 16 microns for CO2 temperature radiometers is required.  Lens assemblies must be vacuum-tight Germanium lenses with a 2.5 degree field of vies (FOV).  Standard temperature range for the instruments must span -75 to 50 C.  Options must include selectable response time, multiple programmable analog output signals, RS-232 serial interface, and adjustable emissivity/reflectivity (see specifications below). 

The Heitronics Infrared Radiation Pyrometers, Model KT19.85-II (SST) and Model KT19.99 (CO2), meets the above requirements for accurately measuring sea surface and CO2 temperatures from the NOAA P-3 Research Aircraft.

(Oct 2003) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR and ORCA databases.  (1) The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page, the annotation DUNS# followed by the DUNS#. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Contractor is registered in the CCR and ORCA database. FAR 52.212-3   Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items (MAR 2005) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<SOLNBR>GS-03P-06-DX-C-0036
<RESPDATE>050806
<ARCHDATE>05232006
<CONTACT>Noel Willette, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-446-4520, Fax 215-446-6123, Email noel.willette@gsa.gov
<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Window Sill Replacement at the Norfolk Federal Building.   It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through a small business set-aside, utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures.  The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interests of the Government.  The NAICS for this procurement is code 238350.The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.

The work includes but is not limited to the removal of both the interior and exterior trim pieces along with the windows and frames in order to install a sill pan.  As part of the contract requirements the contractor shall take digital photos of the entire window sill after window removal and prior to re-installing the windows.  These photos will be used to document the conditions and be used by the inspection agent to insure compliance with the installation details and for quality assurance.  The attached elevations represent the building views and identify pan sills that are to be replaced.  The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining a weather barrier as windows are removed and replaced.  Any windows that will remain out overnight shall have the openings temporary secured using plywood (or suitable substitute) with a weather barrier.  Upon reinstalling of windows they shall be immediately cleaned inside and out using approved cleaning products.  

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly 
received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, “Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process”. As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; 1.) Firm lists a minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past ten (10) years of a similar scope of work that have a total construction value of at least $500,000.00. Two of the three projects must have been completed in an occupied building.  2) Superintendent shall submit resume demonstrating that he/she has 10 years of experience as a superintendent.  Since the Contracting Officer has elected to utilize past performance as an evaluation factor the procedures detailed in FAR 15.305, “Proposal evaluation”, shall be followed. All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability but shall not be ranked using non-cost/ price factors.

The RFP is scheduled to be available on or about April 7, 2006. The subject solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified Building Information (SBU).  For reasons of security and before release of SBU information, the requestor must complete and sign a "Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors".  IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A DOCUMENT SECURITY FORM PLEASE EMAIL noel.willette@gsa.gov.  All prime contractors interested in submitting a proposal shall submit via facsimile or e-mail a completed document security form.    As indicated, the form shall be filled out with the proper information including a photocopy of a valid business license, DUNS number, and IRS tax ID number. This information shall be emailed back to Melinda M. Richardson at melinda.richardson@gsa.gov.  

Once the soliciation is available and the Security Form Once is received and verified, direction will be provided as to where the RFP, including plans and specifications, will be available. A Pre-proposal conference will be established in the near future.  Time, date and location will be provided in the solicitation.

Reference RFQ N00189-06-T-0170 on your proposal. [FSC=3510 ].   NAICS 811310 ($12.5M).
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will be conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2005), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-3.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.
3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.
 (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The government will be responsible shipping the Main Landing Gear and required parts to the vendor facility. The vendor will be required to ship the removed Landing Gear and parts to a facility chosen by NOAA AOC at the time of de-installation. 

OVER AND ABOVE DISCREPANCIES

If any additional discrepancies outside of normal repair criteria are discovered during performance of the work, the selected discrepancies, will be provided in a written report to include any parts required, labor required, and cost estimate for the additional work.  This work will be considered as “over-and-above” costs.  The selected contractor will not proceed with the additional work until approval for the additional work is received from the Government Point of Contact.  The selected contractor shall accomplish all the work in accordance with the manufacturer’s repair/overhaul manuals and applicable repair station procedures.    

Labor, Parts, Discounts, and Warranties

The selected contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables.  However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, at anytime during the contract, if advantageous.  The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the assemblies.  Parts or components in an “as removed” condition will not be installed in the assemblies.  Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an “over-and-above.”  Since the Government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet these criteria, bidding maintenance contractors shall provide, in writing, the labor rate they will charge the Government, per hour for “over-and-above” discrepancies.  Secondly, bidding contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given.  

Period of Performance

Due to mission requirements and the limited number of spares possessed by the AOC the selected contractor is required to complete all work within 60 calendar days after receipt of the aircraft at the contractor’s facility.  Should abnormal requirements and/or circumstances occur which would require an extension of this performance period, the selected contractor should immediately provide documentation to the CO and the POC as to the reason and extent of the abnormal requirements and/or circumstances that caused the delay in completing the work according to the schedule. The selected contractor shall also provide the best estimate of the extension required.

Insurance against Loss or Damage to Government Property

The selected contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the performance of this work a minimum of $2,000,000.00 of insurance.  The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government’s interest shall not be effective:
a)	For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe; or
b)	Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.

Delivery Requirements

The cost of shipping the aircraft to and from the selected contractor facility shall be the responsibility of the Government.


Submittal of Invoices

The selected contractor shall submit invoices to the designated AOC point of contact at the address specified in the order.  All invoices will be reviewed by the designated AOC point of contact to determine if the Government has received the best value for the services provided in accordance with the price schedule.
