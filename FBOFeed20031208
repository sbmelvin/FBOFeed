<DESC>The 118-K-1 Burial Ground has been described as a "general content burial ground" and is representative of the type of burial ground at Hanford reactor areas that operated from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s.  Attributes of the 118-K-1 Burial Ground include the following:

* The burial ground is approximately 366 m (1200 ft) x 183 m (600 ft) and consists of numerous trenches and pits of various sizes that contain the waste materials.
* Six underground vertical silos, each 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and 7.6 m (25 ft) deep, were used to hold reactor hardware that had high dose rates.
* Three underground vertical silos, each 9.1 m (30 ft) long and 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter contain ashes from an incinerator built in 1968 that was dismantled and buried at the site.
* Two underground vertical silos, each 9.8 m (32 ft) long and 1.4 m (4.5 ft) in diameter contain irradiated nickel-plated boron steel balls from the reactor emergency 3X system. 

In addition, a wide range of above cleanup level material such as soil, ash, miscellaneous debris, intact containers, buried equipment, soft waste, and structural materials may be encountered during remedial action activities.

It also includes professional engineering and civil survey services to support the Subcontractor preparation and submittal of work plans, "Issued For Construction" drawings prior to commencement of work, and "as-built" drawings upon completion of specific work activities.  These services will detail the waste site and structures in the footprint of the waste site, proposed support areas (e.g. lay-down areas, support facilities), and engineering support during field activities.

This work scope also includes performance of operations necessary to excavate, sort, size reduce, stage, containerize/package, load, weigh, maintain and transport above cleanup level materials from the 118-K-1 Burial Ground to the container transfer area in accordance with the Subcontract Documents.  In addition, this work scope includes waste transport container tarping and maintenance, specialty packaging and maintenance, stockpiling of below cleanup level materials, on-site access control, and housekeeping in accordance with the Subcontract Documents.


Potential bidders will be required to be pre-qualified by BHI.  A Pre-Qualification Questionnaire is available on the BHI web site at http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm.

<SUBJECT>B--Alternatives to Individual Crop Insurance Program Research, Development and Implementation for Small Value Crops for USDA Risk Management Agency
<SOLNBR>0404RP32969
<RESPDATE>122203
<ARCHDATE>12072004
<CONTACT>Richard P.  Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage the following procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA).  Since 1938, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) has developed and refined Federal crop insurance programs for many midwestern crops.  Legislative modifications implemented in 1980 expanded FCIC's authority and scope by releasing many of the prior expansion constraints.  Further modifications in 1996 continued the trend for even more expansion by releasing FCIC from even more constraints.  In 2002 FCIC offered Federal crop insurance programs for 362 crops, and 22 pilot insurance programs.  These programs provided producers in excess of $37 billion protection in force and generate nearly $3 billion in premium.  Federal crop insurance programs have gained popularity among producers as a risk management tool that can restore producer's income following serious production shortfalls.  Growing producer demand for similar tools by producers of crops with small national value presents a unique challenge for RMA to be responsive to small value crop producers and fulfill its legislative mandate to expansion the insured crop inventory.  RMA's dilemma is that Federal crop insurance program development is a costly and time-consuming process.  It is possible that lesser-valued crop program development expense could exceed the producer's benefit.  Therefore, RMA is seeking alternatives to its present individual program development model and opportunities to reduce development cost and time.  If you are interested in proposing on this project, please send your email request for complete RFP documentation and Statement of Objectives to: richard.bolick@mms.gov no later than COB December 22, 2003.  REFERENCE RFP 1435-04-04-RP-32969.  The Government anticipates that a level of effort contract will be awarded.  The Government's cost estimate for this project is based on approximately 12,900 professional labor hours.  Program details and proposal requirements will be provided with the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A--MULTI-SOURCE INTEGRATION SYSTEM (MSI) EVALUATION DURING THE COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE EXERCISE 2004  (CJTFEX 04)
<SOLNBR>N0002404R5105
<CONTACT>LCDR Kristin Acquavella  (202) 781-4175 NAVSEA Contracts: LCDR Kristin Acquavella (202) 781-4175; acquavellak@navsea.navy.mil
<DESC>The Joint Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) System Engineering Organization (JSSEO), in concert with United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and Joint Theatre Air and Missile Defense Organization (JTAMDO), solicits interest for participation in controlled field and laboratory test activities to evaluate the performance of existing Aerospace Warfare Command and Control (C2) Multi-Source Integrator (MSI) system demonstrations.  The JSSEO, in support of Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM) development, will conduct a SIAP metrics evaluation of MSI Systems at CJTFEX 04 that will include new MSI-related Measures of Performance (MOPs). As part of the process of refining these MOPs, the government will include contractor participation by awarding up to five competitive firm fixed-price contracts in the amount of $15,000.00 each.  Successful contractors will be selec ted based on evaluation of technical proposals only.  Evaluation criteria will be set forth in request for proposals (RFP) N00024-04-R-5105 following the Pre-solicitation Industry Day.  CJTFEX Participation: During the exercise, contractors will be provided Government-furnished facilities and live signals from data sources including: FAA radars (9); AN/TPS-59 radars (2); AN/TPS-75 radar (1); Military Tactical data links (Link 11 and Link 16);; FAA flight data input/output; near real-time observations (e.g., take-off times/waypoints); Air Tasking Order (ATO) exercise plans; and time synchronization source.  Low frequency and microwave electronic support measures may also be provided as a data source. Contractors will deliver, in real time on an Ethernet port, the output data produced by their MSI system translated into the prescribed Performance Evaluation Tool (PET) format.   At the conclusion of each exercise period (as notified) the contractor will deliver on a CD-ROM or equivalent, a recording (in PET format) of the sensor data used by their system.  During the exercise, the contractor will record in the MSI automated logging system any information that affects the performance of their MSI system (such as system outage, data feed loss, and software changes).    Each participant will be required to deliver to JSSEO by 30 September 2004 a short report detailing the performance of their system in terms of the JSSEO MSI measures of performance for a specified period(s) of the exercise; the aggregate time to be analyzed will not exceed three hours. The period to be used will be provided to each participant within ten days from the end of the exercise. To support their analysis the participants will be provided with truth/reference data for the sel ected times and other information deemed of value. The government reserves the right to conduct a parallel evaluation of each system's performance using the same metrics. The delivered report shall contain at a minimum: 	An executive summary 	Diagram or description of test configuration, components and products 	A discussion on the appropriateness of each of the MSI MOPs A discussion of any problems found in the calculation of the MOPs 	Suggestions as to how the MOPs might be modified/clarified 	Suggestions for any additional MOPs 	The MSI MOPs actually achieved by the vendor's system To conduct the analysis, the participants may choose to rerun their system using data gathered at the event. However, if the version of the system used for the analysis is not identical to that used at the live-fly exercise, then the variations and the reasons for their adoption are  to be described in detail. For no additional cost to the Government, the contractor may, at its discretion, present its findings and recommendations to the SIAP MSI Analysis Team in September 2004. Results from these contracts will be used to refine the MSI MOPs for testing and evaluating MSI system capability.  These MOPs will be used to refine SIAP MOP Technical Report, which can be found at Defense Scientific and Technology Information Network (DTIC) link:  http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/fulcrum_main.pl?database=TR_U2&database=FT_u2&numrecords= 25&search.DOC_TEXT=SIAP.  Testing will be taken into a laboratory environment for further assessment of the Industry MSI capability.  Note:  RFI N00024-04-R-5102 for the Relevant to Rapid Innovation Assessment in fostering innovation for the development of the IABM is a separate request.  However, the two are rela ted in that the Integrated Architecture Behavior Model being developed by JSSEO, will have data fusion and other MSI capability that may come from industry solutions that meet specified requirements.  PRE-SOLICITATION INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING FOR POTENTIAL CJTFEX 04 CONTRACTORS.   Contractors who express an interest in RFP N00024-04-R-5105 will be invited to participate in a Pre-Solicitation Industry Day scheduled for 21 January 2003 at Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc., 1225 Jefferson Davis Highway, Crystal Gateway 2, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia 22202, (703) 413-4399. The government will provide a briefing with additional information regarding the planning for CJTFEX 04 followed by an open forum for potential offerors to provide feedback to the JSSEO MSI Team. Breakout sessions will be available from 1300-1700 to discuss any contractual, technical or company-specific issu es.  Interested participants are strongly encouraged to provide an adequate level of technical representation at the meeting as information received from industry will be considered prior to release of the RFP.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to secure a complete set of services that have historically been accomplished by numerous individual contracts.  Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, and services to construct modified fuel profile zones, treat and remove products, treat miscellaneous noxious weed/plants, treat riparian reserves and reduce fuels during the period of July 2003 to November 1, 2004 on the Weaverville Ranger District, Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Trinity County, California.  In the past, contracts have been awarded for logging, fuel reduction, wildlife enhancement and stream channel protection/enhancement in the same general area.  Each of these was designed to meet the management objectives for a narrow range of resources.  Fuel reduction was for fire management and silviculture goals; logging was for timber and fire management goals, wildlife enhancement for recruiting wildlife habitat and soils concerns: and stream channel protection/enhancement was for fishery, soils, and hydrology goals.  This contract combines all of these operations into one contract to take advantage of the efficiencies of having one larger operation to meet multiple objectives.  Approximately 630 acres in one bid item will be treated with a combination of the following treatments.  Work consists of product treatment and removal (logging by helicopter and ground-based equipment), hand cutting live, dead and damaged vegetation, riparian reserve hand piling/burning, grapple piling, lopping and scattering, mastication, hand piling whole units, and fireline construction.  Estimated start work date is July 2003 with a contract time of 2 years.  There will be a pre-bid tour; date and time will be announced in the solicitation.  Solicitation will be a Request for Proposal with the evaluation criteria clearly identified in Section M.  Solicitation documents will be available for downloading off this website on or about May 13, 2003.

<DESC>Market Survey and Request for Information

The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement’s has a requirement to procure ammunition. 
The Department of State is conducting market research for any small business source and or companies that can provide the following ammunition: 5.56 mm Ball, NSN 1305-01-155-5449 Min 12,480 Max 4,000,000, 7.62 mm 4 ball/ Tracer for minigun, NSN 1305-00-926-3942 Min 5,046,000 Max 10,000,000, 9mm ball NSN 1305-01-172-9558 Min 6,240 ea, Max 20,000.  Military specifications must be met and the ammunition must be manufactured in the United States. The delivery location will be to the freight forwarder located in Miami Florida, the awardee will be required to obtain the export license and end user certificate and any other requirement to move the ammunition into Colombia. 
The government is requesting that industry identify their capabilities of the businesses that may be interested in this effort. The anticipated method of procurement will be to utilize a fixed price IDIQ (Base year plus four one year options) and award to the technically acceptable low price contractor. Please identify potential problem areas, and provide recommendations for industry standards. The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing possible cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with this requirement. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to identify capable firms.

It is the Government’s intention to make ONE award.  All interested business concerns shall identify their interest by providing the company name, capabilities, mailing address, phone number, and electronic mail address to the contracting office. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals. The use of information received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the government. Any subsequent solicitations will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The government will not critique a potential offeror’s information and the RFI should not be used by offerors to market their services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited. Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. 

Submit responses no later than 17 November  2003, via email. 

Internet and e-mail capabilities are a must!  

Point(s) of contact. Reply to Lisa C. Goodwine, please reply to goodwinelc@state.gov.

Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information received.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources within 10 days after the publication of this synopsis.  See numbered note 22.

STATEMENT OF WORK BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) believes taxpayer audits are a necessary tool for maintaining the integrity and fairness of the Federal income tax.  However, a recent Treasury Department study has expressed concern about a decline in audit rates and its potential impact on voluntary compliance.  TIGTA (2002) reports that the number of income tax return examinations fell 51 percent, from 1.6 million to 779,000 returns examined, between Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 to 2001, while the number of income tax returns filed grew 8 percent, from 128 million to 138 million returns.  Thus, overall income tax examination coverage fell 56 percent for this period, from 1.27 percent of all income tax returns filed to 0.56 percent, while the associated recommended assessments declined 29 percent, from $24.9 billion to $17.7 billion (TIGTA, 2002).  In addition to these direct impacts on Federal tax revenues, several studies have reported a deterrent effect of taxpayer audits.  In an econometric study for the years 1977-1986, Dubin, Graetz and Wilde (1990) found that for every dollar of revenue produced because of taxpayer audits, an additional six dollars of revenue were generated from the indirect or “ripple” effects.  However, the results of other studies have been mixed.  Tauchen, Witte and Beron (1989), using random taxpayer audit data from the 1969 Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP), find that raising the audit rate had an impact only on high-income wage and salary workers.   For this group of taxpayers, they estimate an indirect effect of audits to be almost three times the direct revenue effect.  Blumental, Christian and Slemrod (1998) describe a controlled field study carried out with the Minnesota Department of Revenue.  In their experiment, a stratified sample was selected based on three levels of 1993 income: low-income with adjusted gross income (AGI) less than $10,000, middle-income with AGI between $10,000 and $100,000, and high-income with AGI over $100,000.  The sample was split into a treatment group and a control group.  The Minnesota Department of Revenue informed the treatment group by mail that both their state and Federal income tax returns would be “closely examined.” In contrast to Tauchen, Witte and Beron (1989), the resulting differences in reported income and tax liability between the treatment group and the control group show that the heightened threat of examination increases reporting compliance among low and middle-income taxpayers, but among high-income taxpayers compliance actually decreased.  The authors interpret their findings as an indication of a more aggressive negotiating position on the part of high-income taxpayers in anticipation of an audit.  Finally, an internal IRS study (Plumley, 1996) found that taxpayer examinations have a strongly significant impact on reporting compliance.  Using an econometric approach and state-level data for the period 1982-1991, the study finds that for every $1.00 in tax adjustments on an examination opened in 1991, $11.60 of additional tax was voluntarily reported on individual income tax returns as a deterrent effect.  The report estimates that if “face-to-face” examination rates had been held constant at the 1982 level of 1.62 percent (instead of declining to 0.65 percent in 1991), an additional $257 billion of tax would have been voluntarily reported due to the indirect effect.  Clearly, this finding supports the theoretical conclusion that increasing audit rates would improve voluntary compliance.  How audits deter taxpayers from evading is not well understood.  According to Plumley (1996), “It is generally believed, for example, that many taxpayers would perceive increased auditing by IRS as an increase in their chances of being audited, and that they would improve their voluntary compliance as a result.” From this description, it is clear that audit-based deterrence depends on taxpayer awareness of the level and year-to-year change in examination rates as a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition.  Therefore, a valid test for the existence of indirect effects must ensure taxpayers are aware of the likelihood of audit.   This is unlikely to be the case using data from random taxpayer audits.  A greater degree of control is possible in field studies but such data also may contain a broad array of exogenous influences, such as changes in tax law or economic conditions that may cause taxpayers to change their behavior during the period of study.  The purpose of this study is to use an experimental approach to measure the indirect effects of taxpayer examinations using the standard expected utility model of tax evasion.  A high-level experimental design for estimating the indirect effects of audits is proposed.  The proposed experiment builds on previous work by improving parallelism with taxpayers’ decision framework.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Anita Middleton, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-0828 x129, Fax 301-713-0806, Email Anita.R.Middleton@noaa.gov
<DESC>Amendment 0004 is being issued to answer questions submitted on December 08, 2003.  The due date for the proposal remains unchanged.  (Q1) What often has NOAA asked for patches/drivers in the past?  What was the level-of-effort (LOE) required before the solicitation?  (A1) The number of patches required in the past is not a useful indicator of how many will be required in the future.  New security policies will require that NWS install patches for all reported vulnerabilities, whereas in the past other risk reduction procedures (e.g. firewalls) were deemed acceptable.  Most of the required drivers were bundled with the Red Hat 7.2 distribution.  Probably about ten drivers have had to be added over the last two years.  (Q2) What is the configuration of the Linux machines that will need support (i.e. services, hardware platforms, etc.)?  (A2) There are various different platforms, and more may be procured during the life of the contract.  All are Intel x86-based and all are 32 bit.  In other particulars they vary considerably.  One large subclass consists of IBM Xeon-based (Intellistation) graphics workstations with two CPUs, three graphics displays, and two graphics cards (one Matrox, one Nvidia).  (Q3) How many servers does are included under this solicitation?  (A3) Most of the machines in question are graphics workstations.  There are probably a few hundred servers.  Please note that the NWS will handle all deployment and installation of patches.  The number of machines should not affect the bid.  (Q4) Do you plan to upgrade to a more current version of Red Hat during the contract terms?  If so will, who do the implementation?  And if not, why are you staying with Red Hat 7.2?  (A4) NWS future plans on utilizing Linux operating system are undefined at this time.  Because of the undefined future requirement, NWS needs to keep the present versions of Red Hat running through the time period stated within this requirement.  (Q5) What services is the current version of Red Hat 7.2 running?  (A5) That information is not available.  Vendors should plan to be able to provide security patches for any services included in the Red Hat 7.2 distribution, or in the other distributions if they are bidding those as well.  (Q6) What is the dollar amount of the current support contract?  And if there is one, who is the incumbent?  (A6) There is no current support contract.  Patches have been downloaded as needed from the Red Hat errata site and deployed from NWS servers. (End of Amendment 0004)  This posting is being accomplished to add Amendment 0003 and to put all the amendments together in one document.  Amendment 0003 is being issued to answer questions submitted on December 04, 2003.  Questions (Q) and Answers (A).  (Q1) Is the contractor required to monitor relevant Linux news, mailing lists, and other relevant sites to know when a patch must be created, or is the contractor notified by NOAA when a patch is required?  (A1) The contractor is not required to monitor mailing lists and other news sources.  NOAA will ask for the patches that are required.  But the contractor should note that security patches must be provided within five business days of when they are requested, so the contractor may gain valuable lead time by monitoring web sites that announce security vulnerabilities.  (Q2) Once the updated RPMs are created, do they become full property of the NOAA?  If specific code level changes are required to the supplied patches, per the GPL these must be re-released under the GPL.  Does the NOAA have a restriction against this?  May the contractor have license to redistribute these RPMs in any capacity? (A2) NOAA places no restrictions on what the contractor may do with any software created under this contract.  NOAA gets full use of the software, with no restrictions on use other than those imposed by the GPL or whatever other public license the underlying software may be governed by.  The contractor retains the same rights.  (Q3) Since service is expected to begin on January 1, 2004, by what date will the decision be made as to which contractor is chosen?  (A3) On current schedule, the decision will be announced by December 19, 2003.  The Government will not make its first request for a patch until at least two weeks have elapsed after award announcement.  (Q4) In regards to Past Performance, would you classify general Linux patching experience as more or less important than general C programming experience?  (A4) The Government expects that the major work required by this contract will be taking publicly available source code patches and building and re-packaging them for the specific distribution being patched.  So while experience in both C programming and patch preparation are important, patch preparation is more important.  We do not expect a significant amount of new C programming will be required for this task.  Amendment 0002 is being issued to add the Red Hat versions 7.3 and 9 to the support coverage.  Follow the below instructions when submitting.  Address these two versions separately as shown below.  Provide pricing separately and then pricing for all four versions.  (End of Amendment 0002)  Amendment 0001 is being issued to provide Questions and Answers, to include version 8.0 as part of the support, and to require separate technical and pricing submissions for three scenarios.  Questions (Q) and Answers (A):  (Q1) What type of support does the Government require?  Is it 24/7 or normal business hours?  (A1) The most important element of support is provision of patches.  The vendor should place the patches on a server that the Government can access at the Government’s convenience via ftp or sftp.  Other requests for support will be rare, and will be during normal business hours.  (Q2) Will the support require onsite, offsite, or a combination of both support?  (A2) The Government expects that requests for support (other than provision of patches) will be rare.  Such requests will usually be handled by telephone, but it is possible that visits to Government integration and test facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area may be required.  (Q3) How many systems will require Red 7.2 patch/driver support?  (A3) The Government will handle all patch deployment and other “per machine” issues, so the number of systems involved should not be relevant.  User-level support is handled by currently existing engineering staff.  Somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 machines are involved.  Up to two NWS programs may be involved, so there will be at most two different machine configurations.  (Q4) Will the Government furnish equipment at the contractor’s site for testing of developed patches/drives?  (A4) No. Routine testing of patches may be done on commodity Intel x86 hardware with the contractor is expected to own.  Testing of hardware-specific patches may require visits to the Government’s integration and test facilities in the Washington Metropolitan Area.  (Q5) How does the Government require the deployment of patches/drivers?  By onsite, offsite link, or best means method?  The Government recommends that the patches be loaded on to the contractor’s ftp or sftp server.  Up to three Government IP addresses should be granted access to the server to download patches.  Contractor’s server should have a reliable internet connection providing data transfer speed of at least 600 kilobits per second.  According to the commercial definition and the performance based acquisition solution, the contractor needs to come up with the best solution that will meet the Government’s needs.  The contractor must be able to stand by any solution provided to the Government.  (Q6) Will the Government provide the contractor any office/test bench space at the Government location?  (A6) If onsite testing or consultation is required, the Government will provide the necessary access and facilities on an ad-hoc basis.  (Q7) Does the Government require a Time and Material or a Cost Plus quotation?  (A7) The Government is expecting a firm-fixed price quotation.  This is a commercial acquisition and commercial acquisition can only be firm-fixed price methodology.  If the contractor is asked to provide additional services besides supporting the Red Hat, the contractor will need to provide labor categories and labor rates for that type of work.  The Government will provide a line item for a not-to-exceed amount for this particular purpose.  (End of Questions and Answers)  All additional information will be shown within the solicitation via quotations.  (End of Amendment)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE	:	o/a March 15, 2004 to March 14, 2006
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE	:	Manila, Philippines
JOB DESCRIPTION	:

A.	BACKGROUND

The Philippines education system was once one of the best in all of Asia.  However, the system has deteriorated drastically over the last generation in both quality and access.  Key comparative advantages (including English language capability) are eroding.  President Arroyo and education analysts have raised concern about the decline in English language competency and general academic performance among Philippines graduates.  There is also recognition of the need for teacher training in all subject matter with particular emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT).  The President, to address the decline in educational performance, has required that math and science return to English as the language of instruction.  

The situation is most acute in Mindanao and within the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in particular.  The ARMM remains the poorest area of the Philippines and has correspondingly low social indicators.  The quality of education is typically poor. 

Improved access to quality education is widely seen by the Filipino people as a means to a better life.  It can play an important role in helping Filipinos become more effective players in the country's pluralistic and democratic state.  Improved education will help level the playing field and reduce marginalization of poor populations to enable them to compete for employment opportunities and participate more fully in economic growth.  

USAID/Philippines new education program intends to improve access to, and the quality of, education. Efforts will focus particularly on reducing the differences between education opportunities in Mindanao, especially the ARMM and other conflict-affected areas, and the rest of the nation.  The program also will address the special problems of out-of-work youth in the conflict-affected areas. It will help address systemic weaknesses, including corruption in the provision of goods and services.  Activities will include: (1) expanding and improving community-based learning activities in both formal and non-formal education sectors; (2) enhancing capacity for teaching math, science and English; (3) improving education sector policies at the local and national levels; and (4) reintegrating out-of-school youth in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.  USAID/Philippines will implement this program through local partners in collaboration with a U.S. Government (USG) interagency working group including the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Service (PAS) and the Peace Corps (PC), and other donors.  USAID will also encourage U.S. and Philippine private sector groups involved in education through corporate social responsibility programs to play an important role by engaging in productive partnerships. USAID will also incorporate other efforts already underway.   

Under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao - 2 Program (GEM-2), USAID/Philippines has started activities in education in the ARMM that are already producing encouraging results.  The supported programs aim to (a) increase community awareness of major education problems in the ARMM; (b) help various groups (i.e., parents¡¦ groups, business organizations) improve schools; (c) build the educational planning and analysis capacity of the ARMM Department of Education; (d) improve the English language skills of both school children and the general public; (e) increase computer literacy and internet access in selected schools; and (f) provide selected interventions in key vocational institutions.  GEM-2 is also supporting an internship program for some 15-20 recent graduates of ARMM colleges and universities who will spend some 4-6 months each working as interns in the Philippines House of Representatives.  The Program aims to help the interns develop a greater understanding of the role of Congress in shaping the economic development of the Philippines, and thus play a key role in USAID¡¦s attempts to improve both governance and education in the ARMM.  The new education SO will incorporate these promising activities into the new programs, including possibly replicating successful interventions in other conflict-affected and/or disadvantaged areas of the Philippines.    

As part of the Education SO, USAID/Philippines also recently signed an agreement with the Peace Corps for a Pilot Education Assistance Program. The Program, which will benefit the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao, is designed to enhance the capacity of Mindanao¡¦s public school teachers, instructional staff and student teachers.  The program will provide training for them in English education, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) and content-based instruction methodologies and techniques in Math, Science, Health and Environment to enhance their lesson-planning and classroom skills.  

Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, creativity and innovation, discussions and negotiations with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), the ARMM government, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID¡¦s newer substantive involvement in this sector.  The emphasis on public-private sector partnerships also requires significant similar engagement with local and international corporate philanthropic organizations, and NGOs.   

B.	STATEMENT OF WORK

The Senior Education Advisor will serve as the senior technical and policy advisor, as well as Team Leader for the USAID/Philippines Education Sector programs and projects to be designed and implemented under the new, recently approved Mission six-year SO.  USAID expects to support a combination of financing arrangements for these activities, e.g., bilateral grant with the GRP or the ARMM, direct umbrella arrangements, grants/cooperative agreements to international organizations, corporate foundations and NGOs, direct contacts, as well as to rely on global field support arrangements where relevant and practicable. 
  
The specific duties and responsibilities of the Senior Education Advisor shall be:

	1.	Technical and Policy Advisor to the Mission for the Education Program  

„«	Advise USAID and other USG officials of trends and constraints (e.g., financing, political will and administrative capacity) and provide technical recommendations on opportunities that can promote the education sector agenda in the Philippines, with special attention to the conflict affected areas. 
„«	Lead in planning/design, negotiation, management, monitoring and evaluation of education program activities (and any related technical/vocational training and higher education initiatives).  The scope of this advice includes issues related to quality as well as access. 
„«	Carry-out and support policy dialogue on issues such as financing and quality with GRP (central and local) and ARMM officials, donors and corporate and other nongovernmental organizations in consultation with Mission staff. 
„«	Prepare technical and other reports and draft speeches, concept papers, position papers, talking points and briefs for the Mission Director, other senior USAID officials and the Ambassador on education sector issues. 
„«	Draft or oversee the drafting of project scopes of work and program descriptions to compete and award acquisition and/or assistance instruments to implement technical programs in the areas highlighted above. 

2.	Program Management and Oversight 

„«	Provide leadership to a multidisciplinary team as well as to partner implementing organizations in achieving the education SO to ensure that planned development results are achieved in a highly efficient, timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies.
„«	Supervise the education sector team and two FSN Education Officers (one for education policy, systems and programs, and the other for education finance and collaboration) in monitoring of program and project implementation activities.  
„«	Provide policy and operational guidance to contractors and grantees.  
„«	Review, critique and approve annual work plans and related financial documentation for compliance with USAID requirements. 
„«	Identify and work with contractors/grantees and GRP and ARMM counterparts to resolve issues affecting the achievement of results. 
„«	Supervise the development of data collection systems for monitoring of program/project impacts. 
„«	Review and supervise preparation of requisite USAID documents, e.g., semi-annual and annual program performance reports. 
„«	Provide substantive input in establishing performance monitoring systems for results frameworks. 
„«	Perform or supervise the conduct of program evaluations and assessments. 
 
3.	Coordination 

„«	Ensure effective coordination of USAID-funded activities with those of other donors working with the GRP and the ARMM.   
„«	Promote convergence and expansion of effective strategies and approaches that can expand coverage and quality of education services (including those being promoted through the use of information and communication technologies) especially for vulnerable populations (poor/females/out-of-school youths) particularly in the conflict affected areas.
„«	Develop, nurture and sustain close collaborative, professional relationships with senior (secretary-level) GRP central and local level officials, ARMM officials, other major donors like the World Bank, ADB, the Japanese and AUSAID, corporate philanthropic foundations (in the US and in Philippines), international organizations and leading education research institutions.
„«	Enlist support from other donors, senior government officials, business sector leaders and non-government organizations for policy changes that will overcome program implementation issues or facilitate replication of positive program results. 
„«	Carryout and support policy dialogue with senior GRP and ARMM officials and other bilateral and/or multilateral donor officials in consultation with the USDH Deputy Mission Director and the USAID/Philippines Mission Director.
„«	Develop and maintain a collaborative, professional relationship with the U.S. Ambassador, senior members of the broader US Mission team, senior GRP and ARMM officials at both the national and local levels, representatives of the U.S. Peace Corps, U.S. Department of Labor, and other donor and corporate organizations supporting human development programs in the Philippines and with USAID-funded implementing partners.
„«	Represent USAID at donor and other international forums on education issues. 
 
C.	RELATIONSHIPS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Senior Education Advisor will work under the general supervision and policy guidance of the USDH-FEOC Deputy Mission Director, USAID/Philippines.  The Deputy Mission Director will review and approve the Advisor¡¦s work plan and performance measures.  Supervision will be generally confined to weekly staff meetings and informal daily and/or weekly consultations.

<DESC>****************MODIFICATION FOR SECOND PART******************
Due to the critical importance of the Autoclave Electronic Control System (AECS) to Depot operations, only contractors with strong past performance in state of the art computer hardware and software upgrade capabilities should respond.  In addition, this requirement is time sensitive and all proposals should emphasize the ability of the contractor to rapidly design, manufacture, install, and acceptance test the upgrades within the shortest timeframe possible, thereby minimizing the potential for the NADEP to experience work stoppage due to downtime.  The contractor shall deliver to:  UIC N65886, Naval Air Depot, Building 101, Code 62338, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL 32212-0016.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination, FOB destination.  
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In making its award determination, the Government will first determine whether an offeror's proposal satisfies the Government's technical requirements as contained in this RFP.  If an offeror's proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  Once the technical acceptability determinations are completed, all offerors' proposals with an upgrade program determined to meet the Government's technical requirements will be evaluated considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:
Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty
Past Performance
Price
Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  Furthermore, time is of the essence and Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty, individually, is more important than either Past Performance or Price.  
Delivery, installation and acceptance testing of the AECS upgrade are critical to ensuring continued production capability at the NADEP.  As such, proposals that contain an accelerated delivery schedule will receive a more favorable evaluation under the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty factor.  
For the Past Performance factor, the offeror shall describe its past performance on similar or related contracts it has held within the last five (5) years which are similar to the requirements in this RFP or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant related or similar past performance. Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of this RFP. The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:
1.  Contract Number(s),
2.  Name and phone number of a point of contact at the federal, state, local government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
3.  Dollar value of the contract,
4.  Detailed description of the work performed,
5.  Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor, and  
6.  The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action.

If an offeror's proposal is determined to be unacceptable in either the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty factor or the Past Performance factor, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.  
The following FAR clauses are incorporated by reference and apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items (Oct 2000); 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb. 2002); 52.233-3, Protest After Award (Aug 1996); and 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items (May 2002).

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to address Questions and Answers in response to Solicitation Number USSS040008. Question: 1)The original synopsis/socilitation states the need for six (6) three-day classes in the Base Period. After modifying the solicitation, are these numbers still accurate (six sessions, three days each)?  Since the course content is different than originally stated and because the original solicitation asked for twenty-four (24) students per class (now eight), it would seem that these numbers might be different. Answer: Yes, the classes will be for 3 days, 6 sessions per year.  Question: 2) Will the first session still be scheduled for December 9-11, 2003, as originally stated in the Solicitation? Answer: Yes, the first session is scheduled for December 9-11, 2003.

<SUBJECT>NAVY INDUSTRY DAY AT THE NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE CENTER, PORT HUENEME DIVISION, PORT HUENEME, CALIFORNIA
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division is hosting an Industry Day to be held onsite on January 28, 2004 from 8:00AM until 1:00PM.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide Vendors the opportunity to gain information and observe first hand, current systems and technologies used by the US Navy and the Naval Surface Warfare Center.  The desire is to use this event to build interest for future proposals from Vendors on new technologies and innovative systems to enhance the Navy’s distance support capabilities, including remote maintenance and systems monitoring, in a shipboard environment. This event will include presentations on Next Generation In-Service Engineering, the Surface Ship Combat Systems Product Area, the Readiness Concept Center, and SeaPort II.  Following the presentations, an informational tour of the Ex - USS PAUL F. FOSTER, a remote control led Self-Defense Test Ship, will be conducted.  The tour of the Self Defense Test Ship will provide Vendors with a prospective of the ship’s operations and maintenance as well as mission specifics.     The ship’s primary mission is At-Sea Testing of Advanced Weapons Systems.  Systems on the ship that are common to many other fleet units include Gas Turbine Propulsion, Navigation, Communications and Combat Systems.  Both in port and at-sea testing is conducted allowing a true shipboard environment for data collection and evaluation.  In addition, the ship serves as a floating laboratory available for use without the scheduling problems that can be associated with a commissioned ship.  This is a guided tour in a small group setting and there will be Navy subject matter experts in the areas of Gas Turbine Propulsion, Navigation, Communications and Combat Systems available to answ er questions.     Vendors who have an interest in these areas, are familiar with the Navy needs and have a vision of how their technology would be of use to the Navy are invited to participate in the industry day events.  Attendance is limited to one representative per Vendor per location. There are no registration fees associated with this event and travel or other expenses are the responsibility of the Vendor.  Vendors interested in participating should contact the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division Public Affairs Office at PAO@phdnswc.navy.mil, or phone (805) 228-6150, for a registration package.  Advanced registration must be received by NSWC Port Hueneme by close of business 07 January 2004 for security clearance and access to the Naval Base Ventura County.

<ZIP>20590
<OFFADD>Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), MAR-380, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 7310, Washington, DC, 20590
<SUBJECT>P -- The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels
<DESC>The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is seeking innovative engineering/technical/ production/management solutions for the disposal of multiple obsolete vessels located in the reserve fleet sites in the James River, VA (JRRF); Suisun Bay, CA (SBRF); and Beaumont, TX (BRF).  A complete listing of obsolete vessels is located in the PRDA library for informational purposes.  The list of ships is subject to change.  Some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.  MARAD anticipates that the obsolete vessels in the worst condition, many of which are located in the James River Reserve Fleet, may be disposed of using traditional competitive contracting practices, depending on the availability of funding.  

In an effort to obtain maximum program flexibility, the Government is seeking, from public and private concerns innovative solutions for the disposal of the remaining obsolete vessels by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2006.  The use and/or development of Government facilities are not excluded.


Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to the PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

- Innovative engineering/technical/production/management approaches for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified on the list in the PRDA library.
- Environmental and worker safety/health considerations associated with the disposal of obsolete vessels and the abatement of hazardous materials
- Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
- Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with the disposal of obsolete vessels
- Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach
In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

- Feasibility and likelihood of success of engineering/technical/management approach for the disposal of obsolete vessels identified in the PRDA library and the risks associated with the proposed approach
- Productivity of the proposed approach(s) including schedule/cost assessments
- Type and sufficiency of proposed environmental, worker safety and health considerations proposed and compliance with applicable laws
- Type and sufficiency of proposed abatement of hazardous materials and compliance with applicable laws
- Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the complete disposal of obsolete vessels
- Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed engineering/technical/management solution


In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price.   
Historically, the annual program level associated with MARAD ship disposal has been $10 million. The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised/competed.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or proposal(s) in their entirety to implement innovative solutions offered. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS:
To be given evaluation consideration, submissions in response to this PRDA must conform to the following standards:
A. Technical/engineering/production/management solutions, inclusive of the listing below, shall not exceed 25 typewritten pages, single sided, single spaced, Arial, 12 pitch:
- Production throughput/capacity
- Environmental considerations
- Worker safety and health considerations
- Hazardous abatement considerations
- Requisite experience

B. Funding/pricing requirements must be proposed in sufficient enough detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel(s), including cost categories such as towing, remediation of hazardous materials, labor costs etc, as appropriate. Pricing information must be detailed enough to permit the Government to make a determination of cost realism and reasonableness when assessed against the proposed approach. Submission of funding/pricing information shall not exceed 3 typewritten pages, single sided, single-spaced, Arial, 12 pitch.
C. A Technical Compliance Plan prepared in accordance with the instructions found in the PRDA library shall be provided with each proposal submitted.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  Items being considered are: Paper Shredders (7520-00-NIB-1695 - Strip cut model with daily capacity of 2,000-4,000 sheets, 7/32 inch strips with 18-20 sheet capacity); (7520-00-NIB-1696 - Confetti cut model considered a confidential security cut with daily capacity of 2,000-4000 sheets, 5/32 inch X 1 inch particles - 12-14 sheet capacity); Digital visitor registration and photo ID badging system (7530-00-NIB-0097, -0098, and -0754 through -0764 - The digital security visitor registration and photo badging system creates and prints color photo name badges, stores visitor information, and generates detailed visitor activity reports.  Compatible with standard USB based inkjet printers, web cameras and scanners).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<CONTACT>Richard P.  Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-16. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-32970 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  BACKGROUND:  This solicitation is a result of both the "Multiple Year Coverage Risk Management Program" and "Performance-Based Premium Rate Discount Study" recommendations.  The US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA) is interested in receiving a product that best incorporates the recommendations of both studies.  Since the "Performance-Based Premium Rate Discount" project only addresses the producers who have good insurance experience, the contractor in this development phase shall also research whether the designed discount, or modified version, is applicable to new insureds with good production history.  Additionally, the contractor shall consider premium lost by offering a discount program and report to RMA how this will affect the actuarial soundness of the program, i.e. poor experience surcharge, base rate implications, etc.  The contractor shall conduct research and gather any information necessary to support the recommended design of a preferred producer discount for the designated commodities and states.  The contractor shall gather data necessary for the credible operation of the preferred producer discount.  Data for all parameters shall be obtained as necessary and reviewed by the contractor for accuracy and credibility.  The contractor shall design a pilot program that offers a preferred producer discount for the existing commodities and plans of insurance in the pilot areas in Section 2.1 of this solicitation.  The contractor shall provide justification if any additional commodities and/or pilot areas are recommended.  The contractor shall determine if the discount design, or a modification of the design, can be given to new producers with good production history.  The contractor shall research and address the effects of collecting fewer premiums, due to a discount program, and determine any changes that should occur to the crop insurance program to achieve actuarial soundness, i.e. poor experience surcharge, base rate implications, etc.  The design shall be actuarially sound and consistent with the other subsections of the SOW.  The program design, data sources, and methods of gathering data shall be documented in the report.  The Government anticipates that this will be a firm fixed price award, and reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government cost estimate for this project is based on approximately 2850 professional labor hours of effort.  FOR AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF THE COMPLETE SOW FOR THIS RFP, PLEASE GO TO http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp AND LOOK UP THIS RFP NUMBER: 1435-04-04-RP-32970.  Period of Performance:  See specific SOW documents for details.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, (A) A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the effort, including subcontractors) with their qualifications and specific experience;  (2) specific organizational experience for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization have performed within the last two years; and (3) overall past performance including specific references (include contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number).

Contract award(s) shall be made to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer(s), in conforming to this RFP, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-16. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-32971 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  BACKGROUND:  Under the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's (FCIC) Actual Production History (APH) rating model, a unit's rate is a function of its location, the crop, the crop type, the applied cropping practice, the coverage level, and the unit's approved yield relative to the associated reference yield.  The USDA Risk management Agency (RMA) attempts to match the appropriate premium to the risk associated for a given yield within a county.  RMA currently does this by using type and practice factors and through the application of an exponential parameter.  The exponential parameter is a measure of elasticity.  The yield elasticity of premium rate shows how the premium rate responds to a change in yield.  The type and practice factor shifts the county rate, prior to the application of the exponential parameter when determining a unit's rate.  The multitude of variables, along with RMA's current actuarial procedures, creates complexity and questions in determining the most appropriate rate for a given unit and yield. The goal of this procurement action is to review RMA's APH rating model and provide recommendations in the form of a mathematical description to ensure actuarially sound procedures and calculations in determining and applying exponential parameter and type/practice factor estimates. The Government anticipates that this will be a firm fixed price award, and reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Government cost estimate for this project is based on approximately 1560 professional labor hours of effort.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation (INL/A) is soliciting offerors to provide aviation support services.  

INL/A is primarily responsible for supporting the U.S. Embassy Country Teams, generally through the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of each embassy, in their effort to assist host nation governments in the eradication and interdiction of illicit crops such as marijuana, coca and opium poppy as mandated in the Foreign Assistance Act.  Secondary missions include pipeline security, border patrol, and other related activities.  The missions are accomplished via the use of fixed wing and rotary aircraft, and are performed in overseas nations in an environment that at times may be extremely hostile and somewhat austere.  These operations are currently performed in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and Pakistan, and are anticipated in Mexico and Afghanistan in the near future.  
The contract will provide all necessary operations and support of this INL/A mission for an initial transition period of up to six months, and a performance period that could extend to 10 years provided the contractor meets performance incentives provided in the associated award term provision.  The anticipated annual contract value is approximately $170M, but could vary greatly depending upon how the mission evolves over the performance period.

Specific program objectives include: 1. Illicit crop eradication: The contractor will be responsible for both aerial eradication and support for host nation manual eradication of illicit drug crops in designated countries, as well as the interdiction of illicit drug production and trafficking.  The contractor will be wholly responsible for aerial eradication, while providing aviation services in support of host nation personnel for the manual eradication and interdiction missions. 2. Aircraft availability:  The contractor will provide all necessary logistics and maintenance services to ensure that aircraft are available to perform the many varied tasks as required by local U. S. Embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) officials.  The goal is to provide a lean logistics support system that uses state-of-the-art business practices and streamlined processes that minimize infrastructure requirements in all fields of operation. 3. Training:  While host nation personnel should be qualified to perform the required missions, the contractor is responsible for identifying deficiencies and working with the US Government and host nation representatives to develop training programs to rectify any shortfalls.  The ultimate goal is to transition all specified mission requirements to host nation personnel at the earliest date possible. 4. Flexibility:  Due to the evolving nature of the mission, the contractor must be able to react to changing conditions quickly, with minimal impact to steady state operations.

Contract Objectives: All requirements of the Technical Requirements Document must be met. The government is interested in a best value approach that can provide all necessary services efficiently and safely.  While there are inherent dangers in counter narcotics activities, every effort should be made to ensure that operations are conducted in accordance with proven industry and/or government standards.
