<ARCHDATE>02212008
<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Pacific Northwest Regional Office of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation intends to award three or more indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for professional surveying services for surveying in the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington (one or more for each state).  We currently have four ID/IQ contracts in place: one each for Oregon and Washington and two for Idaho.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyors licensed in the states of interest where work will be conducted will be considered.  The work will mainly involve surveying assistance on an intermittent, as-needed basis in support of Reclamation efforts to improve salmon/steelhead habitat as well as in support of other Reclamation activities.  Services may be sought on a short turnaround basis (e.g., response within a week or two of a Task Order placed under the contract) and will typically be required at river/stream diversion structures and related facilities such as dams, weirs, canals, and fish screens.  Required services may include: assessing site topography (topographic information on and around barriers, abutments, etc.); preparing sections (on/upstream/downstream of barriers with notes on water elevations, substrate type, etc.); providing structure details (elevations and dimensions on and around barriers, headworks, culverts, etc.); collecting information on miscellaneous features (ground surface topography, trees, fence lines, power and other utilities, bridges, access conditions, etc.); as well as recorded legal boundary surveys and production of surveys, maps and drawings showing true elevations and survey control. Other potential services may involve aerial surveys and photogrammetry; bathymetry; or 3D laser scanning;   The Contractor(s) shall produce Field Book Data Files and Digital Terrain Models representing true elevations and survey control compatible with Autodesk Land Desktop 2007 and/or Civil 3D 2007, configured with the Pacific Northwest Region=s (PN) standards and using PN=s standard operating procedures as provided by the Contracting Officer, or other surveying software that can be converted to the format needed for Autodesk Land Desktop 2007 and/or Civil 3D 2007.  The Contractor must demonstrate that the data can be successfully converted to Autodesk Land Desktop 2007 and/or Civil 3D 2007 format prior to using other surveying software.  Currently identified geographic areas in which surveying is needed include West Central Idaho and South Central Idaho, various river basins and subbasins in both Oregon and Washington, and on existing Reclamation facilities and lands in all three states. The quantity and timing of survey work may be adjusted by the Government based on changes in priority workload and funding availability. TOs for surveys are not limited to the areas listed. It is Reclamation=s intent to award multiple ID/IQ contracts for surveys, one or two for each of the three States.  Offerors may propose on a single State, more than one State, or on portions of States. Each contract may be issued as a 1 year contract with four 1 year extension option (a potential contract duration of 5 years). General land based surveying services will be required in all states and 3D laser scanning services or aerial surveying services may also be required. Estimated contract time will vary with each individual task order.  The Government currently estimates that we will require 1 to 20 surveys per State per year.  Reclamation reserves the right to award multiple contracts per geographic area or State. Firms qualified and interested in providing professional surveying services of the types listed above are hereby invited to submit: Standard Form 330 (SF 330), "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part I and SF 330 Part II. An Adobe Acrobat version of the SF 330 form is available at www.gsa.gov.  Please enter the geographic area(s) or State(s) for which you wish to provide surveying services in Block #1 of the SF 330.  In evaluating responses, the following evaluation criteria will be applied, with evaluation criterias1, 2, and 3 being roughly equal to one another and, when combined, these three criteria are less important then combined criteria 4 and 5 which are also roughly equivalent to one another: (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Include your firm's Registered Professional Surveyors' experience in similar surveys for the state your firm proposes to perform surveys in.  In your SF-330, state the amount of time, expressed as a percent, that the responsible (licensed) land surveyor will work on survey projects. (2) Specialized experience, expertise, and technical competence in the type of work required for the specific geographic areas your firm is proposing to perform services in.  List years of experience in similar surveys for the key personnel that will be assigned to the projects. Include an outline of field and office procedures, including a self inspection plan.  (3) Capacity of the firm to provide the required services in the required time frames.  List your firm's equipment, personnel availability, and management and quality control procedures used to ensure reasonable deadlines are met and quality deliverables are produced.  Include any proposed subcontractor(s) (including their SF330s) and specify what duties they would perform (for example, specialties like aerial surveys or laser scanning).  Firms with the capability of producing required data using Autodesk Land Desktop 2007 and/or Civil 3D 2007 software (configured with the PN Region=s standards and using PN=s standard operating procedures) will receive higher ratings. Other systems will be acceptable if the Contractor can demonstrate that the data can be successfully converted toAutodesk Land Desktop 2007 and/or Civil 3D 2007 format.  (4) Recent, relevant, successful past performance on similar A-E surveying contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Please provide only references for projects that are similar in scope and magnitude to the required services.  (5) Proximity of the firm to local project areas for which they wish to be considered and demonstrated knowledge and expertise in performing surveys in those localities. Indicate how you plan to provide service in a cost effective manner.  Indicate your firm's knowledge of local survey practices for the localities you propose to perform surveys in.  Submit a sample map and drawing showing topographic survey data and sections and plan and profile views for river/stream environments.  When preparing your submission, BE SURE TO CONSIDER ALL FIVE EVALUATION CRITERIA. Additional sheets may be used to address all evaluation criteria relative to the required services.  Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, discussions will occur with firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services for each of the three states.  Negotiations will occur beginning with the most preferred firm(s) in the final selection.  If a mutually agreeable contract can be reached, then award will be made.  If not, then negotiations with that firm will be terminated and the next most preferred firm would be contacted for negotiation.  Please submit three copies of the above information to: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, 1150 N. Curtis Road, Boise ID 83706-1234, ATTN: PN-3715, Contracting Officer; include Solicitation No. 07SP101654 on the outside of the package.  To be considered, all material must be received by 4 PM local time in Boise ID on April 13, 2007. The small business size standard for this acquisition is $4.5 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods. The NAICS code is 541370 and the SIC code is 8713.  This requirement is NOT a set-aside. See Numbered Note 24.

<DESC>1.0 SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for customer service centers, located outside the continental United States to support non-immigrant visa operations at United States consulates and embassies abroad.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on March 21, 2007.  See section 8.0 for further information.


2.0 DESCRIPTION

The Bureau of Consular Affairs, of the United States Department of State, is seeking information from industry that will assist in our consideration of a possible procurement of services where under the contractor would provide customer services for applicants for non-immigrant visas at locations overseas.  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Feasibility of the creation of customer service centers; 
?	that provide information about visa application processes,
?	that provide data entry support (to include 10-fingerscan and live digital photo capture) to consulates and embassies for large numbers of visa applicants,
?	to provide or arrange for courier services to return documents to visa applicants,
?	to collect visa fees on behalf of the United States Government and deposit said fees, and
?	to provide appointments for interviews as required.

Potential cost of service information per client based on a given set of parameters;

Quality assurance and risk mitigation strategies to prevent fraud, employee malfeasance and loss; 

Proposed business process that provides efficient, quality services to a diverse client base that complies with all requirements.

3.0 REQUIREMENTS

This section outlines the functional requirements for a customer service center.  For purposes of responding to the RFI, requirements in the form of hypothetical locations to be served and additional technical details such as systems information and hardware requirements will be delivered to respondents at an information exchange meeting to be scheduled at a later date (see Section 6.0, below). 

Customer service centers are intended to provide information, service support and data collection activities at sites that are convenient for applicants for non-immigrant visas but are not located on United States Government Property.  As increased demand for non-immigrant visas creates infrastructure challenges for existing embassies and consulates, these centers must accommodate high numbers of customers without support from the U.S. Government.  Ideally, the location of these centers would allow for easy and secure access by the public in an environment that does not detract from the image of the U.S. Government.

In the case of this RFI, assume an initial site or sites located in Monterrey, Mexico and/or major population centers in the region.  After establishment and evaluation, upon approval by the Department of State, the contractor could expand the service to approved cities supporting selected consular sections worldwide.  

The contractor, either directly, or through approved sub-contractors will provide the following services: 

?	Provision of visa process information via full-service call center;
?	Visa Interview and Biometric Collection Appointment Scheduling;
?	Machine Readable Visa (MRV) Fee Collection;
?	Data entry or verification services for visa application forms in Department of State software;
?	Initial collection of biometric data (10 fingerprint scanning) of applicants between 14 and 80 years of age;
?	Live capture digital photograph of all visa applicants;
?	Arrangement and payment for courier services for return of documents following visa interview appointment.

The potential for adding video communications also exists as a secondary requirement at this time.  Video services to be supported will include, but not be limited to, conferencing and multicast/broadcast. These services can be added on an as-needed basis after the establishment of the facility and will not be necessary at all facilities. 

Must be able to provision and maintain an IT infrastructure and high-speed internet access. (Specification pending from CST).  Estimated throughput will be based on moving 500kb files from contractor site to State Department servers.  Estimate 250,000 files per year.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.


4.0 POSSIBLE SERVICE CENTER SCHEMA

Customer Service Centers run by the contractor in selected cities are operated to serve as a one-stop facility for visa applicants to get information related to visas and to submit their online application.  The interview will be conducted, and the application will be adjudicated by U.S. consular officers at a nearby consular section.  Located in key population centers servicing a consular section, the service center requires applicants to come in person for collection of biometric data by the contractor.  

The applicant first makes contact with the contractor through one of several means, as published on the consular section website (this could be a call center, online appointment system, or other technique, to be determined).  For the purposes of this RFI, assume use of the existing call center in Mexico, provided under CA?s user pays umbrella contract with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  Applicants will be scheduled for an appearance at the customer service center (in connection with making a visa interview appointment), at least 24 hours prior to their visa appointment.  We would expect the customer service centers to be open at hours that allow for convenient access for applicants, including some evening hours and weekends.

Currently, all applicants are required to enter their application information on a form available through the consular section?s website.  The form, which allows for data entry to our database, returns a hardcopy application with a barcode when the applicant prints it out.  When the applicant arrives at the customer service center, an employee can scan the barcode in a web-enabled application, which will bring up the applicant?s form.  The contractor will verify data accuracy with the applicant?s passport and the applicant. The employee then scans the applicant?s fingerprints, takes a digital photo, with all images captured in the application.  Upon completion of these steps, the employee transmits, via the web-enabled application, the form, which goes to the supported consular section.  The digital fingerscans and photos are large files; the contractor must ensure that bandwidth and line speed will allow them to transmit these large files over the internet at sufficient speed to handle applicant volume.  If a client has not filled out the appropriate on-line forms, a terminal should be provided for them to do so at the customer service center, or a customer service employee can complete this task for them.  In some cases, the contractor may be required to courier applicant?s passports to the consulate in advance of the interview.

The contractor will host a payment facility of the bank that currently has a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City to collect on behalf of the United States Government (USG) appropriate, State Department-approved fees for the application process.  This fee will generally consist of a $100 MRV processing fee (subject to change), which must be deposited into a U.S. Government account on a daily basis, with receipts going to the official cashier at the supported consular section. 

The applicant also arranges with the contractor to receive the visa or border crossing card by courier or on the premises of the contractor in the event that the application is approved.  Upon completion of the process, the contractor provides a receipt with the interview appointment date, receipt of fee and bar code printed on it.  The applicant must take this receipt to the consulate for his or her appointment as it also serves as the ticket for entry.

4.1 Fees

The Bureau of Consular Affairs has not established the nature of fees for this initiative, specifically whether there will be a user pays fee paid by the applicant separate from the MRV fee or whether the Department of State will cover the costs. Regardless, we make the following assumptions:

The contractor should calculate the cost to the USG (in other words, what the contractor expects to charge) on a per-application basis for the requirements stated above.  The method of contracting has yet to be determined, but the contractor?s estimate of costs is important to this RFI.  We would appreciate an estimate for a customer service center processing 255,000 applicants per year to support the proposed pilot post, Monterrey.  Costs should be broken down by step of the process, such as:

?	Making the appointment by a proposed means;
?	Collecting biometric data;
?	Taking the digital photograph (directly into the web application);
?	Hosting a banking collection facility;
?	Courier service from Consular section to applicant?s residence, or designated contractor pickup point.

While current high-volume posts average about 5 minutes to scan and verify data, you may calculate the amount of time required to service each client to be 7 minutes, give or take a minute.  This time includes checking the application for completeness, scanning fingerprints, and taking the photograph.  Making courier arrangements, data entry of applications (which might be required in the event that an applicant has no access to the internet), and cashier payment is not included in the 7-minute figure. 

At this time, for the sake of this RFI, assume that peripheral equipment (fingerprint scanners and digital cameras) will be provided by the Department of State, as will any specialized software.  Contractors will supply computers, internet software (e.g., Internet Explorer), printers, and high speed internet connectivity.  In addition to providing a facility, the customer service center will have to outfit its own furniture, servers, and PC?s.

5.0 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 ? Conceptual Approach 

Briefly describe how the contractor might satisfy requirements above, including any recommended alternatives to the proposed process.  

Section 2 ? Feasibility Assessment

Section 3 ? Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for the proposed process on a per application basis for the provided estimates in section 4.1 above.

Section 4 ? Risk Mitigation

Describe the proposed strategies to prevent fraud, employee malfeasance and loss.  This section should describe security precautions taken with applicant?s personal documents (passport, visa, Border Crossing Card), as well as cash collection and transfer precautions.  Security of sites of the customer service centers should be addressed.

Section 5 ? Corporate Expertise

It requires fair and accurate presentation of achievement data and permits the collection of background or descriptive information that is related to academic achievement and aids in reporting of results. The intent of the law is to provide representative-sample data on student achievement for the nation, the states, and subpopulations of students and to monitor progress over time.  Under this procurement, the Department intends to make seven separate prime contract awards to up to four organizations.  The approximate date of release of the RFP is March 8, 2007, and the approximate date of closing is April 23, 2007.  Contract awards are tentatively scheduled to be announced in August 2007.

The General Services Administration (GSA) Rocky Mountain Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the replacement and modernization of the Denver Federal Center Utility Infrastructure in Denver, Colorado.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of CMc Pre-Construction/Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  The Federal Government is the second largest employer in the Lakewood community.  Community and visitor attractions include, National Archives, Child Care and Infant Toddler Center, Wellness Center, GSA Property Sales, Credit Unions, Training Centers, USGS Map Sales, Technology Information Center and BOR School Tours. 

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
Selection of the CMc ? type firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations, source selection procedures and the ?Best Value Trade-Off? process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation. As part of the CMc Pre-Construction Phase, the CMc shall work with the A E and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-Construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: preliminary evaluation of design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, resolving problems, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews and performing administrative and other services as defined in this scope of work, in addition to other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional multi-system utility infrastructure.

The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting VE exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the multi-system utility infrastructure, pump station, and water storage facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional multi-system utility infrastructure.  At the time of the CMc contract award, which is projected to coincide with the Design Development Phase, project development shall occur in general conformance with the process described in the American Institute of Architects Document A121/CMc (also known as AGS Document 565) and ?Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Construction Manager Where The Construction Manager Is Also The Constructor?.

<SUBJECT>R--List 1 Methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529) - Analytical Services Supporting the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Program
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-06-10768
<CONTACT>DAVID H. PLAGGE, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2022, E-Mail: plagge.david@epa.gov
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center (TSC) requires contractor support for analytical laboratory services in conjunction with implementation of the second cycle of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR2). The EPA has the responsibility to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrence in order to characterize drinking water threats. While EPA relies on independent research efforts, it also is heavily engaged in conducting drinking water occurrence studies to obtain new data. The largest of these studies is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR. The UCMR is a 5-year cyclic monitoring program, which allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water. The anticipated strategy is to select the key contaminants identified as occurrence priorities, which when combined with health effects data and available drinking water treatment technologies, enable EPA to establish National Primary Drinking Water Standards and maximize the protection of public health.  As a means to reduce the UCMR compliance burden on small public water systems (those serving less than 10,000 individuals), EPA selected a representative sample of 800 small systems that must comply with the UCMR monitoring requirements for List 1 contaminants.  This procurement will specifically serve as the means for conducting these sample analyses relative to EPA Laboratory Approval for the List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529). Successful offerors to PR-CI-06-10768 shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities to support the tasked analytical services included in the Performance Work Statement.  Tasks under this solicitation will include:  1)	Conducting laboratory analyses, following all required QC using methods promulgated for UCMR2.  An interested small business laboratory will need to have EPA Laboratory Approval for the List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529). 2)	Providing logistical support by logging, receiving, confirming appropriate preservation, and storing field samples received at their laboratory in support of this contract. 3)	Reporting results in a timely manner using an EPA specified electronic format. 4)	Preparing monthly reports identifying any problems encountered as well as the status of work completed and on-going analyses. Under an existing contract vehicle, EPA will coordinate the preparation of these kits and the collection of these samples.  To reiterate, laboratories will not be responsible for sample shipping costs, unless these shipping costs are the direct result of chronic sample recollections due to gross laboratory negligence or incompetence. To ensure sufficient laboratory capacity, it is anticipated that multiple contracts will be established under this requirement as indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contracts.   It is anticipated that three contracts may be awarded under this solicitation.  The contract will be fixed rate for each Method Analysis.  The anticipated contracts will have an ordering period of five years. Over the five year multiple award ordering period, EPA estimates a sum total (adding all methods individually and multiplying by the number of applicable Public Water Systems and anticipated sampling locations per PWS) of approximately 19,000 sample analyses will be ordered.  The approximate total is comprised of an estimated 9,500 analyses for EPA Method 527 and 9,500 analyses for Method 529.  The vast majority of these analyses will be conducted during the three year monitoring period for UCMR2 (extending from January 2008 through December 2010). Firms interested in this requirement need to recognize that it will need to have EPA-approval for List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529).  To attain EPA approval, UCMR2 laboratory application(s) must be complete without unresolved deficiencies and firms must have passed an EPA offered proficiency testing (PT) study for each of the respective methods.   The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million. The projected start date of the contract is August 1, 2007. The solicitation is expected to be posted to the internet on or about March 21, 2007, as Solicitation Number PR-CI-06-10768 and may be accessed through the direct link URL: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided. It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note: 1

This will include Blue Force Tracking beacon capability, improvements that will allow cabin passengers to keep their personal GPS devices updated, and providing a cabin situational awareness device that is a derivative of the V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS).  The VISAS was designed and developed by RTSC, and includes a moving map display of aircraft position, as well as the display of other situational awareness data.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The estimated period of performance is to start 15 February 2007 through 30 November 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 15 February 2007.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.*****

<CONTACT>Charles Peck, Contract Specialist, Phone 302-677-3744, Fax 302-677-2309, Email charles.peck@dover.af.mil
<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base period for one unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length. The requirement is to repair and refurbish one empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition as per original design specifications.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source. 

The NAICS code is 332312 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) 500 Employees.

Evaluation for award will be Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPTO). Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 27 Mar 2007 and will close on or about 9 May 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure  Precipitation Static Test Sets with the capability of pinpointing airframe bonding issues on the P-3, E-6, and EA-6B aircraft platforms. The current P-STAT Test Sets are used by the Navy for pin-pointing the areas prone to P-Static problems such as:  Fin Caps, Tail Cones, Structural Plates, Antenna Mounting, Inspection Panels, Bonding Straps, Radomes, etc.

The objectives for this procurement are to provide the Navy with portable, ruggedized, lightweight P-STAT Test Sets while satisfying aircraft maintenance needs with a modified commercial variant of the current P-STAT Test Set. The new P-STAT Test Set shall be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified COTS item.

The P-STAT Test Set shall be capable of inducing a localized, high voltage static charge onto the outer skin of the aircraft to simulate actual atmospheric precipitation conditions that occur during aircraft flight. The Test Set shall also be capable of inducing three types of electrical discharge generated by problem areas on the aircraft: Metal-to-Metal Arcing/Sparking, Corona Discharge, and Streamering Effects. The Test Set shall be capable of charging windshields, radomes, and other non-metal surfaces, as well as charging isolated metal sections. Based on the high voltage produced by the P-STAT Test Set, risk of shock or electrocution is a primary concern. The procurement of a common piece of support equipment will allow for configuration control and common operation practices, as well as logistics support.  

The Government intends to procure up to a maximum of (50) P-STAT Test Sets over the life of the contract. The first (3) P-STAT Test Sets shall be pilot production units procured under the first delivery order under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract along with associated technical and logistics data and training. Delivery of the (3) pilot production units and associated technical and logistics data and training will take place within 330 days after date of delivery order award. The pilot production units shall be used for pilot production testing and supportability evaluation/approval testing. Upon completion of contractor pilot production testing and Government suitability/supportability evaluation, up to a maximum of (47) production units may be procured under one or more delivery orders. Delivery of the production units and associated technical and logistics data will take place within 6 months after date of delivery order award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm-fixed price effort.

The contractor shall organize, coordinate, and control all program activities to ensure compliance with the contract requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services. The contractor shall provide necessary system engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the SOW and the Performance Specification.  The FSC Code for this requirement is 6625.

The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website located at http://www.navair.navy.mil on or about 08 MARCH 2007. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The point of contact is: James W. Maxwell, phone: (732) 323-4589, FAX: (732) 323-2359, email: james.w.maxwell@navy.mil.

Contracting questions should be directed to: Mrs. Kim Miles, kmiles@cpsc.gov. RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION: Mechanical Modeling of All-Terrain Vehicles and Biomechanical Modeling of Youth Drivers. The CPSC is concerned about the hazards posed to youth under 16 years of age riding all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Incidents related to ATVs can result in death or serious injuries and/or lasting disabilities to youth. CPSC staff has studied ATVs for many years, most recently in responding to a 2002 petition requesting a ban on the sale of adult four-wheeled ATVs sold for use by children and in developing a briefing package recommending that the Commission approve a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would set mechanical, labeling, point of sale, instruction, and training requirements for ATVs. The NPR was subsequently approved by the Commission and published in the August 10, 2006, Federal Register. In 2001, there were an estimated 2.8 million ATV drivers under the age of 16, and another 4.4 million children rode ATVs as passengers. Children under 16 sustained about 31% of the estimated ATV-related injuries in 2001, and the societal costs associated with all medically attended injuries to children under 16 that year are estimated to be $2.5 billion. The societal costs of ATV-related deaths to children in 2001 are estimated to have amounted to about $550 million. Eighty-nine percent of child drivers who were injured were driving an adult ATV at the time. Based on injury and exposure data estimated from surveys conducted in 2001, the risk of injury to drivers under the age of 16 on adult ATVs was roughly twice the risk for child drivers on youth ATVs. The CPSC staff is considering various means to try to reduce youth deaths and injuries related to ATVs. Since the risk to youth on adult ATVs is much higher than on youth ATVs, CPSC encourages all youth to ride appropriate youth ATVs. However, CPSC staff is aware that current youth models may not fit youth physically. For more background information on this issue, please see the staff briefing packages and other documents available on the CPSC Web site (go to http://www.cpsc.gov/cgi-bin/foia.aspx, select "All Terrain Vehicles", and click on "Find"). The relevant documents with human factors information are in the Web site listing as follows (by date, beginning with the most recent): (1) CPSC Staff Response Regarding Follow-Up Questions from Commissioner Moore after ATV Safety Review Briefing, dated 07/11/2006: Youth ATVs - Questions 1 through 6 (beginning on p. 3 of 18) and Question 9 (beginning on p. 7 of 18); (2) CPSC Staff Response to Commissioner Nancy Nord after the June 15, 2006, ATV Safety Review Briefing, dated 06/30/2006: Question 3 (beginning on p. 3 of 7); (3) All Terrain Vehicle Initiative, Part 2, dated 05/31/2006, especially Tab H (p. 138 of 229 through p. 149 of 229), (4) Response to Questions from Commissioner Moore on CP-02-4/HP-02-1, Petition Requesting Ban of All-Terrain Vehicles Sold for Use by Children under Age 16, dated 08/22/2005: Question 8 (beginning on p. 3 of 6); (5) Analysis of Petition CP-02-3/HP-02-1 - Requesting Ban of ATVs Sold for the Use of Children Under Age 16 - Part 3, dated 02/02/2005, especially Tab H (p. 9 of 55 through p. 55 of 55); and (6) Analysis of Petition CP-02-3/HP-02-1 - Requesting Ban of ATVs Sold for the Use of Children Under Age 16 - Part 4, dated 02/02/2005, especially Tab I (p. 1 of 43 through p. 6 of 43). One of the strategies being proposed by the Commission to encourage youth to select appropriate ATVs is to characterize youth ATVs by speed rather than engine size, as is currently done. (A chart showing the CPSC proposed ATV models and intended ages is available on p. 45908 of the August 10, 2006, Federal Register notice.)  While this may provide youth with a viable and appealing youth-specific alternative to a larger, heavier, faster adult ATV, concerns have been raised that this might allow the availability of youth ATVs that would be too heavy for youth and that would cause a crushing hazard. The question has arisen as to whether there is an appropriate or suitable youth ATV weight and/or ratio of ATV weight to driver weight for youth ATVs. REQUEST: CPSC staff has identified several important factors that would need to be considered regarding a suitable weight or weight ratio for youth ATVs. First, the ATV should be sufficiently heavy to reduce the effect a heavy youth would have on the systems center of gravity. Second, ideally the weight of the ATV should not pose a serious crushing hazard to the child if the ATV were to roll over onto the child. Ideally, the child should be able to right the ATV should it roll over. Lastly, the child must be strong enough to physically control the ATV; however, control depends on many factors other than simply strength, such as speed, terrain, rear differential type, and other ATV design factors. To this point, staff has not been able to quantify a relationship between the varying factors. CPSC staff realizes that, while the ideal of eliminating all hazards associated with ATV driving is not feasible, it may be possible to reduce the number of deaths and the severity of injuries, especially to youth. CPSC staff is interested in obtaining ideas, data, concepts, and feasibility information related to modeling and simulating the interplay among the factors mentioned above. The information sought would indicate the potential of methods that may eventually allow staff to develop recommendations for ATV weight based on the age and/or weight of the youth. CPSC staff therefore would like to consider the feasibility of research specifically targeted at creating a model representing ATV behavior and simulating the interaction between ATV behavior, ATV characteristics, and the youth driver, over representative models of off-road terrain. GENERAL QUESTIONS: Responders should provide documentation of the potential options available to model the relationship between youth drivers and their ATVs. CPSC staff is particularly interested in the feasibility of developing/using models that: 1) quantify muscle forces required to successfully control an ATV at various speeds and on various off-road terrains, 2) provide flexibility to represent different size and weight ATVs and different size and weight youth, and 3) represent youth driving ATVs. Responders should also address the following questions in their submissions: 1) What are the possible methods that could be employed to create the desired model? 2) What are some examples of similar models? 3) Are there existing finite element models of ATVs and/or what data is needed to create one? 4) Is there another method that could be employed to determine the optimal youth-ATV weight relationship? 5) What other factors influence the optimum weight? 6) Is there a software solution that could be used by CPSC staff with minimal training? 7) What is a reasonable rough estimate of the time, cost, and other resources needed to create such a model and simulation? HOW TO RESPOND: Responses should be in the form of reports or letters discussing the likely success of research projects aimed at acquiring the data listed above, and including factual support for observations made therein. If the responder provides a compilation of published example studies from other sources, the results should be summarized. If examples of animated simulations are included, they should be readable by a DVD player or a Windows-based computer. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are to be submitted directly to the Contracting Office address indicated above, Attn: Mrs. Kim Miles no later than March 30, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SUMMARY OF CHANGES SECTION  SF 30 - BLOCK 14 CONTINUATION PAGE  The following have been added by full text:          AMENDMENT 0003 1. Measure of CLMs received in a normal month: Looking at the last 3 months of 2006 and measured the number of cars, loaded and empty by calendar month: December  3,531 November  4,310 October   5,392 The average of the 3 months is 4,411.  Taking an average of 25 CLMs per movement would provide an average of 110,275 CLMs per month. The question about the range of CLMs received in a normal month, using the high and low above, would reflect a range that falls between 88,275 CLMs and 134,800 CLMSs per month(taking the high and low CLM numbers above on the 3 months X 25). 2. Total Number of historical records in the database. This information is requested for the inquiry on transit time and historical utilization report. SDDC estimates that there are approximately 4,000,000 records in the data base.   3.  How many records can be provided with clarifying information as to whether the records are for one or more of the following factors affecting transit time (from 4.4.3.8):  high/wide or normal clearances, unit train or manifest service, by day of week, by season, and by railroad.  SDDC experience is that less than half of the CLMs are contained in this information.  It is difficult for the agency to provide an accurate estimate of how many shipments are affected.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service intends to procure construction of an Upper Air Inflation Shelter (UAIS) at Yakutat, Alaska. 

Yakutat is isolated among the lowlands along the Gulf of Alaska, 212 miles northwest of Juneau and 225 miles southeast of Cordova at the mouth of Yakutat Bay.  This project involves the construction of an approximately 500 square foot Upper Air Inflation Shelter (UAIS) facility on approximately one (1) acre of Government leased land on the Yakutat Airport.

The single story structure, constructed mostly of wood with metal skin & roofing materials, will be used by employees of the U.S. National Weather Service for the filling, launching and tracking of critical weather data collecting balloons 2 times each day, 365 days per year.  In addition to the UAIS, certain ancillary site features will be constructed under this Contract such as: dirt excavation and structural fill; grade land to provide positive drainage away from the UAIS and parking area; extending buried electrical power lines to the new UAIS; a helium trailer parking area enclosed with a chain link fence; a gravel access road and parking area; piling supports, buried electrical line and empty conduit for an upper air tracking tower (tower to be installed by others) approximately 180 feet from the UAIS.

The Project shall allow for either stick built or pre-engineered construction, and has been designed to all applicable design codes including Seismic loading.

D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Departments specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant.  In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturers product at this stage in the programs life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Departments requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers.    As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

<DESC>The following questions were posed answers below are as follows:

Please refer to original solicitation notice for info on this requirment...............................

QUESTION 1 - 
a)  Sheet 1 makes reference to "Blade Palm" etc. implying removable blades whereas props are fixed pitch with ntegral blades as shown on Sheet 2.  Please clarify.

This is a monobloc four (04) blade propeller.  

b)  Exterior surface, Note 4 requires 63 micro inch surface finish whereas, specification states 125 micro inches. Please clarify.

The hub finish shall not exceed 125 microinches.  The blade finish shall not exceed 63 microinches.  The specification will be modified to reflect this change.

c)  Blade root fillet, Note 5:  What are fillet dimensional requirements?

Blade root fillet contours shall be fair in both the radial and circumferential directions.  The minimum fillet radius shall not be less than 1.5 inch.  

d)  Markings, Note 6:  Since this is fixed pitch propeller we assume only one set of markings is required.  Please clarify.

Each manufactured propeller shall be stamped in accordance with the specification.  Markings shall be placed on the hub outside diameter near the aft end and clear of the blade fillets.

e)  Balance, Note 13:  We assume "practicable" (i.e. as meaning possible) should instead be "practical".  Please confirm.

The word "practical" can be used.

f)  Balance, Note 15:  Seems like a word or two was not included in sentence.  Please clarify.

The sentence should read as follows:  "There shall be no machining of the propeller after final balance check".

2.  NC Machining: Specification as written requires NC machining all over.  This may not be possible in the areas of blade fillet and inner radii due to fixed pitch aspect and possible space constraints on equipment and cutters.  Please clarify.

QUESTION 2 - The propeller may be hand finished in all areas where CNC machining capabilities are restricted as long as dimensional requirements, where specified, are maintained.  However, it should be noted that this propeller type was successfully manufactured by CNC machining process on a past procurement without significant problems, though the exact amount of hand finishing was not revealed.

3.  Delivery:  We note that Pre-solicitation Notice states delivery on or before 8/01/07 and (assuming award is 10 days after bid submittal date of Feb. 23, i.e. March 4) thereby leaving some 149 days to produce and delivery. Whereas; when summing up the allotted days per the delivery schedule this number of 149 days can only be achieved by assuming final approvals after the stated review days for the various CLIN?s with no allowance for re-submittal. Please clarify.

Add 30 days to the current projected delivery date: 09/01/07.

4.  NAVSEA Certification:  Delivery list description for CLIN 0001 states info to be ?certified by NAVSEA? whereas Section 3.7 of the specification lists other criteria.  Please clarify and advise procedure for NAVSEA certification if required.

The reference cited in section 3.7 of the ELC specification, NAVSEA Technical Publication S9074-AQ-GIB-010/248, REQUIREMENTS FOR WELDING AND BRAZING PROCEDURE AND PERFORMANCE QUALIFICATION shall be the primary document for determining welding certification requirements. It actually works hand in hand with DOD-STD-2185, REQUIREMENTS FOR REPAIR AND STRAIGHTENING OF BRONZE NAVAL SHIP PROPELLERS.  To summarize ELC specification requirements for welding, the vendor will need to provide (1) written welding procedures that contain essential elements outlined in Table V of S9074-AQ-GIB-010/248 for each type of welding that may be required to repair a casting of nickel aluminum bronze using an approved filler metal, (2) a welding procedure qualification test report for each welding procedure submitted, and (3) a welder qualification record that validates those welder(s) qualified to perform the welding procedure outlined.  If the vendor already has welding procedures/qualifications that were prepared for other government agencies, ABS, or ASME, they may be submitted to ELC for review/approval.

5. Please clarify if FAR 52.274-16 applies to this solicitation.

No this clause will not be applicable to this order.

 
6.  Bid Response Extension:
It is not possible for us to meet the response date of Feb. 23 without first having your answers to above and to other questions per our
previous e-mail.  Accordingly to allow sufficient time to receive and review your anticipated response to our questions we request a bid response extension until March 30, 2007.

No quote extension granted.  Quote is due COB 23FEB2007

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure  Precipitation Static Test Sets with the capability of pinpointing airframe bonding issues on the P-3, E-6, and EA-6B aircraft platforms. The current P-STAT Test Sets are used by the Navy for pin-pointing the areas prone to P-Static problems such as:  Fin Caps, Tail Cones, Structural Plates, Antenna Mounting, Inspection Panels, Bonding Straps, Radomes, etc.

The objectives for this procurement are to provide the Navy with portable, ruggedized, lightweight P-STAT Test Sets while satisfying aircraft maintenance needs with a modified commercial variant of the current P-STAT Test Set. The new P-STAT Test Set shall be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified COTS item.

The P-STAT Test Set shall be capable of inducing a localized, high voltage static charge onto the outer skin of the aircraft to simulate actual atmospheric precipitation conditions that occur during aircraft flight. The Test Set shall also be capable of inducing three types of electrical discharge generated by problem areas on the aircraft: Metal-to-Metal Arcing/Sparking, Corona Discharge, and Streamering Effects. The Test Set shall be capable of charging windshields, radomes, and other non-metal surfaces, as well as charging isolated metal sections. Based on the high voltage produced by the P-STAT Test Set, risk of shock or electrocution is a primary concern. The procurement of a common piece of support equipment will allow for configuration control and common operation practices, as well as logistics support.  

The Government intends to procure up to a maximum of (50) P-STAT Test Sets over the life of the contract. The first (3) P-STAT Test Sets shall be pilot production units procured under the first delivery order under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract along with associated technical and logistics data and training. Delivery of the (3) pilot production units and associated technical and logistics data and training will take place within 330 days after date of delivery order award. The pilot production units shall be used for pilot production testing and supportability evaluation/approval testing. Upon completion of contractor pilot production testing and Government suitability/supportability evaluation, up to a maximum of (47) production units may be procured under one or more delivery orders. Delivery of the production units and associated technical and logistics data will take place within 6 months after date of delivery order award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm-fixed price effort.

The contractor shall organize, coordinate, and control all program activities to ensure compliance with the contract requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services. The contractor shall provide necessary system engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the SOW and the Performance Specification.

<DESC>Amendment 01: The purpose of this notice is to correct the voltage/frequency information included in the original RFI.  The Department of State seeks to identify sources of American Size/Style appliances with the ability to accept European/African power input (220-240Volts/50 Hertz) without transformers.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
RFI:
This notice is a form of market research and serves as a Request for Information Only:

The Department of State?s European Logistic Support Office (ELSO) seeks to identify European sources of American style household appliances (Washing Machines, Dryers, Ovens, etc).  ELSO currently purchases bulk quantities of American style products, which it receives via sea freight from the United States, and subsequently sells units to American Diplomatic Posts throughout the Europe, Africa, and Asia.     

In an effort to streamline its supply chain, ELSO seeks major brand name manufacturers with operations in continental Europe that produce appliances destined for the American marketplace (120V 50Hz). Ideally, ELSO hopes to significantly reduce delivery lead times while maintaining the major-brand name quality (Maytag, GE, Whirlpool, etc) that its customers expect and demand. 

Interested parties may send information to Thomas Lemole at (LemoleTC@State.gov).  

The Department of State currently seeks information only and does not solicit any supplies or services of any kind by this notice.

This infrastructure will provide the proper redundancy and end user support in the event of an emergency if needed.  The additional procurement of these servers will allow for the expansion and future growth of the ONE system at the Department of State.  This will give the Department the opportunity to continue the growing support of the ONE program. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of HP Compaq Servers and associated Equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the HP Compaq Products as a key component of the Departments OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) and a Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) systems.  The equipment listed above is required to support the system expansion and future growth of the ONE and Blackberry programs.  The Mobile Computing infrastructure is a Compaq/Cisco environment. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The 41USC 253(1), and FAR 6.302-1 area cited as the statutory authority. A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualification or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Departments specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant.  In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturers product at this stage in the programs life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Departments requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers.    As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Departments specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant.  In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturers product at this stage in the programs life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Departments requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers.    As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>DELIVERY MUST BE 21 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF ORDER<BR><BR>

<DESC>Seeking qualified contractors to provide executive training advisory and assistance services to the Director, Orlando VA Medical Center, 5201 Raymond Street, Orlando, Florida.  Period of performance is estimated 11 months.  Please contact the VA contracting officer, David Chittenden, at (813) 972-7589 as soon as possible and not later than 28 February 2007.  Please be prepared to discuss your status as a GSA contract holder, socio-economic status such as Veteran-Owned, or 8(a) Program contractors.  Based upon response to this notice the VA will determine the method of contracting for this service, such as issuance of a GSA Task Order, or open market set-aside in any of the various socio-economic categories (SDVOSB, 8(a), etc.).   Background:  A requirement exists in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Veterans Health Administration VISN 8 for a contractor to perform executive training advisory and assistance services for the Director, Orlando VA Medical Center.  This requirement is critical to the success of the VA because the Orlando facility was elevated from VA Outpatient Clinic status to that of an independent VA Medical Center effective October 1, 2006.  With this change in status, functions previously handled by the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Tampa and the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (Gainesville and Lake City) are being transferred to the Orlando VA Medical Center.  Additionally, a site selection process is underway that will determine the location for the construction of a new VA medical center in Orlando.  The Director will oversee the activation process of this new facility.  Objectives and deliverables:  The objective of this service is an individual development plan (IDP) for the Director.  The IDP will serve as a road map for the performance of the contract or task order.  The contractor will provide advisory assistance regarding ad-hoc management and ethical dilemmas that may arise.  Generally, meetings will be conducted in concert with the VAs Monthly Orlando Steering Committee meetings.  At the conclusion of the contract or task order, a long-term individual development plan will be completed.  The preferred methods of performance for the contract or task order include videoconferencing, teleconferencing, and e-mail.  Travel to Orlando for face-to-face interaction with the Director will be authorized as required.  Deliverables will be as follows:  1.  A Baseline Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of the initial meeting with the Director.  2.  The Baseline Assessment will consist of (1) a summary of the initial meeting, (2) an initial identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the Director, (3) a recommended reading list, and (4) an individual development plan for the Director that will incorporate a prioritized list of action items with an accompanying timeline that are to be completed during the POP.  3.  A Monthly Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of end of each month during the POP, whenever a Quarterly Assessment is not due.  4.  The Monthly Assessment will consist of (1) a summary of the activities undertaken by the contractor during that month, (2) an identification of improvements in the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the Director, (3) progress made on the recommended reading list, and (4) progress made on the individual development plan for the Director.  5.  A Quarterly Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of the end of every third month in the POP (the approximate days from the start of the POP are 90, 180, 270, and 365).  6.  The Quarterly Assessment will consist of (1) a summary of the activities undertaken during that quarter, (2) an identification of improvements in the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the Director, (3) progress made on the recommended reading list, and (4) progress made on the individual development plan for the Director.  7.  A final Assessment will be submitted within 14 calendar days of the final meeting with the Director.  8.  The Final Assessment will consist of (1) an overall summary of the activities undertaken during the POP, (2) an identification of improvements in the previously identified strengths and weaknesses of the Director with special emphasis on significant improvements and areas in which improvement is still needed, (3) progress made on the recommended reading list with an identification of a recommended recurring reading list, (4) an evaluation of the progress made on the individual development plan, (5) a new long-term individual development plan for the Director, and (6) an overall evaluation assessment of the Director.  Contractor Qualifications:  The contractor must possess adequate knowledge of and/or experience in (1) the Directors position to be assisted, (2) applicable laws, regulations, policies, rules, and systems governing and pertaining to the operation of a Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Center, and (3) the activation process of a new VA Medical Center.  Contractor qualifications that the VA considers highly desirable include extensive experience in Executive Development in VHA, experience with the High Performance Development Model, experience in advising and assisting individuals in similar positions, and knowledge of Individual Development Planning models.  Completion of background investigations will be required prior to contractor employee(s) beginning work.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking to identify potential sources that can provide applications that include, at a minimum, but not limited to, the following:  


*     Technologies to generate standard high fidelity digital elevation model (DEM) and  digital surface model (DSM) products containing small post spacing as well as post-by-post absolute uncertainty estimates (i.e., Circular and Linear Error at 90% confidence level (CE90/LE90)); 


*     Full spectrum of  advanced DEM/DSM generation technologies and advanced sources (interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR), and light detection and ranging (LIDAR)); 


*     Improved products, technologies, tools, processes, techniques, and methodologies to provide more rapid and more accurate production of DEMs/DSMs; 


*     Advanced capabilities that will support a broad range of mission applications from precision geolocation to terrain analysis/visualization including various image modalities (e.g. electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar, infrared, motion video, LIDAR etc.);


*     Visualization of DEM uncertainty information through various methods: (1) contour lines, (2) 3-dimensional shaded relief renderings, (3) image pixel overlay on 3D shaded relief and (4) rendering of 90% confidence circles on 3D shaded relief; 


*     The capability to minimize DEM artifacts and anomalies such as spikes and wells; 


*     Innovative and efficient techniques for representing and storing the DEM elevations and propagating associated errors; 


*     Fully automated DEM/DSM generation capabilities with the understanding that current technology may prohibit this without some form of human intervention;


*     Combinations of technologies to address specific requirements (e.g. automated feature extraction, image registration technologies, motion video technologies, etc.); and 


*     Robust modules that can be integrated into other systems and complete systems, from sensor to product, for producing highly accurate DEMs/DSMs.     


The primary goal is to identify DEM/DSM technologies capable of producing accurate 3-D information.  NGA seeks to produce DEM products that accurately model real-world terrain, using sensors on air-breathing and orbiting platforms and to characterize the product errors with reliable estimates of both systematic and random errors.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH.  	NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. The United States Marine Corps has a need to improve the M1A1 Tanks External Auxiliary Power Unit (EAPU).  There are three main areas that this effort intends to upgrade: increase the power output, increase the reliability, and decrease the noise signature.  The USMC desires an increase of at least 55% of the current EAPUs output power of 2 kW at 28 V DC.  Additionally, the USMC desires to increase the current mean-time-between-failure of 500 hours by at least 40%.  Finally, the USMC desires to decrease the current noise signature of 70 dB by 50%. Any improvements made to achieve the above goals should not degrade the current Auxiliary Power Units performance in the following areas.  The improved system must not be larger than the current EAPU housing (24 length x 32 width x 26 height).  It must be capable of using both diesel and JP8 fuels and provide a stand-alone electric start capability in addition to a manual (pull) start capability.  It must have oil and air filtration and fuel/water separation systems and be capable of operating between 140F and -23F.   The USMC desires the ability to mount the new Auxiliary Power Unit in the existing EAPUs armored housing, however is also interested in any system that is capable of mounting the M1A1 tanks bustle rack with a smaller footprint (5.3 square feet) and equivalent or greater armor protection. All vendors having the capability of meeting these requirements are requested to submit copies of relevant documentation in response to this Request for Information at no cost to the Government.  Written responses should be submitted not later than close of business 09 March 2007.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  The submission of the product information should not be construed as a commitment to procure equipment.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  Reponses should be submitted to the contact person listed above at Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CTQ 026, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS OR SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY !

<SUBJECT>Increase to N66001-04-C-8006 - Vermillion: Traffic for False Positives Generation with Simulated Worm Technology
<DESC>The Government intends to add related tasking to N66001-04-C-8006 with the contractor Skaion. This added tasking will increase the value of the contract from approximately $1,344K to approximately $1,439K. This $95K modification is for support to a Government-owned computer network test facility (346 Test Squadron) located at San Antonio, Texas.  DARPA has selected the 346 Test Squadron facility to verify and validate elements of a scheme to eradicate destructive computer worms and viruses in real-time before they have the opportunity to propagate. Skaion has participated in this program, called Dynamic Quarantine of Worms (DQW) since its inception, by providing test vectors, analysis, and support.   This modification will enable DARPA to conduct go/no-go testing for decision-making regarding the next phase of the DQW program. Under the existing contract, Skaions unique tasking has been to develop and exploit vulnerabilities in networked computers.  Extensive experience Skaion has gained with the operational environment at the 346 Test Squadron network is unique and not available from other contractors in the context of the DQW program goals.  The 346 Test Squadron network is being used as an isolated network that is extensively instrumented to track the propagation of computer worms and viruses.  Proper test conduct involves validation tasks to guarantee known network configuration before, during, and after test, as well as re-engineering test parameters to compensate for unanticipated  test artifacts.  The level of sophistication and classified parameters of the tasking make Skaion the only available source of tailored attacks. The original Skaion contract did not allow for the scale of unanticipated network configuration issues at the 346 Test Squadron site.  Firstly, the proposed new tasking will improve the extensive data-logging capability of the 346 Test Squadron to permit more sophisticated collection and analysis of test data.  Secondly, on-site reengineering of attack programs (known as test vectors)  will permit the successful continuation of the go-no/go testing needed by the DQW program.  Upon conclusion of the go/no-go testing for the DQW program, no further changes to this contract are anticipated.  Follow-on work under this program is the subject of a new Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). NAICS 541511.

<SUBJECT>66 -- 0.1W, 4.2K air cooled Optical Cryocooler for a Mass Spectrometer
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Janis Research Company, Inc., Wilmington, MA for a 0.1 Watt, 4.2K Optical Cryocooler system. This notice is for informational purposes only. The provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15, FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), along with Statutory Exception 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source. The optical cryostat system manufactured by Janis Research Company, Inc., which provides the interface to the existing mass spectrometer, incorporates a Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Model SRDK 101D-A11, air cooled cryocooler. The Quantum Information and Measurements project requires a compact 4.2 K optical Cryocooler for incorporation into a mass spectrometer detection system. The cooler will be used in conjunction with cryogenic detectors to extend the mass range of the mass spectrometer from ~30 kDaltons to >500kDaltons. This project will greatly expand the utility of mass spectrometry for applications such as the screening of anti-viral drugs and differentiation of viral genomes, as well as the homeland security demand for rapid identification of pathogenic viruses. Since the spectrometer may be deployed in locations (such as biology laboratories for protein research or rapid response locations for Homeland Security) where water cooling  is not available and the ability to reject power to air is limited, this refrigerator must be air cooled (not water cooled) and dissipate the smallest amount of power possible.  This Sumitomo Model SRDK 101D-A11 cryocooler best satisfies the government?s requirements that the cryocooler must be air-cooled (not water cooled), that power dissipation of the custom spectrometer system must be minimized since it may be deployed in locations where water cooling is not available and where the ability to reject power to air is limited. Janis Research Company Inc. is the sole authorized distributor in the U.S. for this cryocooler. No formal solicitation will be issued.  No awards will be made on the basis of requests for response this notice. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Janis Research Company, Inc. Any questions involving this procurement can be submitted by email to jacqueline.s.wright@noaa.gov, or by telephone, 303-497-5282.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO.: 04 - M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274:

This amendment number 05 revises the Agency?s response to questions 3 and 53 that were posted in Amendment numbers 03 and 04 on February 15, 2007; and incorporates new requirement on Marking and Branding Strategy under ADS 320 under the selection process section.  

3.	Question:  Will all selected firms be required to prepare a proposal for every task order? 

Revised Response:  In limiting the number of awards under this IQC, USAID hopes that most awardees will compete for most task orders.  However, we respect the business decisions that may guide a firm not to compete for a particular task order.  Therefore, it is not mandatory that an offeror must submit a proposal for each task order.

53.	Question:  The contract mentions that the contractor may be required to perform work may in disaster/conflict areas. Question: Putting disaster areas aside for the moment, does a conflict area include hostile and war-torn areas where the personal safety of our employees is an issue? Question: And if so, would the contractor have the option to turn down an assignment where the company feared for the safety of employees in that kind of situation. 

Revised Response:  The offerors should recognize that working in conflict/disaster prone areas is a major part of this statement of work.  However, we respect the business decisions that may guide a firm not to compete for a particular task order.  Therefore, it is not mandatory that an offeror must submit a proposal for each task order.

Please incorporate the following requirement under the Selection Process, second paragraph, and first sentence:

?Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions and the Branding Strategy (BS) to the short-listed firms (see ADS320.3.2.2 and 320.3.2.3). Those firms will be required to submit a cost submission and Branding Implementation Plan and Marking Plan.  They will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide their cost submission.
