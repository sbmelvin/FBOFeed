<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR CASA 212 PILOT   TRAINING
NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.
This is a market survey for CASA 212 Pilot Training.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing specified Pilot Training.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611512, Flight Training, with a size standard of $25.5 million.  
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make the determination, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
