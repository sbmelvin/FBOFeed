<CONTACT>David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The Delegation of the Kingdom of The Netherlands to NATO plans to release a Notification of Intent (NOI) to pre-finance some works aimed to replace High Frequency (HF) receivers at Noordwijk and Den Helder radio stations.  Works are intended to replace existing receivers by 29 remotely controlled receivers, which will be part of the Broadcast and Ship-Shore (BRASS) program in The Netherlands.  This program will be funded by the NATO Security Investment Program with an estimated cost share of these works at EUR 575,000, inclusive of contingencies at 10% and National Administrative Expenses at 5%.  The Dutch delegation did not indicate with regard to the potential cost share to be borne by NATO.  NATO share varied depending on specific items from 38% to 58%.

The Infrastructure Committee of the North Atlantic Council reports that the Dutch delegation has also requested a waiver from International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and authorization to award the contract following National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures as works have to be implemented as expeditiously as possible and the scope is limited to commercial off the shelf hardware.  As a result, the Dutch will conduct the procurement through their own national procedures, but all NATO members may nominate qualified firms to participate in this competition.  The Netherlands intends to award the contract after the Infrastructure Committee notes her pre-financing statement.  There is no indication on when works will be completed.

The Infrastructure Committee has authorized the implementation of HF transmitters in The Netherlands at AC/4(PP)D/22209 and AC/4-DS(97)34.  The implementation of the BRASS program NATO wide is programmed in Capability Package 9B3012/5A0006, serial 9CM80089, and remains programmed under the same serial in Revision 1 to Capability Package 9B3012/5A0006, which is now being screened by the International Military Staff and the International Staff.  Therefore, the Staff confirms that works are currently eligible for common funding and will remain eligible for common funding in the North American Council approves Revision 1 to Capability Package 9B3012/5A0006.

ALL FIRMS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCUREMENT MUST BE CERTIFIED AND NOMINATED BY THEIR NATIONAL DELEGATIONS WITH THE REQUIRED DECLARATION OF ELIGIBILITY.  REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED.  The deadline for interested and qualified firms to be certified and nominated to the bidder list is 3 January 2005.  YOUR FIRM MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BID MATERIALS FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS.  THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT IS THE CONTRACTING ENTITY.  Only firms the U.S. Department of Commerce has declared eligible and has nominated to the bidders list by the 4 January 2005 deadline will be allowed to bid.

<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation of offers to operate commercial visitor services within Virgin Islands National Park (St. John).  The operation will include watersports activities on a year-round schedule at Maho Bay.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $280,000 annually. The term of this contract is expected to be 10 years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of four percent (4%) of gross revenue per year. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51, has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are not expected to be greater than $500,000 in the first year of the contract. Therefore, there is a preferred offeror for this contract and all offers will be evaluated according to the terms set forth in the Prospectus.  Offers must be received in our office by close of business at 4:00 p.m. on February 22, 2005. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).

CONTRACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting white papers on original scientific and policy research on the potential links between transportation and climate change and strategies that address the challenges posed by these links.    Each white paper is not to exceed seven pages, including a title page, and must include the offeror’s contact information (point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address).  Additional submission requirements are contained in the section entitled “Technical Requirements.”  Separate white papers must be submitted for each proposed project and multiple projects cannot be combined into a single white paper.  DOT anticipates funding no more than $400,000 for two to three projects but reserves the right to select any, all, or none of the proposals submitted.

SPECIAL NOTE:  White papers (Phase 1, “Pre-proposals”) should be submitted via email in PDF format on or before January 31, 2005.  No hard copy submissions are required.  A Government team of technical experts will review the white papers submitted in response to this announcement.  Submitters will be advised of the outcome and anticipated follow-up from this review as it is completed.    

BACKGROUND:  Transportation is a major source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), producing approximately one quarter of GHG emissions in the United States.  Because transportation is the nation’s fastest growing sector, transportation’s share of GHG emissions is increasing.  Therefore, reductions in transportation emissions will be an important component of national approaches to avert climate change.  Strategies to reduce GHG emissions will certainly affect transportation providers and consumers. 

Equally important to the mobility of the nation, the effects of climate change may jeopardize portions of our transportation infrastructure.  These potential impacts must be identified and analyzed so that the DOT can develop strategies to protect, maintain, and adapt our transportation networks, as necessary.

Much of DOT’s research to deal with climate change is managed through the DOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting (Center).  Created in 1999, the Center functions as a “One-DOT,” virtual organization led by a Steering Committee representing eight DOT Operating Administrations (Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Maritime Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the Research and Special Programs Administration) and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.  Through strategic research, policy analysis, partnerships, and outreach, the Center promotes comprehensive and multimodal approaches to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gases to mitigate the effects of transportation on global climate change and to identify adaptation strategies to deal with the challenges posed by climate change.

In 2003, the Center issued its first Broad Agency Announcement (DTRS56-04-BAA-0001) and selected six projects for awards in August 2004.  Information regarding those projects and other activities of the Center can be found at http://www.dot.gov/climate.

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:  The purposes of this BAA are to:

•	Promote research on transportation and climate change;
•	Enhance the nation’s understanding of the links between transportation and climate change;
•	Provide a sound scientific basis to inform national and international decisionmaking;
•	Establish new linkages within the transportation community on climate change issues; and
•	Foster successful research partnerships.
	
The research solicited under this BAA will support the U.S. DOT in understanding and addressing transportation-related GHG emissions, examine innovation in the transportation planning and decision-making processes pertinent to climate change matters, and/or improve knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the transportation sector.  The funding is intended to support scientific research or policy analysis, but not technology development or demonstration.  The Center is interested in funding projects related to one or more of the following topic areas:

1.  Impact of Climate Variability and Change on Transportation 
This research will examine the potential effects of climate variability and change on transportation infrastructure and services and will identify potential adaptation strategies for use by transportation decision makers, infrastructure builders and operators, and state and local planners.  

2.  Increasing Energy Efficiency and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
This research will examine opportunities for mitigating the GHG impact of the transportation sector.  Projects may consider the potential for conservation through more efficient transportation practices, new or emerging technologies, the substitution of non-fossil fuels, market-based options (e.g., emissions charges and trading), or other methods.  Research may pertain to any aspect of reducing the sector’s GHG emissions, from increasing industry adoption and consumer acceptance of new technologies to overcoming challenges in technology development and deployment.

3.  Data, Estimation and Modeling  
This research will focus on developing and improving analytical tools and emissions or other data that could support transportation decision making at all levels of government and in the private sector. Data or estimation may involve research aimed at improving estimates of transportation greenhouse gas emissions or the emissions consequences of particular actions.   Modeling work may involve fiscal instruments and other market mechanisms, vehicle and fuel characteristics, transportation system design and operation, or other research areas.  Research in this area should provide a better basis for evaluating a broad range of multimodal transportation-related options at different geographic scales.  Research will help identify the contributions of various transportation modes to GHG emissions in the context of other GHG emissions, and help identify optimum mitigation options considering a multimodal approach.

4. Institutional Capacity Building 
This research will analyze the prevailing institutional framework (i.e., the current and proposed legal and regulatory guidance, organization and management, administrative structures and processes of decision making) that supports or constrains the implementation of multimodal and intersectoral GHG emission reduction strategies at the local, metropolitan, State and Federal levels of government. The research should also address the current and potential problems and partnership opportunities arising from the interaction between U.S.-based multinational corporations operating in foreign countries subject to international GHG agreements.  The research may address the U.S. Federal interagency cooperation activities involving domestic and international governmental partners as well as corporate stakeholders. The research will review the adequacy of resources available at all levels of government to accomplish the stated policy objectives, including the opportunities for career advancement, professional education and training at U.S. universities and foreign academic centers of excellence.

WHITE PAPERS: The Government will select projects through a two-phase process of proposal submission, review, and acceptance.  In Phase 1, organizations are invited to submit white papers.  A team of Government technical experts will review and evaluate the white papers.  Based on this review, the submitters of those white papers selected for further consideration will be requested to submit full proposals (Phase 2) in accordance with the guidance provided later in this announcement.

FAR 52.217-8 AND 52.217-9 Option to extend contract.   The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation’s minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors’ proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors – commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors’ technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors’ technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror’s Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors – Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror’s past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror’s past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror’s past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror’s past performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer (LBC) Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, 221 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115 for the services to develop analytic models of algorithms related to the body  mass index in utero, in infancy, or early childhood through adult years, with data from the Maternal Cohort Study of the Nurses’ Health Studies I and II in collaboration with Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham Woman’s Hospital.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The overall project objective is to develop repeated measures of body mass index from the Maternal Cohort Study and biannual follow-ups of the Nurses’ Health Cohort Study II; develop and test a mixed effect model of body fat over the life course; examine the risk of obesity in adulthood attributed to infant feeding, childhood diet and other early life exposures.   The results of the analysis will contribute to NCI’s understanding of the potential role of body fat, diet, and risk of obesity in adult years in order to determine whether early life exposures are related to adult obesity, a recognized risk factor for cancer and for cancer mortality.; perform descriptive analysis of the data; and test the model by performing statistical analysis using various software system.  Period of Performance: January 24, 2005 - June 30, 2005.   The collaboration between Brigham and Woman’s Hospital and NCI began in 1999.   Dr. Michels is the co-Principal Investigator on the Maternal Cohort Study and is a member of the original team.  She is responsible for testing specific hypothesis on the Maternal Cohort study, and because all data are cleaned and programmed from the Brigham and Woman’s Hospital.  In addition she has successfully maintained follow-up of the nurse daughters, once every two (2) years.  The nurse daughters are part of the Nurses Health Study I and II, who have been loyal participants with a high response rate of 95% over time.  The  Brigham and Women’s Hospital is the only source known to the NCI that is familiar with the original files from which the subset of data have been taken. Changing coding teams at this time would interrupt the interpretation of the study objectives.  Brigham and Women’s Hospital is the only source known to the government the has rights regarding this database.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance to support and facilitate the implementation and operation of a wide area testbed capability and advanced test and evaluation of system performance of a seamless satellite navigation system in Southeast Asia.

The APEC Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) TestBed will facilitate the research, development, acquisition, and implementation efforts of an operational air navigation system based on GNSS technologies.  The TestBed aims to support a uniform implementation of GNSS throughout the APEC region.  The TestBed will enhance satellite-based civil navigation implementation by demonstrating how the GNSS-based navigation technology would function across Asia's flight information regions and how these economies would have to coordinate to accomplish their mutual goal of improved regional aviation navigation.  The TestBed will allow for an incremental implementation of system components and capabilities, and thus allow the APEC economies to proceed with satellite navigation implementation at an expeditious pace.  The TestBed will also provide a “menu” for the economies to decide what test bed components are desired and needed, what costs are affordable, and what schedule of activities works best for all of the region's economies.

Aeronautical Radio of Thailand Limited (AEROTHAI) would act as Grantee on behalf of the other APEC economy participants, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.  AEROTHAI is a state enterprise under the Ministry of Transport of Thailand that has provided air traffic control and aeronautical communication services for airline and airfreight operations in Thailand for 55 years.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $675,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Inmedius, Inc for modifying an existing publisher product and add a converter that allows the F/A 18 data, developed by Inmedius to be read by the Automated Maintenance Environment (AME) system. The publisher product is proprietary to Inmedius, therefore it is necessary to go sole source with Inmedius to avoid the data rights issues. The anticipated completion of the effort is 30 April 2005. 
 
The F/A-18 program is implementing its training for the F/A-18 AME using the Navy’s new Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) training methodology and standards. The F/A-18 program is also converting its I-Level engine technical manuals from .pdf documents to IETMs using the DoD’s new S1000D technical manual standard. This requirement is to provide a single presentation system that will:
·	Provide concurrent viewing of both the training content data and the engine manual content data via JATDI servers and Internet Explorer browsers on NMCI or legacy work stations (the presentation system is a Web-based system)
·	Provide error and omission feedback capabilities via the complementary F/A-18 Help Request Document (HRD) system using the same JATDI servers and Internet Explorer browsers on NMCI or legacy work stations (the HRD system is currently implemented in the fleet for Boeing O-Level IETMs [87269 standard] using legacy servers provided by the F/A-18 program)
·	Be tested with the JATDI hardware and software in the NAVAIR LITMIS Lab for compatibility with NMCI requirements and also in the SPAWAR Norfolk IT-21 Lab for compatibility with shipboard requirements.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and technical capability statement in response to this notice. Navair Orlando Contracts shall consider all responses. Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated.  Any questions about this notice, please contact Jun Ji, Code 25334 at 407-380-4020 or jun.ji@navy.mil

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institutes Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch (DMNB), plans to procure on a sole source basis for Human Genome Arrays and Cycle Labeling Kits from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  DMNB has an on going study on Fabry Disease.  The mechanism of the disease and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), as part of this study gene expression of the human transcriptome will be done prior to and 6 months after ERT.  These are the only arrays that are compatible with the existing NINDS Government owned Affymetrix equipment and will be used in continuation of ongoing experiments and related genomic work on Fabry Disease which was done using Affymetrix chips.  Changing chips now would affect the scientific validity and add new variables into on-going protocols.  Therefore, these arrays must be procured from Affymetrix. Affymetrix is the only known contractor that can provide arrays that are compatible with the existing equipment and will not add new variables to on going experiments.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on January 4, 2005, faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), through the Program Support Center intends to award a sole source simplified acquisition to the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) for training and logistical support function in promoting, organizing and presenting five regional grant application workshops for SAMHSA/CSAP and the Drug Free Communities Program.  This acquisition requires the ability to assist with the recruitment of participants and execution of an effective workshop session that is totally compatible with the Congressional intent of the Drug Free Communities Program.  CADCA as the current contractor for the Drug Free Communities Program, has a unique understanding of the overall complexities and intricacies of the Drug Free Communities Program, the requirements of the grant program and the challenges that communities face in applying for funding, and CADCA is the only national organization whose mission is to build the capacity of community anti-drug coalitions.  CADCA maintains a database of over 10,000 community coalitions who are possible applicants to the Drug Free Communities Program. Therefore, CADCA plays a critical role in the ability to disseminate information about these grant application workshops, recruit potential participants to attend and assist with the training format, implementation and follow up technical assistance.

<DESC>The TSA intends to negotiate separate single-source contracts with InVision Technologies and L-3 Communications Corporation for maintenance of Government owned and/or operated Explosive Detection System (EDS) and Threat Image Projection (TIP) Ready X-ray (TRX) equipment.  The purpose of this work is to perform both corrective and preventive maintenance for the identified equipment.  

TSA is negotiating single-source contracts because only these two vendors, InVision Technologies (of Newark, CA) and L-3 Communications (of St. Petersburg, FL) can perform the subject work.  Both vendors are the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for the Government owned EDS and L3 TRX equipment.  Only the OEMs for this equipment have the requisite expertise to perform the work.  The OEMs have been performing this maintenance work for the past two years.  

TSA anticipates award of a five year maintenance contract to each vendor.  Each contract will have a one year base and four one-year options.  The anticipated award date for these contracts is February 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  In the technical proposal, Offerors shall address the Management Plan, Course Syllabi, Quality Assurance Plan, ATC certification Plan, Student training plan sample progress reports, and résumés.

              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed.
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

STATEMENT OF WORK

TECHNICAL SERVICES SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLMENATION, AND OPERATION OF A WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT AND COUNTERTERRORISM TRAINING AND TESTING FACILITY AND PROGRAM

1.0	 BACKGROUND

The mission of the Center for National Response (CNR) at the Memorial Tunnel in West Virginia is to train and prepare federal, state and local agencies to conduct full spectrum operations in support of homeland security.  In its Homeland Defense role, the Department of Defense (DoD) has the mission to develop, implement, and operate a Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) Consequence Management (CoM) and Counterterrorism (CT) Training and Testing Facility.  The CNR at the Memorial Tunnel is the location best suited for performance of this mission.  It has been functional for approximately four years now.  A new contract initiative is being developed to address the long-term sustainment and further development of this critical capability.  

     The Center for National Response (CNR) was established by directions of Congress in the FY 2000 Defense Appropriations Bill.  Section 8111 of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2561 authorizes the Department of Defense to initiate and expand activities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to a terrorist attack in the United States involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The establishment of a cost effective consequence management and counterterrorism training and testing facility and program for DOD units and personnel, other US Government Agencies, plus state and local first responders and concurrent testing of response apparatus and equipment at the Memorial Tunnel was one of the initiatives mandated by this legislation.  

   The CNR has evolved as part of a National Guard Bureau effort to establish two Joint Interagency Training Centers.  The CNR is now a part of the evolving Joint Interagency Training Center – East (JITC-E) operated on behalf of the Chief on National Guard Bureau (NGB) by The Adjutant General of West Virginia (TAG-WV) and the West Virginia National Guard (WVNG).   It is envisioned that the CNR will be one of four centers within the JITC-E and will be fully integrated into its overarching Live, Virtual and Constructive training capability.   A performance based services contract is best suited for this work effort.  It allows for flexibility and adaptation in training; facilities maintenance and upgrades; modifications and enhancements to training aids, devices, simulators and simulations (TADSS) and day-to-day operations of the capability.  The contractor’s performance will be based on several criteria.  Critical among them is the efficacy and value of the training provided as measured by feedback from the training audience and the conformity of the training delivered to training objectives, established standards and practices.

2.0  SCOPE

The contractor will perform all missions related to operations and training at  the CNR  Memorial Tunnel in West Virginia.  Specifically, the contractor will maintain current operational levels, while continually enhancing capabilities for a Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) Consequence Management (CoM) and Counterterrorism (CT) Training and Testing Facility and Program for Federal, State and Local WMD/CoM/CT response elements.  Concurrently, the contractor will execute appropriate testing programs for evaluating response procedures and equipment.  This overarching objective will be accomplished as part of NGB’s JITC-E.  For FY05, the contractor will continue to execute current training schedules (attached) and develop recommended revisions to the implementation plan for the CNR.  This effort will include, but is not limited to providing WMD/CoM/CT training, training management  and exercise control; development of  a plan to enable integration of  the CNR as a key component  of the NGB JITC-E efforts and provide input, as appropriate, to the strategic plan to integrate  multiple agency requirements into a synergistic effort.  Contractor’s performance should help the government’s efforts to market CNR capabilities as a premier, cost effective training and exercise capability.

<DESC>NASA MSFC plans to continue their Site Licenses Agreement (SLA) to allow NASA MSFC to use existing Unigraphics Solutions (UGS) software for up to five years, including any software updates developed during the term of the SLA. The proposed SLA will provide up to 45 concurrent licenses UGS CAx, Teamcenter Engineering and basic visualization software, and up to 75 licenses for Solid Edge.  It will also include up to seven licenses of all other UGS software including VisView, Teamcenter Enterprise, and IDEAS CAD.  The SLA will not include any requirements for software installation, software maintenance; on-site technical support, consulting/implementation services (managed services) and training.   NASA MSFC plans to continue the SLA with Unigraphics Solutions on a sole-source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	 1.  The aforementioned software has unique capabilities and is the only software available that will satisfy MSFC’s requirements.  Unigraphics functions that are or will be used in the design process include WAVE, Knowledge Fusion, Direct Modeling, Assembly Weight Management and User Defined Features.  Only Teamcenter Engineering has the capability to manage the multiple layers of file linking created by these features and their interactions.  Only VisView is integrally linked with Unigraphics NX and Teamcenter Engineering to extract all available information for non-CAD users. 2.  To procure other software would not be cost effective because approximately 200 users currently trained in the use of Unigraphics NX, Solid Edge, Teamcenter Engineering and other associated modules would have to be retrained to use other software.  In comparison to comparable vendors training prices, the cost to retrain these users is estimated at $500K plus severe loss of productivity during the extended learning curve required to transition to a different mechanical CAD package.  This will result in a substantial duplication of costs.  In addition, a considerable number of software libraries and customized programs have been developed to interface and integrate with Unigraphics, Solid Edge, Teamcenter Engineering and other associated modules.  Recreation of these libraries and customized programs to interface and integrate with any other applications would require a considerable amount of labor and would result in unacceptable delays since the use of this software greatly enhances the design process by reducing the design cycle and interaction time.  In the long term, lacking the demonstrated ability to reduce time and cut costs for the detailed design process, as well as the delay in technology development will jeopardize the capture of future development projects. 3.  UGS is the only source for the software and licenses.  In order for any other supplier to furnish MSFC with the software and licenses, it would have to procure the same from UGS and simply increase the cost with no value added.   Interested firms have 5 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their capabilities and qualifications.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after the 5 days or without the required information will be considered nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:	http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>This acquisition is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The NAICS code is 531320 and the size standard to qualify as a small business is less $1,500,000 average annual gross receipts for the past three (3) years.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is initiating multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with qualified appraisers throughout the State of Montana for use by the NRCS in appraising conversation easements.  The lands to be appraised are rural in character, typically with agriculture, grazing, recreation, transitional and rural residential uses.  Improvements are sometimes present.  Appraisers shall be Certified General Real Property Appraisers in the State of Montana and shall comply with all state regulations pertaining to real estate appraisal services.  The appraiser shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, personnel, facilities, transportation, travel and per diem.  The Government will provide the information outlined in paragraph F of the Scope of Services.

The estimated start date for the BPA is February 7, 2005 and will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.  We envision entering into several BPAs.  All interested appraisers are invited to submit proposals for consideration and award of a BPA. Instructions for submitting an offer are provided in FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors on page 2.  Proposals are due no later than 4:00 p.m. on January 21, 2004.  Early submission is encouraged and may result in an early award of a BPA.  Proposals may be submitted by fax to Marsha Harris at (406) 587-6808 or mailed to:

		USDA – NRCS;

A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs.  It is not a contract.  The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor are appraisers obligated to accept any orders.  For each appraisal assignment, a Scope of Services will be provided and the Government will request a price proposal from one or more of the appraisers that have been awarded BPAs.  The standard Scope of Services is attached to the solicitation, however, the Government may provide an alternate Scope of Services at the time price proposals for a specific appraisal are requested.

Individual task order proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPAs.  Government personnel authorized to place task orders under the BPAs will be identified on the BPAs by name and telephone number.  The appraiser will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of BPAs, without need for additional paperwork beyond the Scope of Services that accompanies the request for proposal.  A draft BPA is attached to the solicitation.

Timely delivery of complete and accurate appraisals is crucial to the success of NRCS conservation programs.  As a result, the BPA will include a clause to incentivize timely deliver.  This clause is found on pages 2and 3 of the BPA.

All appraisers must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be awarded a BPA.  You may register easily and quickly on-line at www.ccr.gov.

The Federal Acquisition Regulations will be modified effective January 1, 2005.  This modification will require all contractors interested in contracting with the U.S. Government to complete On-Line Representations and Certifications in place of a hard copy of clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, thus eliminating the need to resubmit this information with each proposal submitted.  This on-line system is not yet available.  As a result, this solicitation includes a hard copy of this clause for completion.  Offerors are put on notice, however, that they may be required to complete the electronic representations and certifications prior to award of a BPA.

<DESC>AIR FORCE MILITARY HOUSING PRIVATIZATION PRIVATIZATION REAL ESTATE SUPPORT SERVICES (PRESS) MODIFICATION #1 TO PRESS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): We anticipate awarding approximately five contracts on the PRESS source selection. Approximately three (3) contracts may be awarded under full and open competition and approximately two (2) contracts may be awarded under small business set-aside procedures. The number of full and open or SB set-aside awards may increase or decrease. Only fully qualified proposals will be awardable.
The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, Housing Directorate Privatization Division (AFCEE/HDP) is seeking information from sources capable of providing private sector financial expertise to support the Air Force Military Housing Privatization Projects throughout the United States and its territories.  The shortened description for this effort is Privatization Real Estate Support Services (PRESS).  This announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  

Potential sources shall be able to provide financial and real estate privatization development services, including Enhanced Use Leasing (EUL) and lodging privatization expertise, in support of the Air Force Military Family Housing Privatization Program.  The ultimate goal of this effort is successful closure of real estate transactions for privatization of military family housing at selected Air Force Installations.  Currently, the Air Force has several installations (Air Force Bases) in various stages of eligibility and preparation for housing privatization.  The Air Force envisions competitively awarding an estimated $88 million program ceiling to be divided among multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to support housing privatization at various locations.

A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding less than four contracts under this effort.

The estimated issue date for the RFP is on or about Tuesday, November 09, 2004. A modification will be made to this announcement issuing the RFP for review.

Solicitation N62467-05-R-0080, Sources sought for the Indefinite Quantity Solicitation for Facilitator Services for NAVFAC EFD SOUTH Partnering Team Meetings in 26 state AOR as follows: AL, FL, GA, IL, IN, KY, MI, MS, NC, OH, SC, TN WI, AR, CO, IA, KS, LA, MN, MO, ND, NE, OK, SD, TX, AND WY.  NOTE 8(a), HUBZone and Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business firms: At least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  The contractor may also, on occasion, be tasked to provide the services described herein to any DOD or other Federal Agency activities outside the Southern Division geographical area.  These projects will be assigned on an exception basis as determined by the Contracting Officer.  A minimum of $20,000.00 shall be guaranteed.  This guaranteed fee is a certain obligation at the time of the award and as such will be fulfilled with the base year of the contract.  This contract, N62467-05-R-0080, is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year options and will not exceed $3,000,000.  No new work can be added after one year following award of the initial work unless the option year is exercised.  This work includes, but is not limited to the following services:  The Environmental Department of Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC EFD SOUTH) is responsible for providing environmental engineering services in support of the Navy’s Installation Restoration Program at any Naval or Marine Corps activity under the cognizance of NAVFAC EFD SOUTH. One of the primary missions of the Environmental Department is to identify, investigate, assess, characterize, and clean up or control releases of hazardous substances; and to reduce the risk to human health and the environment from past waste disposal operations and hazardous material spills at Navy/Marine Corps activities. This effort requires expanding Southern Division’s quality philosophy to include improving the effectiveness of the relationship between the Navy (Southern Division and Activities) and the regulators, both state and federal. A key element in coordination of this effort is the process of partnering. The partnership structure is made up of two groups, Tier I and Tier II. The Tier I teams are Activity-specific teams consisting of individuals from each agency, contractors, and the Activity. The Tier II teams consist of management individuals from each of the various agencies as well as the contractors and Activities. To implement Southern Division’s quality philosophy into this process and to optimize the effectiveness of these meetings, the Navy requires the services of an outside professional facilitator for both Tier I and Tier II partnering meetings who is very knowledgeable in the philosophy and use of tools of Total Quality Leadership. The purpose of this requirement is to provide facilitator services for these partnering meetings and to provide team building training for the members of these teams. If adequate interest is not received from 8(a) concerns, consideration will then be given to setting the requirements aside for HUBZone concerns.  If adequate interest is not received from HUBZone concerns, considerations will then be given to setting the requirements aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns.  Also, if adequate interested is received from 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside concerns, it is the Contracting Officer’s determination on how this will be set-aside per Small Business Administration guidelines.  If adequate interest is not received form 8(A), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns, then the requirement will be issued Small Business Set-Aside as N62467-05-R-0080 Indefinite Quantity solicitation for Facilitator Services for NAVFAC EFD SOUTH Partnering Meetings.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  Its purpose is to generate responses from qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, veteran owned, woman owned, or small business concerns, which have the interest and ability to provide FDA with access to outpatient and longitudinal drug utilization data.  FDA is not interested in developing a database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  Contractors interested in this requirement must submit a capability statement.  A one (1) year base contract with two (2), one (1) year options is intended.  The objectives are: (1) to provide FDA personnel with real-time, immediate, direct, multi-user, desktop access to currently existing, commercially available, longitudinal data with the capability of providing current and historical national-level counts of outpatient prescriptions over time; (2) to provide FDA personnel with real-time, immediate, direct, multi-user, desktop access to currently existing, commercially available, longitudinal data with the capability of providing national-level counts of unique patients utilizing prescription drug products in an outpatient setting over time; (3) to provide patient- and prescription-level information, in either the same or separate, linked resources.  If separate linked data resources are proposed, all individuals in the patient-level data resource shall link directly to their prescription data; (4) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to use these data to characterize the duration of exposure to prescription drug products at a patient level and to examine concomitant use of multiple drug products at a patient level over the same time period; (5) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to use these data to describe national patterns of drug utilization in the outpatient setting through the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies that are scientifically sound and transparent to FDA personnel; (6) to provide FDA personnel with direct, unlimited, Internet or network-based access to all HIPAA-compliant longitudinal data in a multi-user environment and in real time; and (7) to provide FDA personnel with the ability to download (or obtain in a timely manner using other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.  These data shall meet the need of the FDA to access patient-level data describing outpatient prescription drug use in individuals over time, i.e., longitudinally.  The longitudinal data shall include information at both the patient and prescription level.  Offerors shall also provide data that will meet FDA¡¯s need for nationally-based, prescription-level outpatient information.  The data shall include historic prescription information at a national level for trend analyses.  The size and characteristics of the population of patients or covered lives from which the patient-level data are derived shall be provided to FDA, since these can affect the quality and usefulness of the data provided and the validity of national projections from the data.  Characteristics shall minimally include: number of individual patients or covered lives; number and percent of patients or covered lives with at least two years of continuous activity; number and percent of patients or covered lives with corresponding enrollment information (if applicable); availability to FDA of enrollment/eligibility/participant inclusion information for use in data analyses; number and percentage of active patients or covered lives in populations of special interest to FDA (including children (ages ¡Ü 17 years) , women of child-bearing age, and elderly (ages ¡Ý 65 years)); turnover or churn rate for participation in the data resource; geographic diversity; demographics; coverage or inclusion policies relevant to pharmaceutical products under health care plans providing the majority of the data (if applicable); and availability to FDA of clinical or medical data (desired, but not required).  If clinical or medical data are available, the number and percent of the total population for whom these data are accessible and detailed information describing how this information is linked to the pharmacy data is required.  In addition, information that will allow FDA to describe and quantify the administration of drug- or biologic products in the outpatient setting by healthcare professionals (e.g., administration of chemotherapy to cancer patients, administration of drugs in conjunction with dialysis) is also desired, if available.  These longitudinal data shall follow uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers) over time either across or within ambulatory health care plans.  Age and gender shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  Prescription drug utilization data shall be provided and shall include the generic/established name of the drug, strength, dosage form and all dates dispensed (including initial/refill indication), quantity dispensed, days supply and prescriber specialty.  Directions for use and method of payment shall also be included, if available.  Current and historical national-level prescription information shall include counts of prescriptions at both the generic and established name level, as well as information on strength, dosage form, initial/refill indicator, and date (month/year) dispensed.  Current data shall include patient-level demographic information.  Aggregate demographic information related to historical prescription drug use is desired, but not required.  To determine whether the data meet the needs of the FDA for making timely regulatory decisions based on the most current, scientifically valid information available, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the total number of years of data available overall and in real time to FDA personnel; the ability and ease of accessing data that is no longer on-line; and the lag time between the date of service for the patient prescription and on-line availability of the data.  Offerors shall also provide a description of the offeror¡¯s data acquisition process for both the patient- and prescription- level drug utilization data.  All data flow and management procedures shall be described, including data acquisition, cleaning, and editing procedures, data de-identification procedures, specification and description of all coding systems used for diagnoses, procedures and drugs, methods for coding data, percentage of missing or incomplete information and method of coding missing data, availability of raw/sample numbers, as well as projected numbers, and the frequency with which data are updated and methods for updates.  A current and complete data dictionary shall be included.  FDA requires the ability to use both the patient- and prescription-level data to estimate drug utilization patterns in the total U.S. outpatient population, or in a national sub-population of interest (e.g., children (¡Ü 17 years), women of child-bearing age, elderly (¡Ý 65 years)).  This shall require the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies, which shall be valid, reliable, and robust with regard to drug utilization specifically, and the methods fully disclosed.  If such methodology has not been developed, a commitment in the form of a detailed development plan, strategic outline and timeline to collaborate with FDA investigators to develop and implement it within 6 months is required.  Demographics and other relevant characteristics for patients included in the sample to be used for projection or other appropriate methodologies, as well as for the proposed universe, shall be included.  Interested offerrs shall provide (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (3) any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance FDA¡¯s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) number 223-05-3000 and include the following:  (1) name and address of firm, (2) type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.) (3) two points of contact:  name, title, phone, fax and e-mail, (4) DUNS number, (5) NAICS codes, (6) contractor¡¯s capabilities statement which provides the information stated above, (7) list of customers covering the past 5 years including a summary of animal husbandry work performed, contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and identify your role as either the Prime or Subcontractor.

<SUBJECT>A -- DSWC 05-06  Food Biological Agent Detection Sensor (FBADS)
<DESC>The Homeland Security Research Advanced Projects Agency (HSARPA) seeks to develop, test and commercialize a new set of laboratory detection methods for use on the food supply system. Food detection systems will require rapid, high-confidence detection of a biologic microbial and/or toxin threat in order to enable advanced strategies to protect individuals from exposure
and reduce contamination of critical infrastructure.

HSARPA intends to initiate the Food Biological Agent Detection Sensor (FBADS) program, which seeks to develop, test and transition cost-effective detection methods for use on the food
system, with a focus on liquid substrates. Specifically, HSARPA is looking for laboratory assays and detection methods that can be used at food manufacturing facilities, or before the food enters a processing/production facility. The FBADS program will develop optimized detection systems characterized by the following capabilities:
• Low limits of detection in complex matrices and should be able to detect agents in both
water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions;
• Automatic sample measurement and analysis;
• Rapid analysis (< 20 min);
• Able to identify a set of selected microbial pathogens and toxins;
• Able to identify agents attached to particles;
• Low cost of testing, so that it can be absorbed by industry and have practical use beyond protection of the food supply.
The FBADS initiative responds to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-9, “Defense of United States Agriculture and Food”. Under the FBADS initiative, we will focus on the following key detection system metrics: Sensitivity, False Positive Rate, Detection Confidence (Pd), Response Time and Low Cost of Ownership. The new detection systems
developed under the FBADS program described in this draft solicitation will provide the Department of Homeland Security with a detection system to prevent any wide-spread harm to
our nation’s critical food infrastructure.

We anticipate initiating awards for the FBADS in mid to late FY05, subject to the availability of future funding for this requirement. A future FBADS program Broad Agency Announcement
(BAA), which would follow from this Draft Statement of Work for Comments (DSWC), would solicit research in new and/or improved approaches to rapid detection food sensors. 

The purpose of this early DSWC is to invite the technical community to provide specific comment to HSARPA on the structure and content of a new program initiative in this area and to encourage potential bidders to engage in early technical discussions with HSARPA with regards to potential technical solutions to these challenges.

<SUBJECT>D -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SERVICES REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<DESC>1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Department of State’s (henceforth referred to as the Department or DoS) Bureau of Diplomatic Security’s (DS) Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) will be conducting a performance-based acquisition of integrated IT support services.  This acquisition will be an 8(a) competitive procurement effort.   Within this acquisition, DoS is considering the use of a Statement of Objectives (SOO) and a Fixed Price, Award Fee (FPAF) contract.  The period of performance is anticipated to include a base period of two years, with three one-year options.    

This is a Request For Information (RFI) to query qualified firms who have prior experience in providing these services for large federal agencies using a performance-based approach.  The Department seeks information on offerings, capabilities, and practices that are present today and those that are being developed for the future to maximum work output.

The information provided herein is for planning purposes only and should not be considered as exhaustive as the strategy for this acquisition may change prior to the release of the Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Department reserves the right to determine the appropriate method of procuring the services based upon its analysis and evaluation of the responses to current market research.

2.0 BACKGROUND

The CTO provides IT solutions and support to a community of approximately 2,000 end users within DS, both domestically and abroad.  The proposed contract will service three divisions within CTO:  1) Operations, 2) Systems Integration, and 3) Security Operations.  Contractor responsibilities will include, but are not limited to, the following descriptions: 

1.  Support of the Operations Division shall include providing for steady state service and operation of the DS IT infrastructure, to include server administration, help desk, end-user training, procurement of IT equipment and software, and maintenance of both network and end-user components (software, hardware, and peripherals).

2.  Within the Systems Integration Division, the contractor shall perform systems configuration management as well as design and implement client/server solutions for DS end users.

3.  To support the Security Operations Division, the contractor shall conduct account audits, network activity monitoring, anti-virus management, and other tasks to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data across all DS networks.  

It is anticipated that this acquisition will be conducted under NAICS 541513, Computer Facilities Management.

3.0 RFI RESPONSES

This RFI is being released to gain industry perspective, which will be used as the Department finalizes its acquisition approach and solicitation materials.  Specifically, DoS requests information on the following topics:

1.  Lessons learned with performance-based contracts, specifically FPAF contract types

2.  Discussion of industry risk factors relating to performance-based IT service contracts.

3.  Lead times necessary for formulation of a performance-based solution.

4.  Best practices relevant to IT systems management and help desk operations, to include proposed performance metrics addressing the functions of the three CTO divisions described above.

5.  Industry capability to address work surge requirements across the three CTO divisions.  Currently, surges occur for the installation/customization of network components or major overhaul or system upgrade.  Proposed alternatives for the current methodology will be examined during the process.

6.  Sample schedule outlining actions between contract award and full operational capacity.

All other comments relating to this requirement are also solicited by the Department of State.  The Government is receptive to any ideas from industry, which would result in limiting constraints on the potential awardees, realizing cost savings, highlighting potential contractual or technical problems, and maximizing a performance-based contract.

4.0 DISCLAIMER

Replies to this RFI are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals. The use of information received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the Government.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offeror’s information and the RFI should not be used by offerors to market their services. 
The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited. However, information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such and will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 TO SOLICITATION 223-05-3000

(FOR ORIGINAL SOLICITATION, PLEASE SEARCH UNDER BOTH ACTIVE AND ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS.)

THE DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS IS EXTENDED TO JANUARY 14, 2005 AT 4:00 PM

Solicitation 223-05-3000 is amended as follows:

1.	In Paragraph III.  SCOPE OF WORK, Subparagraph 4., Glossary, the following definitions are added:

Continuous:  Uninterrupted in time, sequence, substance, or extent.  In the case of an enrollment – or eligibility-based products, this would translate to the cohort of individuals with uninterrupted enrollment for a two-year period.  In the case of a non-enrollment- or non-eligibility-based data resources, the Offeror would be expected to provide an estimate of individuals with continuous pharmacy activity over a two year period.  FDA realizes that due to the nature of the source of data for these resources, this may be an approximation, and not as precise as the results for eligibility- or enrollment-based information.  FDA expects the Offeror to described in detail how this value is calculated, including assumptions and limitations of the result, and to cite appropriate references from the literature where necessary.

Churn rate: This is the term used to describe the same concept as a turnover rate, but in a system that is not eligibility-based.  If the offeror's data resource is not eligibility-based (e.g., if it is pharmacy-based), the Offeror is expected to estimate the ratio of the number of individuals who no longer are actively filling prescriptions to the total number of individuals who are actively filling prescriptions over the course of a calendar year.  FDA recognizes that due to the nature of the data resource, this will be an approximation.  FDA expects the Offeror to describe in detail how this rate was calculated, including assumptions and limitations of the result, and to cite appropriate references from the literature where necessary.

Turnover rate: This is a way to describe the yearly inflow and outflow of individuals within an eligibility-based data resource.  Generally, calculation of the turnover rate requires knowledge of the total number of eligible individuals (i.e., those covered by insurance) in the data resource over the course of a defined period of time.

2.	Paragraph VII.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS, the date for receipt of technical and business proposals is changed to January 14, 2005 at 4:00 PM.

3.	The following additional information is provided:

Question 1:  Is the purpose of the sample data test period to:  1) become familiar with the data (i.e., to assess and become familiar with data variables within a market), or 2) to identify the longitudinal nature of the data (more data months over time)?	

Response:  FDA requests access to the full, commercially available database to get a realistic idea of what will be involved in integrating the Offeror’s data resource into the current FDA functions.  Our goal is to understand how to use and interpret the data through running some sample queries.

Question 2:  For the purposes of the providing unlimited access to data, can it be assumed that the number of users at any given time will be ten?  Or is this an underestimation of the possible activity level?

Response:  As stated in the RFP, FDA requires a site license, or a licensing agreement that is not dependent on a specific number of users.  If the Offeror’s data resource is configured in such a way that there are limitations on the number of simultaneous or total users, the Offeror should clearly explain how this configuration is implemented ant the nature of these limitations.  The Offeror should also describe in detail FDA’s options for adding or reducing the total number of users during the contract period.

Question 3:  Can data access be approached in a variety of ways (i.e., Microstrategy tool, SAS datasets, etc.)?

Response:  FDA currently uses the Microsoft Office Suite of tools as well as SAS as part of our standard desktop.  If access to the data resource requires additional front-end software (such as Microstrategy) or hardware this should be clearly explained in the Offeror’s response.  FDA is willing to consider multiple access options as long as they conform to the technical requirements listed in the RFP.

Question 4:  How many markets are required of the RFP?  All?  Top 25?  Other?

Response:  FDA will require access to the entire data resource.  If the data resource is in the form of “cubes” or “markets”, FDA will require access to all of them.

Question 5:  How often are the database updates required?  Monthly?   Other?

Response:  FDA expects the Offeror to explain in their technical proposal how often the database is updated.

Question  6:  Regarding Paragraph III.2.9 – would FDA be willing to execute a non-disclosure agreement  before release of an offeror’s data dictionary.

Response:  Due to the time constraints associated with this procurement, FDA would need to hold off signing a  non-disclosure agreement.  However, after award FDA would be agreeable to submitting the non-disclosure agreement to our legal department for review and approval prior to signing.

Question 7:  (A)  Regarding Paragraph VI.1.B. – Short term trial subscription at no cost. What are the criteria for choosing vendors for this trial?  
(B)	Would a single, best and final vendor be chosen or would a number of vendors provide this trail subscription?  
(C)	 Because of the complexity of the data and the potential queries that FDA might want to perform, training and support will be required.  Would the FDA consider less expensive options such as access to a smaller, representative sample of the data? 
(D)	Prior to the trial training session, would the FDA be willing to submit the sample queries that they would like to obtain?  This would allow more focused training.

Response:  (A)  The minimum mandatory requirements are the criteria for choosing vendors for the trial subscription. 
(B)	Those vendors who meet the minimum mandatory requirements will be selected to provide a trial subscription.  This could be a number of vendors.  
(C)	As stated in the RFP, FDA is only interested in accessing the full, currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant, out-patient and patient level prescription data via secure Internet or network-based methods to a maximum of four FDA researchers for the trial subscription for evaluation purposes. 
(D)	The training should address how to access, navigate, and retrieve reports and/or downloads from the product.  Offerors should be prepared to demonstrate during training how the product can be used to address queries concerning trend and volume in drug utilization, and how to characterize that information by demographic factors.”

<DESC>Q & A for RFQ DCCA-050012

THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER RFQ-DCCA-050012 “Audio/Visual Services.”

1. Who is the incumbent contractor for this work?  Well, there are 4 edit houses NSF has        been using:  Henninger, EFX, MVI, and Interface.

2.  Is there an incumbent contractor and existing/expiring BPA currently in place? If so, who is the incumbent contractor and what is the annual dollar value of the latest year of record for that BPA? There is no BPA currently in place.  Last year there were BPA’s set up with 4 local edit houses – MVI, Henninger, EFX and Interface.  The cap on these BPA’s was $25,000.

3.  Regarding the way the FFP CLINs are stated in the RFQ, is there any relative annual quantification of workload that can NSF can provide? This sounds like an indefinite quantity type of requirement.  Can we just bid labor categories and rates for the basic BPA and then negotiate Task Orders on an as needed basis? This is for indefinite quantity and rate cards are acceptable.

4.  Are there any existing production and editing facilities and/or equipment at all located on-site at NSF (e.g., the RFQ references AVID), or is the contractor expected to provide virtually all productions, post-production, and editing facilities and equipment off-site? NSF does have 2 AVID’s on site but we are looking for full post-production off-site as well.

5.   How many BPA’s per this SOL? Probably four facilities.

<DESC>Q & A FOR RFQ DCCA-050015

THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER RFQ-DCCA-050015 “Transcription Services”

1.	Do you have an estimate as to how many transcript pages per year will be generated from this contract? Possibly 20.  Hard to say right now.

2.	Can you provide the name of the current contractor?  Word Wizard.

3.	Can you provide the prices that are currently in place?  $3.50/page.

4.	Can you provide the volume of the different types of work? From one interview on tape to 1 hour scientific lecture.

5.	Can you provide the turnaround time frames you are looking for in the quote?  1-4 days.

6.	What percentage of the pages need to be time coded?  The time code jobs are usually for individual interviews and we would need time code to correspond with each answer on tape.  So in that case, the entire job would need to be time coded and that can run anywhere from 35-50 pages.

7.	Will the tapes or CD’s be delivered or mailed to the vendor or does the vendor have to pick up the tapes at the NSF?  All materials will be couriered from NSF to vendor.

8.	Does the vendor have to return the tapes?  It is preferable to have items returned, but not essential.

9.	What is the required turnaround time from the moment the vendor will be in possession of the tapes?  If it varies by project what is the turnaround requirement in the majority of the cases?  2-4 days.

10.	Is there a formatting template the vendor should go by?  150 words/page, 24 pt., Courier New is fine.

11.	Would all transcriptions be in English? Are there any foreign languages involved?  English only.

12.	What are the anticipated yearly hours of recordings or number of pages to be transcribed?  We would probably need at least one a month and they can vary from 35 pages to 200.

13.	Would all transcription topics be scientific in nature?  Yes, most likely all scientific in nature.
14.	The solicitation references a cost per page.  Would you entertain an alternative pricing approach such as a cost per hour for transcription?  Sure.

15.	The amount of transcription needed on a weekly/monthly/annual basis?  Specifically, the number of lines or pages that are transcribed now and if this current solicitation meets or exceeds that amount?  Maybe 1 or 2 a month.  Jobs can range from 1-hour lecture to 20 minute interview.

16.	There are 3 types of transcription stated in the solicitation.  Do we have to bid on all 3 facets or can we bid on one?  What type of transcription is required from a CD/DVD? Videotape?  All three need to be met.  Word doc transcription either with or without time code, depending on job.  CD/DVD videotape would be everything you hear.

17.	Specify turnaround associated with next day services – can you please be more specific?  Is the NSF looking for next day service (i.e., pick up from your facility by certain time and return by certain time on the next day?)  How quickly the vendor can transcribe and email the job to me on quick notice.   What charges are involved  with next day turnaround?

18.	Audio cassette transcription – are these standard cassettes? Micro cassettes? Mini cassettes? How many per week are issued?  Mostly standard audio cassettes.  You would get them on an as needed basis.  We don’t have anything we need done weekly.

19.	Are there any special needs with regard to formatting the end product?  Are they simply transcribed in a Times New Roman, 12 pt. Font, or is there a specific format to be followed?  No particular format to follow.

20.	What is the subject content of the transcription?  Lectures?  Research?  Is it verbatim typing?  Scientific lectures, interviews with researchers about their work, etc.

21.	Are there any dictators who possess dialects which may impede the speed of transcription?  Not to my knowledge.

22.	Can the work be performed off-site or must it be done at the NSF facility in Arlington?  Off-site preferred.

23.	The solicitation states that that all transcripts should be sent via email to NSF.  Is a hard copy required to be sent to NSF in addition to the email?  Are any other deliverables required; i.e. diskettes, manuscript, etc?  Email is preferred method.  Hard copy and other formats upon request

24.	The statement on page 3 or 4 which states, “Please specify costs associated with next day services, tape transfer and time code.” I know what next day service is, please define further tape transfer and time code?  Transferring from VHS to format used to transcribe (audio cassette).  Sometimes tapes have time code burned in and will need transcript to have time code included for reference and need to know if there is additional cost for such service.

25	There are several programs which create CD’s, which system does NSF use? (for example Olympus, Court Smart, FTR Gold, etc.)  Never received CD’s.  Do not know.

26.	Based on current workload, what is the projected average (per week or per month) of audio cassette tapes, of CD’s, of video tapes and of DVD’s? Either by estimated time of each or estimated transcript pages of each?  Possibly 2 per month.

27.	What is the normal delivery turnaround time for completion of the transcripts? (i.e., 10 workdays) rush: 1 day; normal 2-4 days.

28.	How many requests for expedited deliveries are anticipated? (i.e., next-day delivery or any other expedited deliveries sooner than 10-day).  Will need all within 2-4 days max.

29.	What printed page format is required? (i.e., number of text lines per page, margins at top and bottom and left and right-hand margins); and what size print font is required? (i.e., courier 12, etc) Courier 12 is fine.  150 lines per page approx.

30.	How are tapes, CD’s, etc. received by vendor doing transcription?  NSF couriers job to vendor for transcription.

31.	What is payment procedure? (i.e., direct deposit or check) and how long is payment from time of submission of complete transcription job and invoice?  As a small business, are we permitted to invoice bi-weekly as with other federal contracts?  Payment is electronic bank payment and government agencies have 1-3 months to pay.

32.	I am a new bidder/contractor.  I need a better understanding of how the bidding process works.  I understand that apparently this solicitation was previously bided on and a contract awarded.  I need to know the specifics and a ballpark figure of the award amount so this will give me a better understanding where my prices fall at.  Need to know quantity, Unit (Year), Unit price etc.  From my understanding to release information pertaining to award contract bids would fall under the Freedom of Information Act.  We had a blanket purchase agreement last year of $2,000.  Last year the contractor provided 13 transcripts.  I can see that growing to possibly 20 this year.

33.	I live in New Jersey.  Is it mandatory that you live within the radius of 30 minutes of  the area?  What is the reasoning behind this?  Can I still bid on this solicitation/Contract even though I do not live in the area?  In the area is ideal because our office does not have to pay courier charges, but we are charged for Fed. Ex.

34.	How will the process work in transferring Audio cassettes, videotapes, and CD/DVD?  Will documents be transcribed on computer and then email to you or will documents be printed out and in final form then via email or overnight UPS to you?  I believe that all transcripts were done via computer.  All documents were emailed to NSF.  Nothing was ever sent UPS.

35.	Once the contract has been awarded, will specifics be given when documents are submitted, time frame, deadlines I must meet etc ?  This service is on an “as needed” basis.  When jobs arise, we will call to inform the contractor of job and all specifics including deadlines.

36.	Need to know the quantity/amount of work involved in this project?  Can one person handle this amount of workload?  The projects are mostly scientific interviews and lectures.  I just don’t know if one person could handle it all.

<DESC>The following are responses to questions posed by interested offerors in response to the subject solicitation.  Offerors are advised that these questions refer to all three parts of the solicitation  that were posted on FedBizOpps:  RS-HR-05-363, 
RS-HR-05-363-1, and RS-HR-05-363-2. RS-HR-05-363-I is a duplicate of RS-HR-05-363-1 and should be disregarded.  Please be advised that the closing date for questions has passed, so no additional questions will be entertained.  The closing date for receipt of proposals has not been extended and is 3:30 p.m. on January 7, 2005. 

1.  QUESTION:  Does the NRC believe there is a need to provide a full-time project manager or is the need for full-time availability (the person needs to be available to plan OD interventions and training on an as needed basis)?

RESPONSE: The NRC needs a person to be available to schedule OD sessions with its OD practitioners on short notice.  If the contractor can assure the availability of OD facilitators on a  short notice whenever NRC requires OD services, NRC would not require a full-time person to handle the OD effort.  What NRC wants to avoid is getting a voice message or being unable to reach a contractor representative to set up an OD session and not receiving an answer for days.  Sometimes the offices will call and request for an immediate response as to availability of an OD facilitator.

2.  QUESTION:  Is this person required to be on-site?

RESPONSE: The person will be required to perform the OD interventions on NRC’s site.

3.  QUESTION:  Is there a current contract performing this work?  

RESPONSE: No.

4.  QUESTION:  Is a non-contract incumbent currently performing this work?  

RESPONSE: No.

5.  QUESTION:  Who held the last contract?  

RESPONSE: Resolution Dynamics held a similar contract that provided for organizational development activities and other training courses.

6.  QUESTION:  What was the dollar amount of the last contract, with a breakdown per line item? 

RESPONSE: This information can be requested from NRC’s Public Document Room, telephone number (301)4737.  The contract number is NRC-38-00-281.

7.  QUESTION:  Regarding the OD facilitator's certification requirements: Absent formal certificates or licenses, will the senior facilitator certification requirements for this solicitation be satisfied by a doctor of philosophy degree in political communications that includes a dissertation in crisis communications, and a masters degree in management that includes successfully completed courses in organizational theory and behavior, managerial psychology and group dynamics-combined with more than three decades of experience providing OD learning, coaching and leadership interventions to Federal Government agencies and extensive experience teaching OD intervention theory and practice at the graduate school level?

RESPONSE: Yes.

8.  QUESTION:  Please correct me if I'm wrong: - As I understand the meaning of the Solicitation, the "technical approach" of our proposals is to be spelled out in the slides of the Oral Presentation (rather than in narrative form in the Written Presentation).  (It is understood that the Written Presentation includes the Oral Presentation slides and supporting
documentation of resumes, past performance, past client surveys, work break-down, etc., and that the Oral Presentation will address each of these in addition to our technical approach.)

RESPONSE:   The first part of you understanding is not correct.  The second part of your understanding is partly correct.  Please refer to Topics for Oral Presentation and Written Presentation for details on the information to be included in the Oral Presentation and Written Supporting Documentation.   

9. QUESTION:   If my understanding of Question 1 is correct, will NRC use the Written Presentations to select finalists to deliver Oral Presentations? 

RESPONSE: No.  The NRC intends to conduct Oral Presentations with all offerors and narrow its selection down to those individuals who are technically qualified based on their oral presentations.

10.  QUESTION:  Please confirm the two uses of the term "risk," in the following:  In RS-HR-05-363, paragraph C.1.1, the Background discusses "coaching for specific projects, such as the licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository, crisis and risk communications..."  (nuclear-related risk?) and in RS-HR-05-363-1, Part III.A.1 ORAL PRESENTATION, "Your discussion should include, at a minimum...  risk mitigation tools and techniques..."  (financial risk? addressing client investment, results and return on investment?)

RESPONSE:  Risk is an emotional issue.  When dealing with emotional issues, the speaker must maintain a calm, cool, and unemotional manner.   They must be in control of themselves and stay on the message.   Coaching on specific topics relate to conducting public meetings where the audience is sometime hostile and disruptive.  Coaching helps the presenters at a public meeting maintain balance and conduct the meeting in a professional and informative manner.  Risk mitigation tools and techniques are the processes and procedures used to ensure that the contract requirements are met in accordance with the SOW.

11. QUESTION:  The RFP refers to instruments "such as" the MBTI and 360-Degree Surveys.  Are these the specific instruments that are required?

RESPONSE: No.  They are examples of effective tools we have used in the past.

12. QUESTION:  Will OD facilitators whose experience is with Federal Government agencies whose focus is not scientific or related to engineering be acceptable?

RESPONSE:  Although the SOW calls for experience in scientific/engineering environments similar to NRC’s, the panel will evaluate the OD facilitators specific experience on a case by case basis.

13. QUESTION:  The RFP states that the contractor will be required to provide the PO with an OD facilitator roster within 20 days of contract award C.3.6.5.  However, it seems that the written presentation requires submission of the credentials of Senior Facilitators and Junior Facilitators at the time of proposal submission.  Please clarify.

RESPONSE: Credentials of proposed OD practitioners are required when proposal is submitted.  After award, the contractor’s list of OD practitioners shall be provided to the NRC Project Manager.  

14. QUESTION:  The evaluation factors include the offeror's staffing pattern.  However, considering the statements related to scheduling of interventions (sporadic, uneven work pattern), other than the PM, it doesn't seem possible to determine any other full-time staff positions or to propose, in the absence of specific examples, "staffing projects at the task level". Please clarify.	

RESPONSE:  NRC would like to know if the OD facilitators are full-time employees or are consultants and what relationship the contractor has with the facilitator.  NRC has to be able to rely on the availability of proposed facilitators to be provide the services requested.

15.  QUESTION:  Is there an assumption that the selected provider has a history with NRC or is at least very familiar with nuclear related issues and other NRC-specific issues?

RESPONSE: There is no assumption that the selected contractor has a history with NRC.  What is important is that the contractor (facilitator) be able to provide OD services on numerous matters to improve performance and enhance the organization which could involve nuclear related issues or NRC-specific issues.

16.  QUESTION:  Does NRC cover the cost of instrumentation (i.e., Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, 360 Degree Surveys)?  If not, how do we account for the cost of these materials in our proposal?  These instruments can add significantly to the cost of delivery and total cost is dependent on the number of sessions and participants.

RESPONSE: NRC does cover the cost of tools used.  The contractor has to contact the provider of such tools, obtain the cost, and submit a proposal to the NRC so that the cost can be negotiated and a Work Order Letter can be issued.  Offerors shall propose a separate line item for other direct costs in their proposal.

17.  QUESTION:  In the past, was there a standard/off-the-shelf group process for sessions using, for example, the MBTI or 360 Degree Survey, or were services customized based on the specific group of participants or agency goals and challenges?  

RESPONSE: In the past, services were generally customized.

18.  QUESTION:  The RFP indicates OD interventions are to be delivered to five locations (Rockville, MD; King of Prussia, PA; Atlanta, GA; Lisle, IL; and Arlington, TX).  Do we need to propose the specific trainers who will be providing the interventions in each location or can we provide a pool of trainers who will be available to provide the training in any one of the locations?  

RESPONSE: OD practitioners may be located in the Washington metropolitan area or in any of the four regions.

19.  QUESTION:   Did the incumbent have trainers located in each area so travel was not a factor?  

RESPONSE: No.  In the previous similar contract, OD facilitators from the Washington metropolitan area traveled to the region where the OD services were required.

20.  QUESTION:  Does an estimate of travel cost for the entire program need to be included?  If so, how do we estimate the cost without knowing how much travel may be involved for each delivery? 

RESPONSE: Offerors shall include travel estimates for the entire effort.  Estimated travel costs for each region and headquarters, if not located in the metropolitan area, multiplied by the number of estimated days for each trip.  It is expected that an OD practitioner who is not local, will construct the OD effort to spend an entire day, rather than on an hourly basis, based on the need to manage the travel dollars.  (Travel is cost reimbursable, but the travel estimate should be based on the Federal Travel Regulations.) 

21.  QUESTION:  Is project management to be discussed in general for the whole program or is it to be discussed with respect to each individual OD intervention?  

RESPONSE: Project Management should be addressed for the overall contract effort.

22.  QUESTION:  If project management is to be addressed for each individual OD component, could you be more specific with the actual categories (i.e., team building, employee surveys, process re-engineering, etc.)?  

RESPONSE: N/A (See 21 above.)

23.  QUESTION:  Do you also want a description of project management for the six (6) stages of Instructional System Design (BEEN) Course Development and Training?  If not, could you provide some more details on what are you looking for us to demonstrate with respect to these six stages?

RESPONSE:   No.  The six stages were intended to help offerors sort out what is involved in an OD effort.  

24.  QUESTION:  Is it assumed that sufficient preparation time for each intervention is included within the 800 hours?  

RESPONSE: Yes.

25.  QUESTION:  In general and in the past, was it preferred that each service be (1) customized or; (2) off-the-shelf or at least based on an off-the-shelf product?

RESPONSE: OD services in the past were generally customized. 

26.  QUESTION:  Does the "800 hours" of OD intervention time include labor hours associated with custom instructional design and consulting hours associated with "performing preliminary needs assessment," "diagnosis" and "evaluation" tasks?  Are these assessment/diagnostic tasks still a requirement of the solicitation?  They are not included in subsequent updates.

RESPONSE:   The 800 hours covers the estimate number of OD interventions that will take place during any given year during the life of the contract.  These requirements will exist throughout the life of the contract.   However, this estimate was provided as advisory and should not be the sole basis for proposal development.

27.  QUESTION:  How many parts to the response are there?  I've counted three: Oral Presentation, Written Technical Approach and Cost Proposal.  Please confirm requirements for submission.
									
RESPONSE: Actually there are four parts to the response.  The fourth one in addition to those mentioned above is the Representations and Certifications.  Each part must be addressed clearly and concisely.

28.  QUESTION:  What time on Jan. 7th are responses due to the NRC?  No date was provided, except for the closing date and time for questions.

RESPONSE: It was stated in the synopsis that responses are due no later than 3:30 p.m. eastern standard time on January 7, 2004. 

29.  QUESTION:  What level employees will participate in OD interventions?

RESPONSE: The level of employee will depend on the type of OD undertaken.  It could be the entire staff of a branch, a mix of supervisors and managers, supervisors and managers, office directors and their direct reports, etc.  (There is a wide variety of combinations that could possibly request OD services.)

30.  QUESTION:  Approximately how many 360 Degree Surveys/Feedback Tools are required?  What core topic areas are required for 360 Degree Feedback?  Would NRC like a customized feedback tool or an "off-the-shelf" tool?

RESPONSE: The 360 Degree Survey we have used was an “off-the-shelf” electronic version.  NRC estimates that no more than three such surveys would be conducted, if any.

31.  QUESTION:  How much advanced notice will be provided to the selected contractor when NRC determines that an OD intervention is required?  Will a master schedule be provided or is this the "OD Session Schedule" that the contractor is to develop?

RESPONSE:   The time of the advance notice to the contractor will depend on the urgency of the request from the NRC requesting office.  It could be immediately, a week, two weeks or even longer.  There is no master schedule provided by the NRC.   The contractor shall prepare a schedule once an OD session is requested and shall maintain the schedule as new sessions are added.  Such a schedule shall reflect the hours spent and the number of people participating in the OD effort. 

32.  What is the ceiling amount for this contract?

RESPONSE: The ceiling amount will be negotiated with the successful offeror.

33.  How many "key personnel" are allowed to attend the Oral  Presentation?

RESPONSE: As many as the offeror deems necessary.

34.  QUESTION:  How has MBTI been applied at the NRC in the past?

RESPONSE: The MBTI instrument has been used in OD interventions that involved team building.

35.  QUESTION: How many years of experience are considered "Senior Facilitator" versus "Junior Facilitator"?

RESPONSE: A senior facilitator is one with more than five years of effective OD experience.  A junior facilitator is one with less than five years of experience, but has still been effective.  It is expected that the more senior facilitator will be better suited to provide OD services to NRC management. 

36.  QUESTION:  Is the current incumbent Resolution Dynamics, Inc.  If not, who is the incumbent and is this information publicly available via FOIA?  What are procedures for obtaining such information from the NRC?

RESPONSE: There is no incumbent contractor for this effort.  Resolutions Dynamics was the contractor for a similar effort which involved organizational development.  See Question No. 6.

37.  QUESTION:  With regard to cost, will a daily rate be accepted by the NRC and a fixed price for classroom instruction?	
RESPONSE:   Offerors should propose an hourly rate for OD Interventions.  It is not expected that classroom instruction will be employed in an OD intervention at NRC.  There may be some teaching aspects with regard to coaching, but usually NRC presenters at public meetings on specific topics have prepared slides and they are practiced in class and improved upon through actual presentation scenarios.

38.  QUESTION: How much travel will be required to fulfill this contract?

RESPONSE: Please refer to Section C.3, Scope of Work for the response to this question.

39.  QUESTION:  How should full descriptions of ODCs be included?

RESPONSE: Other direct costs should be described in whatever way the offeror deems appropriate, but in a straight forward manner so that NRC can clearly understand what other direct costs include.

40.  QUESTION:  How should subcontractors be integrated into the proposal effort?

RESPONSE: It is totally up to the offeror how he or she plans to use subcontractors for this effort.

41. QUESTION:  The SOW states that approximately 30 coaching and OD sessions were conducted in Fiscal Year 2003.  How many individuals participated in the 30 sessions?

RESPONSE: Participation ranged from 10 to 15 individuals per session.

42.  QUESTION:  How many individuals - non-supervisory, supervisory, and managerial - does NRC anticipate will be involved in contracted OD consulting services?

RESPONSE: This information is unknown at this time.  It depends of the needs of the agency.

43.  QUESTION:  When the NRC has required outside support for OD services, who has been contracted to provide these services during the past 3 years?  Will any previous contractor be competing for this project?

RESPONSE: Resolutions Dynamics was the previous contractor for similar services.  They have not been eliminated from competing on this project.

44.  QUESTION:  What is the greatest number of participants that the NRC anticipates may be involved in any one OD session?  What is the typical number of participants that the NRC anticipates would be involved in any single OD session conducted at NRC locations?

RESPONSE: The greatest number of OD participants in any one session would be no more than 30 people.  A more typical range is ten to fifteen participants.

45.  QUESTION:  How many training workshops does the NRC anticipate across all locations this year?  Approximately, how many participants would attend each workshop?

RESPONSE:  OD sessions are not considered to be workshops.  See Question No. 37.  

46.  QUESTION:  How many coaching sessions does the NRC anticipate across all locations this year?  Approximately, how many individuals would participate in the coaching sessions?

RESPONSE: This information is not available at this time.  However, offerors are advised that the Government’s estimate of 800 hours per year includes the coaching sessions for the regions and headquarters locations.
 

47.   QUESTION:  What is the time frame in which oral presentations will be conducted? Will the NRC coordinate with offerors to schedule oral presentations or assign presentation dates and times?  How many offerors does the NRC anticipate scheduling for oral presentations?

RESPONSE: Oral presentations will be conducted within one week of the closing date of the solicitation.  The NRC will assign presentation dates and times to offerors.  We have no idea how many offerors we will schedule for oral presentations at this time. 

48.  QUESTION:   I want to be clear as to what you're looking for in our proposal.  Since your organization will be using these OD services on an as needed basis, it is therefore difficult describe what we would do.  Operating from that assumption, you are therefore looking to hear about past experience of our organization and personnel, current capability and our broader methodology to ensure success.  Is this correct?

RESPONSE: Please refer to the Topics for Oral Presentations and Written Supportive Documentation for details of the information required to be presented in your offer.

49.  QUESTION:  Going along with the above assumption, the cost proposal would therefore be 800 hours times our hourly rate?  Is that correct?

RESPONSE: The 800 hours is the Government’s estimate.  This is simply advisory for estimating purpose and should not be used as the sole basis for preparing your cost proposal.

50.  QUESTION:  How many people in your whole organization?

RESPONSE: There are approximately 1,500 employees in Headquarters and 1,500 in the four regions.

51.  QUESTION:  Are you looking for a certain sized company as far as personnel goes? How many people do you believe is needed for the work as it comes up?

RESPONSE: We are looking for a small business firm who has a proven track record in providing OD interventions with a high percentage of customer satisfaction.  One OD facilitator is generally sufficient.  Should more than one OD facilitator be necessary for a complicated OD session, NRC will determine the practicality of that situation on its merits.  

52. QUESTION:  Is there an incumbent with whom you will be considering for the work?

RESPONSE:   There is no incumbent contractor. 

53.  QUESTION:  Will you be posting the other questions along with their answers?

RESPONSE: Yes, via this amendment to the solicitation.

54.  QUESTION:  In fiscal Year 2003 approximately 30 coaching and OD, sessions were conducted.  What was the length (actual contact hours) of the sessions?

RESPONSE: In 2003, an OD session averaged 3 days, spread out over a period of time with hourly sessions. 

55.  QUESTION:  Are online assessments and surveys acceptable for this solicitation?

RESPONSE: Yes.  The 360 Degree Survey, for example, is an on-line survey.    

56.  QUESTION:  Will assessment include the performance of existing team structures?

RESPONSE:   The use of “assessment” is misunderstood.  Assessment, as used here, means meeting with the manager requesting the OD service to determine what the focus of the OD should be.
					
57.   QUESTION:  Will the OD interventions include working with intact teams in a schedule of activities to be determined by the needs of that team? (This form of just-in-time leadership and organizational development results in more customized solutions that can compliment and deepen the concepts or tools taught in standardized course work.)

RESPONSE: It depends on the needs of the requesting office.  When coaching for public meetings occurs, an intact team could be used or just the presenter could be coached.  The requesting office decides which format it wants to use.

58.  QUESTION:  May we submit for your consideration the credentials of foreign nationals with work privileges in the United States and considerable consulting experience with the U.S. Government?

RESPONSE: No.  Contractors must be citizens of the United States to be cleared for access to the NRC facilities.

59.  QUESTION:  In the cost proposal, shall we submit a separate line item for project management?

RESPONSE: Yes.

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.

The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must:

6	          Project Descriptions and Profile

                                   Both Croatia and Romania plan to join the European Union (EU) by 2007.  In an effort to meet EU infrastructure requirements and handle increased cargo and tourism, civil aviation has become an important developmental priority for both countries’ governments.  

Croatian airports are 55% owned by the government, with the remaining 45% split between different levels of local authority.  While Croatia’s airports currently have sufficient infrastructure to handle existing traffic, two of the country’s airports, Zagreb and Dubrovnik, have forecast increased cargo and passenger traffic and thus have expansion plans.  

The Zagreb Airport, Croatia’s largest airport, handled 1.3 million passengers in 2003, a 10% increase from the year before.  In 2004, Zagreb registered 1 million passengers by late summer.  Month-to-month forecasts estimate the Zagreb Airport will handle close to 2 million passengers in 2004.  The Zagreb airport is actively marketing itself as a regional hub for long-haul international flights and is exploring opportunities with major air carriers, including a direct flight from Atlanta to Zagreb with Delta Airlines.  In anticipation of Croatia’s accession to the EU and the resulting increased passenger and cargo traffic, Zagreb Airport is planning to construct a new passenger terminal.  The airport is interested in a USTDA-funded feasibility study to examine the viability of such an undertaking.  Construction of the new terminal is estimated to cost $200 million.  

The Dubrovnik Airport provides access to Croatia’s most popular tourist destination on the Dalmatian Coast.  Airport management estimates 2004 passenger numbers will mark a 25% increase over 2003.  Much of the increase in passenger traffic is attributed to tourism growth in the area.  In addition, over 50% of the hotels in the area are undergoing major renovations, making the area more amenable to larger numbers of visitors, restaurants, and facilities, which are likely to draw additional visitors.  The Dubrovnik Airport is interested in an aviation master plan that would examine this growth and assess the need for additional cargo and passenger terminals.  

Timisoara is the second busiest airport in Romania.  It is close to Hungary and Serbia and over the past few years has played an increasingly important role in serving as a regional hub.  Because of this, passenger and cargo traffic has risen dramatically causing overcrowding and unnecessary delays.  The airport plans to build a new cargo terminal and a new passenger terminal.  In addition, the airport plans to install new ground surveillance equipment, build hotels, and develop a business center.

The Cluj International Airport, located in the Transylvania region of Romania, has experienced massive increases in traffic.  It currently ranks third among Romanian airports in traffic volume.  The Government of Romania has earmarked funding to build a new cargo terminal, lengthen the runways, and install a new visual approach system.  A feasibility study is needed before implementation of these projects can begin.

In addition, the Contractor would also be asked to evaluate potential project opportunities at the Bacau International Airport.  USTDA has been asked to explore a number of development options currently planned for the airport.  

This DM will investigate each project at a deeper level, investigate other potential projects, and assess their eligibility for USTDA funding.

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA intends to commission a DM to travel to Turkey to investigate underground gas storage and liquefied natural gas (LNG) opportunities for possible USTDA assistance.  The consultant will be expected to travel to Ankara for at least one week to meet with the Ministry of Energy, BOTAS (the State Oil and Gas Company), the Turkish Petroleum Company, U.S. companies and U.S. Embassy officials.
Prior to Turkey's severe economic difficulties in 2001, the country's energy consumption had been outstripping its energy production, making it a rapidly growing energy importer.  Turkey will require billions of dollars worth of investment in coming years in its energy sector and will need to develop different energy sources to meet demand.  This will be especially crucial if Turkey receives a date for EU accession talks, and moves towards membership in the EU.
In September 2004, U.S. Secretary of Energy Abraham and Turkish Minister of Energy Guler met and discussed some of the potential areas for cooperation in the energy sector as each country seeks to diversify its sources of energy supply.  In addition to continued support of the BTC pipeline and of Turkey as part of the East-West Energy corridor, the possibilities they discussed included gas storage, LNG facilities, nuclear power, and renewables.
In 2002, USTDA funded a DM on Underground Gas Storage in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.  As a result of the DM, a project in Georgia was funded by USTDA and the study was recently completed.  At the time, there was interest in Turkey in underground gas storage but there was little capital or investor interest in such projects, especially since Turkey was interested in gas storage for emergency purposes only.  There is now renewed interest in underground gas storage in Turkey, as many of the gas pipeline projects have been or soon will be realized, with the result that Turkey is becoming a major hub for international gas transportation.  Also, Turkey has recently renegotiated several of its gas purchase contracts to allow for follow-on sale of gas to Europe.  With the higher gas prices that the winter season commands, Turkey may well be able to earn revenue from the sale of gas.  Turkey is also in the process of privatizing some of the current gas contracts, which may result in additional investment from the private sector.

Two major Turkish underground storage sites are currently in the early implementation stages, both slated for completion in 2005.  One will be located in a sub-sea aquifer under the Sea of Marmara, and a second will be constructed in the salt deposits south of Aksaray, in Central Turkey.  However, neither project is of a scale to accommodate more than basic emergency supplies (less than 10% of the country’s imports).
As more gas in the Caucasus and Central Asia is developed for export, Turkey will be become an increasingly important hub in transporting this gas via pipelines or in the form of LNG.  There is interest in developing more LNG facilities in Turkey for transshipment of gas to other countries, including the United States.  There has been discussion about developing a facility at Ceyhan, a deep-water port, which would permit large tankers to load the LNG for transport to the U.S. and other world markets.  Turkey currently has two LNG terminals, one at Istanbul (owned by BOTAS) and one at Aliaga (privately owned) near Izmir.
