<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a requirement to a natural resource contractor to perform baseline (pre-treatment) and post-treatment vegetation monitoring at selected experimental field sites in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California.  These inventories will consist of using scientifically accepted sampling methods and procedures for a) collecting systematic soil samples; and b) estimating vegetative stand survival, cover, density, frequency, biomass, and diversity (native and exotic species) on seeded and/or planted riparian floodplain sites along major western river systems (Rio Grande, Pecos, Colorado, Canadian) that are infested with saltcedar (Tamarix spp.).  Additional sites in California address experimental revegetation studies in the Central San Joaquin Valley on cropland recently retired from irrigation.  The contractor may be required to provide the labor necessary to simultaneously execute the required services at numerous locations while also anticipating that other sites (mainly western United States) may be added during the term of the contract.  Any small business firm that believes it can execute the pending requirement is encouraged to obtain a copy of the Request for Proposal from the Contracting Officer.  All contractors requesting a copy of the Request for Proposal within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of the synopsis period will be forwarded a copy of the Request for Proposal.  Please note that based on how Fed-Biz Ops posts a synopsis, the "Post Date" is the first day of the synopsis publication, and the "Original Response Date/Current Response Date" equates to the expiration date of the synopsis, not the due date of any proposal.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning.  Responses should include the firm's business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard:  $6 Million for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541620.

<ARCHDATE>02022008
<CONTACT>Dale Wilkerson Contracting Officer 6626804009     dale_wilkerson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking contractors to remove vegetative fuel accumulations in support of the national Wildland Urban Interface hazardous fuels reduction program on the Natchez Trace Parkway.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is 450-miles long, and runs from Natchez, Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee.  Over the past several years there has been an accumulation of downed limbs, trees, brush, etc. in many locations along the Parkway.  This material has become "vegetative fuel," capable of feeding wildfires.  Since the Parkway runs adjacent to non-federal lands, both developed and undeveloped, the threat of private property loss should a fire erupt is potentially very great.  Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to mitigate the vegetative fuel accumulation in the identified project areas to lessen the risk of losses due to wildfire, and to remove concentrations of damaged and dead vegetative fuels as a preventative measure.  The contractor(s) will be required to remove all dead and downed woody material and either haul away to an approved disposal site or chip smaller debris.  No standing trees will be cut and stump removal is not a part of this project.  There are three project areas included in this contract and contractors may bid on any or all of the three areas.  Note that multiple awards may result from this solicitation.  Project Area #1 is located near Ridgeland Mississippi in Madison County, with approx. 50 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $50,000 to $100,000.  Project Area #2 is located near Collinwood Tennessee in Wayne County, with approx. 115 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $100,000 to $150,000.  Project Area #3 is located near Cherokee Alabama in Lauderdale county, with approx. 52 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude of $50,000 to $100,000.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside being conducted as an Invitation for Bids.  The applicable NAICS code is 113310 with an associated size standard of 500 employees.  This notice is not the solicitation.  The solicitation package will be available on or about February 20, 2007 and will be issued as an IFB electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  Bidders desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center.  Bidders wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at http://ideas.nbc.gov.  This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents.  No other notifications will be sent.
