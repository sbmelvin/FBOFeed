Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval on a brand name only basis is for the maintenance of Network Appliance systems. The use of a bran name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/DSS has identified the Network Appliance products as akey component of DSS's file storage management on OpenNet and ClassNet. The Network Appliance systems currently provide storage for over 1400 OpenNet users. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet DSS's requirements for file storage as a key component of the Department's cohesive network infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. Continuous outbreaks of human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses from infected birds have occurred since late 2003 in Asia, Europe and/or Africa. Ongoing influenza surveillance reveals that H5N1 viruses are endemic in bird populations and suggests that continued human exposure is likely. As a result, the threat of a pandemic caused by highly pathogenic influenza viruses continues.
	
The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. DHHS has undertaken a portfolio matrix approach to modernize and diversify influenza vaccines and to expand domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing surge capacity. Specific measures were implemented that support advanced development of cell-based influenza vaccines and antigen-optimization approaches for pandemic influenza vaccines, stockpiling of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and building of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing infrastructure.  
	  
	DHHS now seeks to leverage recombinant-based technologies to decrease the timeline of vaccine production in response to a newly emerged pandemic influenza strain. The timeline for the availability of egg- and cell-based inactivated pandemic influenza vaccines in the U.S. is estimated at 20-23 weeks post-pandemic onset, which may be towards the end of a first pandemic wave. Recombinant-based influenza vaccines, which may not be dependent on pandemic influenza virus reference strain availability and the production and calibration of potency assay reagents needed for inactivated influenza vaccines, may be available 8 to 12 weeks post-pandemic onset. The effect of vaccination combined with influenza antiviral drugs and community mitigation measures may delay the peak incidence of pandemic influenza disease and reduce mortality and morbidity during a severe pandemic.        
           
The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, contemplates single or multiple contract awards to develop recombinant influenza vaccines based on hemagglutinin genes or proteins (plasmid DNA, virus-vectors, peptides, subunit proteins and virus-like particles) and leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds include clinical investigation lot manufacturing, scale-up process development, clinical evaluation, validation of manufacturing process systems and manufacturing facility concept design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or have partnerships with companies owning vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Other requirements for offerors include the following: (1) a completed final report of Phase I clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity and cross-reactivity or cross-neutralization of antigenically drifted influenza strains using a recombinant influenza  vaccine (2) written evidence of firm commitment to establish and maintain the necessary facilities in the U.S. to manufacture bulk and final container recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine with a manufacturing surge capacity of 50 million doses within six months, (3) a manufacturing production cycle that  permits recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine lot release within 12 weeks of a pandemic declaration. (4) a comprehensive development plan and timeline for U.S licensure of a recombinant pandemic-like influenza vaccine.
               
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be  three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-BARDA-07-06 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about September 14, 2007. Proposals will be due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP-DHHS-BARDA-07-06, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of March 2008.

Get an overview of the fundamental concepts of electronic protection, or electronic counter-countermeasures, beginning with a description of basic electronic warfare concepts, including noise jamming, range/velocity deception, and on-board and off-board angle deception, supported by laboratory demonstration of noise and digital radio frequency memory generated electronic attack waveforms;
Explore the methodology for prioritizing EA threats as well as examples of current threat EA capabilities. Examine conceptual descriptions of more than 60 EP techniques, that address both denial (noise) and deceptive (coherent) EA techniques, primarily emphasizing current EP techniques but also including legacy EP designs found in fielded systems;
Explore in more detail EP regarding adaptive array processing and digital beamforming; space-time-adaptive processing; counter-DRFM techniques; counter-angle deception (inverse gain, towed decoys, terrain bounce, Cross Pol and Cross Eye) techniques; and image-domain synthetic aperture radar EP algorithms. Examine special topics including low-probability of intercept waveforms, ballistic-missile defense radar applications, EP testing and high-power microwave susceptibility;

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding to Develop Intelligence Functional Services (INTEL-FS) Spiral I Initial Operating Capability
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-12401-INTEL-FS
<RESPDATE>100207

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of the INTEL-FS Spiral I ? Initial Operating Capability.

This project is included in Project 2005/OIS03063 under the Capability Package Functional Services for Intelligence Support. The INTEL-FS Spiral I project is intended to provide the common elements of the INTEL-FS as a fully integrated component of the Bi-Strategic Command (BI-SC) Automated Information Systems (AIS) and to serve as a baseline for future enhancement. 

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use the Optional Preliminary Bidding Procedure. In this procedure, the formal Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) will be preceded by a Request for Bidders Views (RFBV) on a draft of the IFB. The RFBV release is planned for November 2007. 

The rough cost estimate for the implementation component of the Spiral I Increment 1 capability is Euro 11.1 million ($15.2 million). The implementation component of Increments 2 and 3 of the Spiral I capability are estimated at Euro 3.6 million ($4.9 million) and Euro 2.2 million ($3.0 million), respectively. 

The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12401-INTEL FS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of Euro 100,000 ($136,500). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the bid closing date by more than 12 months, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and bid guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

Bids received in response to the IFB will be evaluated through a Best Value approach. The contract award is planned for the third quarter of 2008. The top-level bid evaluation criteria with their associated weightings will be as follows: price (50%), engineering (20%), management (15%), supportability (10%), and risk (5%).  

All bids will be evaluated against the criteria described above. When the evaluation is completed, the score for each bidder will be obtained through the weighted average of the stated evaluation factors by using the weights specified above and the following formula to obtain the weighted price score:

Price Score = (50-(50*(Price of Bid/Average Price of All Bids-1)))*0.5

The solicitation will include a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their financial ability to undertake this project and mandatory criteria for extensive experience with the provision of similar types of systems.

Access to the capability is required at 18 static HQs and 18 deployable HQs. Training and reference systems are also required. Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of the capability to include hardware, software, documentation, installation, consultancy services, testing, on-site training, and on-site support. A three-year warranty period will also be included for maintenance and support of the system. Quotations will be on a fixed price basis for the total of the contract.

Bid documents, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and contractual documents, are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Bidders may also be given access to a bidders library that may include material up to the level of NATO SECRET. Performance of the contract will also require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for the contract.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

These services are required to complement the Bi-SC AIS core services with an integrated and supported suite of intelligence services capable of supporting the work of intelligence staffs at all static and deployable Command Facilities of the NATO Command Structure. The INTEL-FS Spiral I capability is also envisioned to expose those intelligence services and products needed by other functional areas, such as the management of intelligence information requests and reporting of enemy order of battle information. 

In accordance with the INTEL-FS capability package, it is expected that there will be three other spiral projects to complete the INTEL-FS capability, each expected to be acquired through separate procurements.

The complete INTEL-FS Spiral I capability package is expected to be delivered in three increments, each increment providing an integral, usable and operationally-fielded capability. The current authorization is intended to address the initial increment, providing a basic INTEL-FS capability, which will then serve as the baseline for further enhancement in subsequent increments. It is envisioned that, given successful delivery of each preceding increment and agreement on scope and price for each subsequent increment, the selected contractor would be retained for each of the subsequent increments. The project will be subject to the Two Stage Authorization Procedure. 

A summary of the requirements of the project, subject to refinement during the requirements specification process, is available to potential bidders. The summary includes the projected capability to be delivered in each increment of the overall INTEL-FS Spiral I project. For a copy of the summary, send an email request to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov
 
BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request Declaration of Eligibility: 2 October 2007

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for quantity one (1) Mitsubishi EA8 Sinker EDM. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Kearney Machinery & Supply Inc. for the following reasons: The MSFC building 4705 machine shop posses a larger version of this die sinker (a Mitsubishi EA12) which was used to develop the specimen notching tooling and control programming required to manufacture fracture mechanics and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) test specimens for the Ares I Upper Stage manufacturing processes demonstration programs. The EA12 system is larger than required for test specimen machining, but it was the only one available on the Center which could do this type of work. Of particular importance is the CNC controlled C axis (which allows the system to produce notch shapes a standard plunge die sinker cannot produce) and the burn cycle control program (which automatically monitors the conductivity of the burn and updates the cutting parameters every few milliseconds to produce a consistent surface finish, part to part). Due to the anticipated Ares I Upper Stage manufacturing processes development and demonstration workload/timeline, the Materials and Processes Laboratory Metals Engineering Branch Processes Development Team  must replace its old plunge die sinker.  1)	The programming and tooling developed on the Mitsubishi EA12 EDM Die Sinker is directly transferable to the smaller EA8 die sinker, which fits within the Processes Development Teams budget and available work space. This programming and tooling would not be directly transferable to another manufacturers die sinker. 2)	Transferring the programming and tooling developed on the EA12 Die Sinker to another manufacturers die sinker would require extensive operator training as well as programming and tooling redevelopment. This time is not available within the Ares I Upper Stage manufacturing processes demonstration programs timeline. 3)	If the programming and tooling developed on the EA12 Die Sinker were successfully transferred to another manufacturers die sinker, future lessons learned from the additional specimen machining would not be directly transferable back to the EA12 Die Sinker. Transferring the lessons learned back to the EA12 Die Sinker would once again require additional programming and tooling changes. This time is not available within the Ares I Upper Stage manufacturing processes demonstration programs timeline. 4)	Choosing another manufacturers Die Sinker would reduce redundancy and increase risk to the Ares I Upper Stage manufacturing processes demonstration programs by effectively eliminating the existing EA12 Die Sinker as a back-up resource for producing specimens during schedule backlogs or for producing specimens if the EM30 die sinker were to break down. There is not sufficient schedule margin to accommodate such as risk. 5)	According to the manufacturer, Mitsubishi signs contractual agreements with its dealers for territorial areas of the United States. For the state of Alabama, Mitsubishi/ MC Machinery Systems (the manufacturer and exclusive American distributors, respectively) appointed Kearney Machinery located in Birmingham, AL. No direct or competing sales efforts exist within this region. Summary: Only a Mitsubishi die sinker directly compatible with the existing EA12 Die Sinker will satisfy the governments minimum requirements for this request and such equipment is only available to MSFC from Kearney Machinery and Supply, Inc.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 09/03/07.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis with Trompeter Electronics, Inc., 5550 East McDowell Road, Mesa, AZ  85215-9698. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Trompeter Electronics, Inc., is the only known source capable of satisfying the Government's minimum requirement    The contract type is anticipated to be a Firm Fixed Price type contract in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Contract Line Item Numbers and descriptions are:  CLIN 0001 -  P/N 155-1157-1  TCTCIII Cable Set (14 each) to include shipping if any.  This project requires patch connections and cable assemblies that need to be compatible with those used in currently fielded systems.  The patch assemblies allow access to signals from essential communications equipment within the currently fielded systems (such as trunk encryption devices and a global positioning system timing receiver) for signal routing and troubleshooting.   Continued procurement of these patch connections and cable assemblies are required to maintain the configuration management (CM), interchangeability, interoperability, and logistical footprint of fielded systems.  Any deviation from the current infrastructure could jeopardize current operations.  Without these cable assemblies and patch panels, the module components could not operate efficiently, thus hindering restoration of network connectivity in the case of a communications failure.  This could create separation between military assets, hindering the military's ability to execute their mission.  The purchase of any other cable assemblies and patch panels would result in a duplication of costs to the government to modify the current design, recreate baseline drawings, testing and validation costs, operator and maintenance training costs, in addition to the logistical costs of managing two different systems.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 13 September 2007, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.

<SUBJECT>17 -- NATO TRAINER CARGO AIRCRAFT (TCA) STUDY
<SOLNBR>R1654
<CONTACT>Henry  Wu henry.wu@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The requirement is to develop a source list of interested companies to conduct and prepare a "study" for Trainer Cargo Aircraft (TCA) Alternatives.  The aim is to identify potential alternatives for the three (3) NATO owned and operated TCA aircraft (B707) stated at the NATO Air Base located at Geilenkirchen, Germany. The TCA aircraft provide valuable airlift (cargo and personnel) support of NAEW&C Force Command  (FC) E-3A aircraft operations.  The TCAs are also used for pilot basic qualification and continuation training.  Due to their age, flying hours and accumulated cycles, it has become increasingly difficult to sustain and maintain these aircraft in a cost effective manner.  Based on the requirements articulated buy FC, airlift support for NE-3A operations may be required until the year 2035 and possibly beyond. NAPMA has developed an initial list of potential alternatives for fulfillment of the TCA requirements.  Potential options include replacement of existing aircraft, leasing of aircraft and procurement of air transport services to support the NAEW&C FC military requirements.  Options also include pilot training, organic and or contracted services. NAPMA requires more information to determine the viability of the options and to facilitate the eventual generation of a formal Request for Information (RFI). Accordingly, NAPMA would like to enlist and solicit industry support in obtaining this information.  The current annual TCA flight requirements are provided as follows: Radius: .  1,000 to 4,000 km, 90 flights .  4,000 to 6,000 km, 80 flights .  10,000 to 15,000 km, 10 flights Cargo & Pax: .  100 kg to 1 pallet + 5 to 20 pax, 60 flights .  3,000 - 7,500 kg, 3 to 5 pallets + 40 to 60 pax, 60 flights .  7,000 - 15,000 kg, 7 to 10 pallets + 60 to 80 pax, 50 flights .  700 x 300 x 175 cm, 5,000 kg, oversized cargo, 10 flights  Passengers:   .  30 to 50 groups pax, 12 flights of 6,000 km Pilot Training: .  Multi-engine, crew coordination, initial qualification .  Pilot proficiency In summary, the intent of this announcement is to solicit the interest of qualified companies within your nation who are in interested in this potential solicitation.  Accordingly, interested companies are requested to response to the Contracting Officer, with a one-page "white paper" with an understanding of this document and provide contact details, i.e., POC and alternate, e-mail addresses, full postal address, post code, telephone and fax numbers for your company and or for each nominated company. Request responses NLT 10 SEPTEMBER 2007  Signed: Gerald W. Hillman, Contracting Officer, NATO AWACS International Division

<b><u>Liberia - Mount Coffee Hydro Power Feasibility Study</u></b>
The Grantee, The Government of Liberia, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to examine the technical and economic viability of the reconstruction and expansion of the Mount Coffee Hydro Power Station in Liberia.  

This Request for Proposals was originally posted on April 2, 2007, but the response date was suspended.  There has been an amendment to the original Grant Agreement, modifying the Terms of Reference (TOR) and the budget.  The TOR has been revised in its entirety and the new budget for the activity is $531,500.   

The Mount Coffee Hydro Power Station in Liberia was destroyed during the recent period of civil unrest.  The project would provide Liberia with a reliable source of cheap energy, and it is a national priority as the Government of Liberia strives to recover.  The FS would examine the potential for a 100-megawatt (MW) facility, expected to cost approximately $100 million.  

This feasibility study for the Mt. Coffee Hydro Power project includes the following terms of reference:

Task 1:  Review Available Data and Develop Work Plan
Task 2:  Conduct Site Review and Develop Preliminary Designs
Task 3:  Identify Specific Technology and Systems Requirements 
Task 4:  Develop Project Cost Estimates and Investment Requirements and Conduct a Benefit/Cost Analysis 
Task 5:  Conduct an Economic and Financial Assessment 
Task 6:  Financing Plan
Task 7:  Assess the Development Impact of the Project
Task 8:  Conduct a Preliminary Environmental and Socioeconomic Impact Assessment Task 9:  Prepare and Submit Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $531,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal and the Terms of Reference, are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <u>4:00PM, Local Time, on Tuesday, September 18, 2007</u> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole-source purchase order with Pure Works Inc., doing business as Pure Safety, of 1321 Murfreesboro Rd, Suite 200, Nashville, TN 37217 to provide a library of web-based training courseware customized for SSA use for safety and occupational health topics such as accident investigation, preventing back injury, cleaning up small chemical spills, materials handling and storage, safety orientation, environmental overview, office safety, OSHA 300 recordkeeping, personal protective equipment, defensive driving: small vehicles, supervisory safety, blood borne pathogens, and office ergonomics, and to provide maintenance and support for five (5) SSA Private Label Library courses previously developed for SSA and copyrighted by Pure Works, Inc. for the following topics: Asbestos Awareness, Fire Extinguisher Safety, Hazard Communication, Preventing Back Injury, and Preventing Slips, Trips and Falls. This training service is intended for and is specifically tailored for use by SSA occupational safety and health representatives located at SSA offices nationwide. This contractor is uniquely qualified because of its copyrighted coursework previously developed, implemented and currently used by SSA.  This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. It is SSA's belief that Pure Works Inc. is the only source qualified to meet our needs, in that other sources could not provide comparable training course specifically tailored to SSA?s needs without substantially increased costs to the Government to replace and supplement courses that Pure Works currently provides to SSA.  SSA will not issue a solicitation.  SSA will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement.  Responses must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that a firm other than Pure Works Inc. can provide the web-based online training courseware as described above.  If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement within 7 days of its publication, it will proceed as stated herein. See Numbered Note #22, substituting (per FAR 5.203(a) and 12.204(b)) a response time of seven days for this acquisition of a commercial item for the forty-five day response time appearing in the note. Respondents should refer to SSA Web-based Training Courseware. The Government will consider all responses but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government. The government will not pay for any information provided.

Justification:  

The National Cancer Institute has a need for advanced tools for high resolution imaging applications in nanobiology, which include fully automated tools for 2-Dimension and 3-Dimension imaging of nanoparticles, molecular complexes, cells and healthy and diseased tissues.  The Laboratory for Cell Biology requires the FEI PHENOM Tabletop Scanning Electron Microscope as it provides a unique and essential component of the necessary technological platforms to achieve NCI goals. 

This is the beginning of a new generation of mini-sized scanning electron microscopes and is expected to increase the ease of automated microscopy of specimens.  Over the last few years, NCI has been exploring ways to miniaturize and automate electron microscopy, and the availability of this tool will take the NCI one step further towards testing and adapting technologies already available in the semiconductor field to biology.  NCI expects that these technologies could become widely used in the NIH community in the coming years.

Benefit

The availability of this system is expected to significantly accelerate advances at NCI on imaging at molecular and atomic resolution.  Applications that are envisaged include: (i) imaging of whole cells, (ii) imaging thin sections of tissue to determine the optimal regions in the section for subsequent viewing in the transmission electron microscope. Combined with elemental analysis this would provide us with a unique capability for rapid progress from tissue to histology.  

Without this instrumentation, the required scientific research and techniques documented above cannot be carried out. To the best of our knowledge, the Phenom is the only instrument that meets these specifications.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on September 10, 2007.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>B -- Nicotine Exposure and Metabolism in Alaska Native Adults

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) plan to procure on a sole source basis with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), 4000 Ambassador Drive D-DCHS, Anchorage, AK  99508 for a  study of nicotine exposure and metabolism in Alaska Native Adults.   The primary objectives of the Nicotine Exposure and Metabolism in Alaska Native Adults study (NEAM study) are to 1) describe exposure to nicotine and carcinogens in Alaska Native adults who smoke cigarettes, use commercial chew tobacco, or use a homemade mixture of chew tobacco and ash (Iqmik); 2) characterize nicotine metabolism in Alaska Native adult tobacco users by measuring plasma 3?-hydroxycotinine:cotinine ratio and by genotyping genes related to nicotine metabolism; and 3)  quantify the pH, free nicotine content, and carcinogen (tobacco-specific nitrosamine or TSNA) content in commercial chew and Iqmik.  The prevalence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use in American Indians/Alaska Natives is the highest of any group in the United States, and Alaska Natives experience disproportionate rates of tobacco-related deaths. Iqmik is a homemade form of smokeless tobacco in which leaf tobacco is mixed with ash derived from punk fungus, which elevates the pH, raising the amount of free nicotine available for absorption. There is currently little known about the differences in health risks between commercially produced smokeless tobacco such as Copenhagen? and Iqmik.  It is believed that differences in nicotine metabolism influence tobacco use patterns, and the rate of an individual?s nicotine metabolism may be an important factor in determining ideal dosing for nicotine replacement therapy. This study will generate information on nicotine and carcinogen exposure in an underserved population with the highest prevalence of tobacco use in the country. Results will be used to generate information for nicotine replacement therapy dosing. This is especially important for Iqmik users as there are currently no treatment guidelines for users of this product. Information on nicotine and carcinogen exposure associated with Iqmik use can be used to generate public health messages for local tobacco control programs, as local tobacco control workers currently have little information on the potential health effects of Iqmik with which to counsel their patients.  ANTHC shall conduct a cross-sectional study of Alaska Native adult tobacco users and nonusers living in Bristol Bay, Alaska (an area with high cigarette and smokeless tobacco use). ANTHC shall enroll approximately 400 participants in the full study: 50 in each group of male and female cigarette users, commercial chew users, Iqmik users, and tobacco nonusers. The contractor shall ask each participant to respond to a questionnaire about their tobacco use and general health status, to undergo phlebotomy for blood collection, and to provide a urine specimen. The contractor shall ask commercial chew users and Iqmik users to provide a sample of their tobacco product for testing. The contractor shall invite up to 75 tobacco users who are not eligible for the full study to participate in a product testing study (25 of each, users of roll your own cigarettes, nasal snuff, or commercial chew mixed with ash).  ANTHC was formed in December 1997 when statewide health programs and services that were a function of the Indian Health Service (IHS), an operating Division of the US Department of Health and Human Services, were transferred from federal ownership and control to a new set of owner-customers, the Natives of Alaska. Under federal law, all Alaska Natives are simultaneously both the owners and the customers of the Consortium, with their interests represented through their tribal governments and regional nonprofit organizations, whose representatives comprise the ANTHC Board of Directors. The transfer of ownership marked a paradigm shift in thinking about Native health services, as visionary tribal leaders set a bold new direction: a statewide unified Native health system that seeks to achieve the ?highest health status in the world? for Alaska Native people.  ANTHC is the largest and most comprehensive Native-owned health services organization in the U.S. and serves 130,682 Alaska Natives statewide, representing 231 federally recognized tribes.  ANTHC is at the center of the Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS), a statewide collaborative network of over 30 different tribally-operated regional hospitals, village-based clinics, and community health programs.  Together, ANTHC works to promote Native self-determination, quality health services, and wellness. This experience and expertise is not readily available within the research community.  The ANTHC is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because it is the only organization to have received Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation tribal approval to conduct the NEAM study. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party has the connections and resources to perform this study.   An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on September 12, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NOTICE:   Only local sources will be considered under this solicitation.  Local sources are sources (e.g., corporations or partnerships) that are physically located in Japan and authorized (i.e., licensed and registered) to perform in Japan, the type  of professional service specified in this solicitation. Specifically, a prospective offeror must be duly authorized to operate and conduct business in Japan and must fully comply with all laws, decrees, labor standards, and regulations of Japan during the  performance of the resulting contracts.   In addition, prior to award of the contracts, offerors must be registered with the Government of Japan to do work in Japan and possess necessary and permits to perform work specified in this solicitation. CONTRACT  INFORMATION:  The professional services required to stop red soil run-off from the eroded slopes and the road surface near the 3200 meter marker by stabilizing the slopes using nailing and by applying soil cement to the road.  Both sides of the road are h eavily eroded with potential for slope failure due to a large amount of rainwater concentrating at the locations where the road reaches its lowest point.  The road has an approximately 150 meter stretch downhill with up to a 28% road gradient with no cross  drains along this entire length.  This topographic condition inevitably causes erosion at the lowest point of the road.  The project also involves installation of cross drains along the 150 meter stretch of the road to avoid the concentration of rainwater  that causes erosion.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. W912HV-07-T-0029 will be available on 30 Aug 2007 and quotes are due 12 Sep 2007 and not later than 1500 hours Japan Standard Time.

I.	BACKGROUND AND NEED 

Since the 1950s, researchers have been concerned about the effect media violence has on youth behavior and development.  A 1972 US Surgeon Generals report voiced this concern to the scientific community.  The 1980s and 1990s were marked with laboratory and field experiments attempting to parse out the role movies, television, and video games played in aggressive attitudes and behaviors.  Findings contributed to the 2002 US Surgeon General report on Youth Violence.   Today, there is general agreement in the scientific community that viewing violence, at least for some children, increases aggressive attitudes, values, and behaviors.  Even with this prolific research activity, gaps in our understanding of the relationship between media violence and aggressive behavior remain.  First, despite substantial evidence of short-term effects of media violence on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, little research has considered the link with seriously violent or criminal behavior.  Second, effects of media violence on aggressive behavior seem to be particularly pronounced for younger children; little research has considered the link for older children and adolescents. Third, with increased use of the Internet among young people, little is known about how exposure to violence on the Internet fit into our growing understanding of the effect of violent mediums.  The Internet is fast becoming the telephone of the 21st century, with an estimated 97% of young people between the ages of 12 and 18 using online communication.  Because almost all youth are now online, this access may have increased opportunities for children and youth to be exposed to violence.  Websites such as hate pages that encourage discrimination of specific types of people, and those reporting real violence such as news websites have the potential to reinforce cognitive styles and orientations that support aggressive responding, thereby increasing the perpetration of seriously violent behavior.

II.  	PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze data related to youth 10-15 exposed to media violence that will support and further the understanding of the co-occurrence of exposure to media violence and engaging in serious criminal and/or aggressive behavior.   In addition to supporting the general management of this project (e.g., data cleaning, preparing data files, generating basic reports), the contractor will support conducting extensive and complex analyses on the longitudinal data (from years 1 and 2).  

III. 	SCOPE OF WORK
The contractor will be responsible for media violence exposure data collection, statistical analyses and dissemination of findings from Media Violence data.  

IV.  	TASKS TO BE PERFORMED
1: Clean and analyze Year 2 media violence data.
2: Management and oversight of Year 3 Media Violence data collection

V. 	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE September 30, 2007 to September 29, 2008

VI. 	DELIVERABLES 

	1: Media violence exposure data file for Year 2 of data collection by 1/31/08.
	2: Summary report of Year 2 media violence exposure data by 4/30/08.
3: Raw data file of Year 3 data by 9/30/08.

<DESC>Background:


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  Among these records are the Decennial Population (and Housing) Censuses, created by the Bureau of the Census, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.



The objective of this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice (RFI) is to determine whether any non-profit or for-profit entities are interested in forming a partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to provide electronic access to the records of the 1940 Decennial Census of Population and Housing in 2012, and under what terms such a partnership might be established.  The nature of this partnership is described below.  The Decennial Population Census has been taken every 10 years since 1790 by the Bureau of the Census.  Under Title 13, United States Code, these records are restricted from public disclosure, except for aggregated statistical data without personal identifiers, until such a time as the individual privacy rights of those identified in the census forms, known as schedules, have expired.  The date when the information can be released to the public has been determined to be 72 years from the date of the Census.



NARA has a statutory obligation not only to make these records available but also to sell complete copies of the 1940 census.  In previous releases of decennial census records, copies of microfilm rolls containing the census records were sold by NARA.  Along with the Census schedules are so-called Soundex rolls that served as an index to some of the schedules.  There are Soundex rolls for the 1880 through 1920 Censuses, and a partial Soundex for the 1930 Census.  There is no Soundex for the 1940 and later Censuses. In recent years, private for-profit companies have purchased the Census microfilm from NARA and digitized the microfilm to make it available to researchers using the Internet, along with other Federal and non-Federal records and databases of genealogical interest.  The public has now come to expect that such records are readily available and searchable by name via the Internet.  In accordance with NARA's Strategic Plan, NARA plans to make available digital copies of the census records.  


Goal 4 of the strategic Plan states: 


We will provide prompt, easy, and secure access to our holdings anywhere, anytime; and  
NARA has identified 2 applicable strategies to achieve this goal. 
A. For the broadest possible access, we will make digital copies of selected non-electronic records available online.  We will identify these holdings in a digitization plan that sets priorities for putting these holdings online. 
B. We will work to establish partnerships with both governmental and private institutions to facilitate the availability of NARA holdings over the Internet, in accordance with appropriate Government laws, regulations, policy, and guidance. 


The strategic plan also contains specific language that addresses digitization.  It says that NARA will work to digitize selected records, including those most requested by researchers, and will put searchable descriptions of all our holdings online with clear information about the archival context of the original records and how they may be located and used. 


The strategic plan is available online at: http://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/.

Description
Request for Information (RFI) for the 1940 Decennial Population Census Digital Reformatting and Access Project


The following information describes the scope of the project:


Original Records: 4,643 rolls of 35mm microfilm
Existing Index: None.  A name index must be created.


Records Security: Access to records is restricted by Title 13, USC.  All handling of records must follow Census Bureau's security requirements and procedures.  These requirements include having every person with access to Census information swear in writing (Special Sworn Status) that they will never release any information on the Census to anyone else until the date of official public release (see below).
Limits on Indexing: If name index is done prior to release date, it must be done within the US.


Release Date: April 2, 2012


Type of Re-formatting: Digitization, 8-bit gray scale, to be by NARA staff.


NARA plans to digitize the records in-house using NARA staff.  This is for both cost and security reasons.  NARA will also prepare the electronic equivalent of roll lists, which more broadly identify the records by State and County or City.  Currently we have made no decisions about creating or purchasing other finding aids such as those we made available for the 1930 Census, such as color reproductions of enumeration district (ED) maps or city directories.


NARA is looking for a partner to create a searchable name index to the microfilm in exchange for the right to fulfill orders for segments of the index and the right to charge a reasonable subscription fee to institutions and individuals for access to the index.  Access to the digitized records will remain free.  The number and type of data fields or elements to be captured by the index must be addressed in the response to the RFI.  The estimated cost of producing the index must be included as part of any response to the RFI.


Access to the records and the complete index will be provided free of charge at NARA'S Archives I facility in Washington, DC, and at all of the NARA regional archives facilities where Census microfilm is available.  These regional facilities are located in Waltham, MA (suburban Boston); Pittsfield, MA; New York City; Philadelphia; Morrow, GA (suburban Atlanta); Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO; Ft. Worth, TX; Denver, CO; Seattle, WA; San Bruno, CA (suburban San Francisco); Laguna Niguel, CA (Orange Co., CA); and Anchorage, AK.  Under the terms of any agreement, NARA will not permit the copying of any part of the index while using NARA'S website or at NARA location during the period of the agreement but will expect that its patrons will be permitted free access and print capability during their visit.  The digital images of the Census will be available for free on the Internet to all users but it is understood that without the index, the images themselves are of very limited research value.


NARA is interested in recouping its costs to digitize the microfilm and therefore will expect that a royalty fee will be paid by the concessionaire based on the gross revenue of sales of partial indexes and copies of the images on DVD or other hard electronic media.


This RFI is the first step that NARA plans to take to solicit input and interest from the vendor community and to promote competition in response to the forthcoming solicitation. 


Response Instructions 


NARA requests that responses are submitted in Microsoft Word format or if necessary, other products from the Microsoft Suite.  Briefly describe your company or institution, your products, past and current projects, and current services, history, ownership, financial information, the number of employees, and other information you deem relevant.  Please provide points of contact, including name, address, phone/fax number, and email.  You are encouraged to provide comments on the 1940 Population Census Re-formatting and Access Project approach.  Respond only if you can provide the total solution to this project.  Discuss technically feasible alternatives and provide non-binding order of magnitude cost and schedule estimates. Indicate whether your solution or product is commercially available or is on the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule.  Supplemental product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may also be submitted.  Furthermore, please include substantive responses to the following:


1) Understanding that indexing cannot be conducted outside the United States and that anyone with access to any part of the Census before its public release date must have Special Sworn Status: a) what work processes will you employ to create a name index and (b) how would you ensure that the Census Bureau's security requirements are met while the records are in your custody?


2) Do you believe there will be a market for copies of or access to partial indexes by State or other geographic subdivision, and why?  What is your strategy for tapping into that market?


3) If granted a "concession" to be the exclusive distributor of copies of the 1940 Census to the public, how many years do you anticipate having a need for the concession?  Explain why you need the concession for that period of time.


4) In order to re-coup its expenses, NARA anticipates charging a royalty as part of the "concession" agreement.  Do you provide royalties to other archives or libraries and how are they determined?


5) Discuss the potential data storage requirements for this project and your capacity to both store and provide public access via the Internet.


6) Provide feedback on our requirements.  Specifically provide comments on any requirements that you believe cannot be implemented.  Describe how you would organize the requirements so that both NARA and your company or organization can make the 1940 Census publicly available at a reasonable cost and still receive sufficient compensation to offset the cost of providing the records digitally.


7) Identify possible constraints or potential risks.


8) What tools and metrics do you use to measure system performance?


9) Describe your IT security program.


10) Describe the type of contractual agreement and pricing structure that you envision.


11) Describe your disaster recovery program.


12) Would your firm or organization be interested in giving an informational presentation to the NARA?

The National Institute for Literacy (Institute) was established to ensure that literacy would have a place on the federal policy agenda and to invigorate a national effort to improve adult literacy.  Its primary activities to strengthen literacy across the lifespan are authorized by the U.S. Congress under two laws, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) in the Workforce Investment Act and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).  The AEFLA directs the Institute to provide national leadership regarding literacy, coordinate literacy services and policy, and serve as a national resource for adult education and literacy programs. The NCLB law directs the Institute to disseminate information on scientifically based reading research pertaining to children, youth, and adults as well as information about development and implementation of classroom reading programs based on the research.  A significant component of the Institute?s NCLB-authorized dissemination effort has focused on parents with well-developed literacy skills who are accustomed to consulting printed materials for information.   While the Institute will continue to disseminate information based on the findings from scientific research to these parents, the Institute is beginning to turn its attention to a different group of parents. 

The Institute is seeking technical assistance in starting a pilot project that focuses on parents of K-3 children who would benefit from learning more about how to support their children's acquisition of reading skills but who are not likely to use stand-alone print materials.  These are likely to be hard to reach parents with low literacy skills with low educational attainment. The purpose of this project will be to disseminate information that engages parent-participants in activities that develop their knowledge of how children learn to read and their ability to help their children become successful readers.

<DESC>Amendment 03 posted 29 August 2007<br><br>Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with a continuing requirement to maintain the currency, efficiency and effectiveness of all curricular materials.  This tasking requires the continual update, modification, amendment, enhancement and standardization of approximately 30% or less of all aviation training curricula, courseware and instructional support materials.  In addition, this N7 tasking includes management, organizational support, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs, to include extensive on-site support at the locations identified below. Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC). NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their Wings of Gold from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One, NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two, NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four, NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing five, NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six, NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0. The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all source data, training products, courseware, publicatons, software, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves roughly 29 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.  Contractor activities will include the design, development, changes, revision ( 30 to 50% or less ) and maintenance, conversion, testing, documentation, training, deployment, establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base. The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.  A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).  Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server technology hardware, software and network to support current and future requirements. The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR SubPart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a five year ordering period with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  The Government further anticipates a $40M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as task/delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  A secret clearance is required to work on this project.

<DESC>AMENDED ADDING TO THE DESCRIPTION ANOTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure a custom-designed and custom-built Microwave Waveguide from Thomas Keating, Station Mills, Daux Road, Billingshurts, West Sussex, RH14 9SH, England.  The Institute intends to procure this system by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

The requirements necessary are (1) The system must include corrugated waveguide, taper and horn to provide low-loss transmission (<3db) in the frequency range of at least 262 to 266 GHz; (2) The corrugated waveguide, taper and horn must handle at least 100 mW of microwave power; (3) The corrugated horn should provide an optical transition from the rectangular waveguide mode TE10 of the 264 GHz to the HE11 Gaussian beam mode with the beam size appropriate for the corrugated waveguide; (4) The corrugated horn should physically interface with the output flange (WR-4.3, UG-387/U-M) of the 264 GHz source from Virginia Diodes, Inc.  and provide for positioning on an optical board for a focused Gaussian beam input to a quasi-optical polarizer and transmit any polarization (linear or circular) to the corrugated taper; (6) The corrugated taper should connect to the corrugated waveguide, provide optical focusing of the HE11 Gaussian beam to 2.5 mm diameter and allow for redirection of the beam by 54.7 degrees for ?magic-angle spinning? NMR experiments and (7) The corrugated waveguide and taper must fit in a diameter of 17mm to be compatible with available space within a home-built NMR probe.
(8)quasi-optical subsystem for 264 GHZ microwaves to be used in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).

These corrugated microwave structures (waveguide, taper and horn) for operation at 264 GHz microwave frequency must be custom-designed and custom-built for the following reasons; (a) The 264 GHz operation frequency is not a standard microwave band; (b)the microwave source and quasi-optical polarizer that will be used in conjunction with these items do not have standard dimensions and operating characteristics;(c) the dimensions and geometry of our existing 9.4 Tesla magnet and home-built NMR probe are not standard and (d) dynamic nuclear polarization is not a standard technique, so standard commercial equipment for dynamic nuclear polarization does not exist.  

Contractor shall meet the following requirements for the 264 GHz quasi-optical system : a) the quasi-optical system shall be able to adjust the polarization in either perpendicular direction to circular polarization with either handedness.  The system shall vary the polarization using a low-loss, interferometric method, rather than by selective attenuation. b) shall be capable of redirecting the circularly polarized microwave beam to enable power monitoring. c)shall operate over the frequency range from 262 to 266 GHz, at a minimum d)shall provide low-loss transmission of at least 100mW of microwave power, with power loss below 3db. e) shall provide microwave optics to launch a Gaussian microwave beam into a corrugated microwave waveguide in a solid-state NMR probe positioned vertically in a superconducting magnet.  The system shall be compatible wiht reproducible mounting below the base of the superconducting magnet, with the microwave beam being directed upwards into the solid-state NMR probe. To the best of the Governments knowledge, Thomas Keating Ltd, is the only known supplier capable of custom design and custom production of corrugated waveguide components and 264 GHz quasi-optical subsystem with the dimensions and specifications required by our laboratory.

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NIDDK to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.  Offers must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties and/or other information that demonstrates that the offer meets all of the foregoing requirements.  Two (2) copies of the capability statements and related materials must be received in this office by 5:00p.m. EST on or before August 31, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Request for copies of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) shall be emailed to Tina Robinson robinsti@mail.nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-4226.  It is anticipated that RFQ#  NIH-NIDDK-07-378 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  NOTE: In order to receive an award from the NIDDK, contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov  in order to register.  In addition, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov

Color of the cross shall be Color 11105 (gloss red) as shown in FED-STD-595 and the white background shall be Color 17886 (gloss white) of the same specification. (4) Items contained in the kit shall be individually sealed for protection and shall be re-sealable. (5) Individual items shall be packaged in two separate, re-sealable plastic bags, one for general first aid items and one for trauma items as listed below.

<DESC>The National Supplier Clearinghouse - Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC) is the single organizational entity responsible for issuing or revoking Medicare supplier billing privileges for suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) and maintaining supplier files that contain information collected via the Medicare enrollment application (CMS 855S).  

The NSC-MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS supplier enrollment from that of other Medicare providers and suppliers.  In particular this includes special licensing, insurance, inventory, etc.  The unique standards that DMEPOS suppliers must meet are contained in 42 C.F.R. 424.57.  The primary function of the NSC is to, at a minimum, 1) ensure that only qualified suppliers of Durable Medical equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) are enrolled or remain enrolled in the Medicare program; 2) take necessary actions to revoke enrolled suppliers who no longer meet supplier standards; 3) establish and maintain a fraud prevention and detection program; 4) process DMEPOS supplier enrollment applications and appeals in a timely manner; 5) participate in the development, testing, and transition/implementation/operation of the Provider Enrollment Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) for DMEPOS suppliers; and 6) ensure that all DMEPOS suppliers are properly accredited.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the National Supplier Clearinghouse Medicare Administrative Contractor (NSC-MAC). It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee plus award fee contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in late May/early June of 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is December 2007.

Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can be: *  an existing published wage determination *  a survey underlying a wage determination *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on    a wage determination matter *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.) and 3.) should be followed. With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to: 	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations 	Wage and Hour Division 	U.S. Department of Labor 	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. 	Washington, DC 20210 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an interested party (those affected by the action) can request review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to: 	Wage and Hour Administrator 	U.S. Department of Labor 	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. 	Washington, DC 20210 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the interested party's position and by any information (wage payment data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue. 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to: 	Administrative Review Board 	U.S. Department of Labor 	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. 	Washington, DC 20210 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final. ================================================================           END OF GENERAL DECISION

<DESC>The following information is provided in response to questions/comments posed: Question: What are the specific pay grades for each of the labor categories?   	Answer: Pay grades are not related to any of the skill sets.  Pay is  related to the level of knowledge and qualifications required to meet the  requirements of the task. Question: It states that most anticipated tasks will be for 100-250 hours.   Does this mean that a contractor will be brought in for 2-6 weeks and be gone,  or will there be a continual back log of task orders so they may continue  working on a longer term basis?   	Answer: Both statements above are true and depend on the task.  The  majority of the tasks will be short. Question: Is this IDIQ contract a two or five year contract? 	Answer: This IDIQ contract is for one (1) base year with one (1) option  year. Question:  Do you need pricing for two years or five years. 	Answer:  Please provide pricing for the base year and the option year. Question: The evaluation and approach section 2.2 states two years and  paragraph 3.2 section b.1 states five years.  Which is correct? 	Answer: Paragraph 3.2 section b.1 should read: Estimated labor hours  will be multiplied by the offerorâs fully burdened rate per year for each  specific labor category.  The extended prices for each labor category will then  be added together for the two (2) year period to get a final evaluated price.

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain industry comments and suggestions about a proposed incentive fee and cost share structure for Task Order 0001 of the RSA requirement. A document titled, Proposed Incentive Fee and Cost Share Structure  has been added to the below website. Please review this document and provide comments to Lane Gary at lane.gary@us.army.mil no later than 10 September 2007 at 1:00PM Eastern Time. Responses are strictly voluntary and will not affect the ability to submit  an offer, when a solicitation is released.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Please do not send any proposals.  Requests for proposals, when issued, will be available on the Internet at FedBizOpps.gov. Of particular interest to the Government are industry comments concerning the use of a cost share structure if the total cost exceeds the point at which the contractor will earn only the minimum fee. This structure differs from some other cost-reimbursable  contracts/task orders where the Government is 100 percent responsible for cost overruns once the contractors minimum fee is reached. Please feel free to also comment on the share ratios, the minimum/maximum/target fees, etc.  RSA Environmental Remediation and Program Management Services Website: http://pbc.apgea.army.mil/RsaPrePMC.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Advanced Information Technology Branch (AIT) is requesting information on algorithms, models and simulations that will aide in the transformation from traditional to irregular warfare, to include those that encompass the "soft power" aspects of warfare such as strategic communications, information operations, and enabling partner-allies. To support this transition there is a need to develop the requisite understanding, the analysis methods and approaches, and a suite of supporting models and tools that will assist in short and long term decision making.  The algorithms, models and simulations necessary will encompass a wide range of needs for decision making within the Global battlespace.  Models and simulations that address such diverse areas as societal and individual implications of actions in the diplomatic, information, and economic spheres of action, the effectiveness of military "soft power" actions such as humanitarian assistance and training, and incorporation of real time data and information to provide a comprehensive view of the existing and potentially predicted situational environment in the area of interest are all appropriate topics.  The AIT is interested in algorithms, models and simulations that have well defined inputs and outputs as well as interfaces that can be linked to other models and simulations to create comprehensive view of the battlespace. The response to this RFI is not limited to individual models and simulations.  The algorithm, model and or simulation model may contain constructive analytical simulation as well as human-in-the-loop tools that are useful in a stand-alone mode or, in addition, might support or adjudicate wargames or other analytical simulations. Any simulation that satisfies the required needs regardless of whether it includes partial or all the elements of interest cited above should provide a submission to this RFI.  The algorithms, models and simulations should be well documented and adaptable to the validation and verification process.  In the case of software, please differentiate between models and simulations that are now available as commercially supported products; and software that is currently either under development, or projected for future efforts. Also clearly indicate whether the models/simulations are government owned, open source, or proprietary. Finally, the responders may optionally indicate the scope of any outside user base for their software. For example, does a user group exist, how many agencies currently using your software, and/or what is the approximate number of user systems that are currently supported? All corporate and proprietary information should be so marked and will be fully protected to the extent allowed. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any follow-on acquisitions. White papers should be submitted within 30 days of the publication date of this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. This RFI does not constitute the solicitation of proposals. Responders to this RFI may be requested to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittals. Questions and submissions may be submitted by email to rfi01@ait.nrl.navy.mil.

<DESC>Description:	The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Denton Investigations, is assessing the market to gain information about the procurement of a motion to motion surveillance system. This notice is not a solicitation, but an inquiry regarding the capabilities of  surveillance systems providers and a request for information from offerors who are willing and capable of providing a presentation regarding surveillance system capabilities. We are seeking information from, and will invite, potential vendors to respond to this Request for Information.

Department of Homeland Security Background
The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for assessing the nation's vulnerabilities. It takes the lead in evaluating vulnerabilities and coordinating with other federal, state, local, and private entities to ensure the most effective response. The collection, protection, evaluation and dissemination of information to the American public, state and local governments and the private sector is central to this task.  
The Department of Homeland Security merges under one roof the capability to anticipate, preempt and deter threats to the homeland whenever possible, and the ability to respond quickly when such threats do materialize. 
Homeland Security harnesses our nation's scientific and technological resources to provide Federal, state, and local officials with the technology and capabilities to protect the homeland.
One area of focus for the Department is catastrophic terrorism--threats to the security of our homeland that could result in large-scale loss of life and major economic impact.
Research is designed to counter threats to the homeland, both by evolutionary improvements to current capabilities and development of revolutionary, new capabilities.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation intends to solicit and award NSF Contract OPP-0003289, Modification No. Sixteen (016) on a sole-source basis to the University of Wisconsin -- Madison for the continued development and deployment of the Deep Ice Sheet Coring (DISC) drill to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) drilling site during the 2007-2008 Antarctic field season, operating the drill to collect the initial core as part of a flagship activity in support of the International Polar Year. The contractor will also provide drill development, testing and field support for other funded NSF research projects in the Arctic and Antarctic, to include small field science activities associated with the International Polar Year.  An increased performance period of 12 months is anticipated, from September 30, 2007 through September 30, 2008, at an estimated value of $3,250,000. Based upon information available at this time, NSF considers the University of Wisconsin, Madison to be the only responsible source per the statutory authority at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Vendors that believe their firm can satisfy this requirement shall respond within fifteen days from the date this notice is published with a statement of their capabilities to include literature, brochures, and a detail narrative of their ability to perform this requirement without disruption or increased cost (to include additional costs made necessary as a result of any project transition between organizations). NSF will evaluate all responses to determine if the vendor is qualified and able to perform the required services for the stated period without adversely affecting the drill design, test and development efforts. Refer to numbered notes 22 and 25. NSF has appointed an ombudsman to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors in the conduct of its acquisition activities. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Furthermore, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations in writing to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the ombudsman. Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting officer or as specified elsewhere in this document. Contact information for the National Science Foundation Ombudsman is available at the following URL: http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dcca/ombud.htm.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a brand name contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires renewal of Disknet Pro Client Licenses, including encryption policy manager, annual support and maintenance for their network enterprise.  Interested parties may e-mail nathan.bowles@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, SrA Nathan Bowles, not later than Monday 5 September 2007; 10:00 a.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 1 applies.
V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
Reflex Disknet Pro software is currently installed on the USSOCOM enterprise, and provides USSOCOM Headquarters enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy. Reflex Disknet Pro reveals how security policy is actually applied on the operational network. By highlighting systems and users that do not comply, command attention and resources may then be focused on strengthening the network security posture through better policy enforcement. Reflex Disknet Pro also provides information that will identify issues that are inadequately addressed by existing policy. This information enables USSOCOM to continually develop and refine its computer network security policy. Finally, due to its ability to monitor removable media at a highly granular level, Reflex Disknet Pro is a useful tool to mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements. United States Special Operations Command requires this brand name only support as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $1,018,217.00.  These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees.  The cost that would not be recovered through open competition involves resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology.

The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for one  Epoke SW Sirius 3500 spreader with wheel driven hydraulics to Eagle Integrated Solutions, Inc., 10 Trent Drive PO Box 670, Campbellford, Ontario, Canada, K0L 1L0.  The procurement of one Epoke SW Sirius 3500 spreader with wheel driven hydraulics is necessary for 55 CES to satisfy mission requirements.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).

"Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2003)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 4MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov.

Brand name justification:  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(c), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; Application for brand name descriptions.  Sentinel software, manufactured by OPNET, is the only source (brand name) that can supply the services needed to satisfy the agencies requirements of providing enhancements to the OIG network management capabilities, continued operations and support of OIG Headquarters and 9 regional OIG offices across the country.  The OPNET Sentinel application software will provide a combination of network management application tools that performs systematic configuration audits, analysis of an up-to-date model of the production network to diagnose device configurations errors, policy violations, inefficiencies, and security gaps.  This will aid in ensuring the continuous operation of this OIG network which is critical to the OIG mission.  OIG?s requirement is to maintain network operational readiness at all times. The capability to test new network appliances and applications in a manner that assures when the new appliance or application is deployed into the OIG network will not have a negative impact. This purchase/support agreement provides: (1) Technical support via telephone, e-mail and on-site as required. (2) Software upgrades to the latest version at no additional cost to the OIG. These upgrades continually add features that enhance or add to the performance of the application software. With the recent addition of video conferencing to the OIG network, the planned migration to IPv6, and the award of Networx, it is imperative that the IT Department in OIG has the ability to perform virtual network testing that eliminates any disruption of network services to OIG users.  The OPNET Sentinel product is the only product on the market that has a combination of network management application tools that can forecast network performance before new devices and/or applications are introduced into the OIG network.  It is also the only product that includes hundreds of standard network integrity and security audits that incorporate industry best practices published by the US government agencies, Cisco Systems, and others.  OIG needs this capability due to network growth and complexity (video conferencing, router to router encryption, QOS/TOS, RSA, VPN), coupled with the need to optimize performance of existing and future applications.  This is the only product on the market that meets the OIG requirement.  OIG has recently purchased products from OPNET and has established a favorable relationship.  The services provided during the recent purchase have been of the highest caliber. Technical support has been excellent with a much quicker response time than anticipated. The support has been extremely professional in nature.  Market research was conducted by OIG staff for products similar to OPNET?s IT Sentinel product in May 2007.  A follow up was just conducted. OIG has concluded that OPNET?s IT Sentinel is the most powerful and flexible network-planning-and-design software on the market today.  There is no other product on the market that is as robust.  OPNET is the only distributor of OPNET branded products.  IT Sentinel support and maintenance would be provided directly from OPNET.  Offers are due on Wednesday, September 5, 2007 @ 2:00 pm. EST electronically to the Contract Specialist.   Please contact Marc Long, Contract Specialist, 301-443-7086, regarding this solicitation.

A.  Background

USAID/Ethiopia, under the President?s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), seeks the Pediatric Care and Treatment Program Specialist to serve as Senior Program Specialist for HIV/AIDS.  The successful candidate will act as the programmatic lead in HIV/AIDS pediatrics technical area: In addition s/he will be responsible for various other administrative, fiscal and management functions related to their area of focus. The applicant will be responsible for coordinating technical and policy related issues with Federal and Regional Government Ministries, the USG interagency PEPFAR team, other donors, and non-governmental organizations working in the area of HIV/AIDS. Aspects of these positions are cross-cutting and the incumbent?s duties may be modified or expanded based on the overall needs of USAID?s HIV/AIDS portfolio. 

 
The PEPFAR Initiative is the largest commitment given by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease.  It is a five-year, $15 billion, multifaceted approach to combating the disease in more than 100 countries around the world.  The strategy places an intensified approach on 15 focus countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that represent approximately half the world?s infections.   The goal of PEPFAR is to treat 2 million HIV-infected individuals, prevent 7 million new infections and to provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and orphans.  In Ethiopia, PEPFAR is implemented by five U.S. government agencies:  the U.S. Department of State (DOS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention), the Department of Defense (DOD), and Peace Corps. 


Ethiopia is the second most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 2005 population estimated at 78 million people from 83 ethnic groups and languages, in an area almost twice the size of Texas.  There are nine ethnically based regions and two special administrative areas, one of which is the capital, Addis Ababa.  Approximately 4% of the population lives in Addis Ababa and another 11% in scores of much smaller urban areas throughout the country.  Approximately 85% of the population lives in rural areas.   Religion plays a major role in the lives of most Ethiopians:  approximately 40%-45% of the population adheres to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; approximately 45% of the population is Muslim; and Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestantism constitute more than 10% of the population.  To date there is remarkable religious tolerance and harmony.  

 
The national adult HIV sero-prevalence for 2005 is estimated at 1.4%, with a 5.5 % urban rate and a 0.7% rural rate based on the recently conducted Demographic Health Survey.  HIV in Ethiopia continues to be primarily urban, with wide variation in rural areas.  The rural epidemic is heterogeneous with hotspots. To reach Emergency Plan targets in such a large country with such low prevalence, increased efforts must be made to identify those at high risk, including children, and ensure that they are counseled and tested so that quality HIV support services can be given at early stages.  In addition, PEPFAR/Ethiopia is a food focus country and the nutrition and food security emphasis of its portfolio is expanding. As such, efforts are underway to increase the linkages between nutrition and HIV/AIDS treatment and care support services, a necessary intervention to maintain the nutritional status of HIV positive adults and children in order to enable them to adhere to treatment and live productive lives.



B. Duties and Responsibilities
 

The Pediatric Care and Treatment Program Specialist will provide leadership and technical oversight to PEPFAR Ethiopia in the implementation of pediatric HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment programs.

PART I, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR TEXTUAL RECORDS DIGITATION ENVIRONMENT 1.0  INTRODUCTION The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain all equipment and labor necessary to procure operational new workstations that will provide an expanded capability for the digitization/scanning of textual records at Archives II in College Park Maryland.  The workstations include the accompanying server/software and data deliverables and maintenance of the workstations for a base year with two possible option years described in this statement of work, along with industry standard warranties for the equipment and system.  Existing work stations as described below will also be required to integrate with the new workstations. Statement of Need, Background and Objectives: The Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration needs to expand capabilities for the digitization/scanning of textual records. Currently, the Microfilm Camera Lab of the Special Media Preservation Laboratory operates sixteen (16) traditional planetary-style 35mm microfilm cameras. We anticipate replacing these microfilm cameras over a period of several years with new digital camera systems with indexing software to be used for digitizing a variety of original records. The NWTS labs operate two microfilm scanners (an older roll-film scanner and a newer microfiche scanner) and needs to expand microfilm scanning capabilities. Also, the labs use several high-speed document scanners. All these systems need to be integrated into an environment for digitizing and indexing textual records using a software application for workflow management and document indexing. The existing Special Media Preservation (NWTS) Environment. The NWTS Labs are creating a local area network (LAN) which is comprised of lab equipment (scanners, digital cameras, printers, audio and video capture and playback devices) and the computers used to host the applications that run these devices, as well as the digital storage systems to hold the digital output and servers that manage this entire array of devices. Each lab (audio and video, still photo/digital imaging/aerial/cartographic, motion picture, microfilm camera, and microfilm duplication) has workstations used to capture and prepare digital output from the reformatting devices. The digital resources are saved to a local network attached storage (NAS) server (typically 6 TB to 7 TB of RAID-5 storage with tape back-up and an uninterruptible power supply) that is dedicated to each lab for short-term storage. Digital resources saved to the NAS servers are backed up daily to LTO tapes by project, and copies of the tapes are transferred to protected storage for the duration of the project. Quality control checks are made by technicians during the course of a project and at its completion.  Once approved, the project resources (digital files and related metadata) will be transferred to a centralized storage area network (SAN) managed by NARAs IT department. Daily LTO backups are made of data stored on the SAN. Due to the necessity of choosing workstations and operating systems based upon lab equipment and application needs, servers running Active Directory (Microsoft) and Open Directory (Apple Computing) are used simultaneously to manage the lab network environment. Managed Gigabit switches are used at the workgroup level to provide adequate network throughput between the workstations and local network attachable storage, as well as part of LAN security. Fiber based switches are used to connect the workgroup switches and network attachable storage, as well as providing a link to the centralized SAN. All the equipment and software procured for the textual records digitization environment will be integrated into the NWTS lab environment. Other existing equipment to be used in this environment with the workflow management and document indexing software include-Zeutschel OS 10000TT book scanner-Fujitsu fi-4750c document scanner-Kodak i620 and i1320 document scanners-Sunrise Proscan 2000 microfilm scanner -Wicks & Wilson FS300 microfiche scanner-Various photograph digitizing workstations - Workstations for existing equipment are various Windows based computers.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N860010-7-05927rs is issued as a request for quotation. No set-aside is identified for this RFP. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for technical support services described below.  The Performance Based Statement of Work is as follows:

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) studies building materials; computer-integrated construction practices; fire science and fire safety engineering; and structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Products of the laboratory's research include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and technical data that support innovations by industry and are incorporated into building and fire standards and codes. One of BFRL?s major program areas is Healthy and Sustainable Buildings, to which the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software project is a major contributor.  BEES uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the environmental performance of products based on life-cycle inventory (LCI) data compiled by LCA practitioners for more than 500 environmental flows including raw materials and energy use, air emissions, water effluent, and solid waste.

NIST takes a lead role, with its BEES software, database, and methods, in providing guidance to the building community on the life cycle environmental and economic performance of products.  Reliable, consistent LCI data are key to BEES? success.

With this contract, NIST seeks to take a first step beyond evaluation of building products and simple building product systems toward evaluation of entire facilities. The scope of this contract is limited to commercial and residential buildings. 

The primary objective of this contract is for a Contractor to develop a mapping framework to directly connect an existing, or readily-adaptable, Input/Output (I/O)-based LCI framework with the fixed, BEES-based LCI framework.

The expected outcome is the ability to estimate, in a consistent, transparent manner, the environmental performance of commercial and residential buildings.

Period of Performance - The period of performance is from date of award through 29 FEB 2008.

SPECIFIC TASKS
The Contractor shall develop a mapping framework for converting I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. Specific tasks include:

1.	Select a robust, transparent U.S. IO-LCA database.  Publicly or commercially available documentation shall exist for the selected database that provides detailed, transparent information on its compilation.

2.	Map the LCI flows produced as output of the selected IO-LCA database to the BEES LCI flows. Attached is an Excel file (PWS Attachment #1) giving the fixed BEES LCI flow list, the environmental media to which they refer, and the units in which they are expressed. 

3.	Document matched flows. For IO-LCA database flows with direct, or convertible, mappings to BEES flows, document the match. See the ?Matched Flows? tab of  PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all matched flows. As shown in the attachment, for each matched flow, list the corresponding flow from the selected IO-LCA database. Provide the units in which the IO-LCA database reports these corresponding flows, as well as their CAS Registry numbers if they exist.

4.	Document unmatched flows. For IO-LCA database flows without direct or convertible mappings to BEES flows, document the matching failure. See the ?Unmatched Flows? tab of PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all unmatched flows. As shown in the attachment, documentation includes type of mismatch between BEES flows and IO-LCA flows and suggested work-around, work-around, other suggestion as to how to handle the unmatch, or justification for ignoring the BEES flow (e.g., insignificant--x %- contribution to all 12 BEES environmental impacts)

NOTE: For PBSW attachments # 1 & #2 may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to thee acquisition specialist identified below.

DELIVERABLES AND REPORTS

Report outputs?describe what is to be included in the reports: 

1.)  The deliverable for Task 1 is a 1-page written summary, provided as an electronic MS Word document, justifying the IO-LCA database selection. Any external, written reviews of the detailed data shall be provided. 

2.)  The deliverable for Tasks 2 through 4 is PWS Attachment # 2, with cells highlighted in yellow on the ?Matched Flows? and ?Unmatched Flows? tabs completed. PWS Attachment # 2 shall be provided as an electronic MS Excel file.

3.)  The deliverable for this contract is a spreadsheet indicating how to convert I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. This deliverables will be reviewed and incorporated by the NIST COTR in the research activities of the BFRL Metrics and Tools for Sustainable Buildings Program.

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN THE FEDERAL ACQUISTION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF  FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

This requirement is being procured using full and open competition.  All responsible quoters may submit a quotation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine System to be used in the Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

The NCNR designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of cold and thermal neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research.  The instruments which employ cold neutrons for research have the neutrons directed to them via mirrored guides.  The alignment of these guides to one another is critical to achieve the optimum transmission of neutrons.  

The alignment of the guides is impacted by several factors, which include installation accuracy and support stability.  The NCNR is under a new expansion directive that will include the construction of a new Guide Hall.  This Guide Hall will house at least four (4) instrument guides.  The Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) will be used to align these guides during installation and monitor any shift in position due to floor settling in the future.  The accuracy of the Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine will be key to providing the best possible transmission of neutrons through the guides.

All responsible quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation.  FAR Subpart 13.5 procedures are being utilized.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an Economic Impact Assessment of the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory's (MSEL's) Combinatorial Methods Program.  The Performance Work Statement is as follows:

Performance Work Statement (PWS)

A. Develop Background Material: (1) provide overviews of the NIST-developed infratechnologies and any subsequent standards, in particular characterize the technical nature of each identified infratechnology and its economic role (stage of economic activity affected, type of economic impact, etc.); (2) assess the research strategy (especially the nature of the NIST Program and the use of consortium approach) in terms of how public and private assets were combined to achieve research objectives and how research results were disseminated; and (3) describe and characterize the structure and competitive behavior of the relevant industry segments directly benefiting from the Project, especially the industry structures in which corporate decision making is directly affected by the infratechnologies in question.   

Deliverable:  A technical memorandum containing an assessment of the nature and economic roles of the subject infratechnologies and associated standards for COTR approval

B. 	Analytical Framework: 

(1) Based on the results of Task A, finalize assessment of the appropriate scope of the study, particularly in terms of the nature of infratechnologies and associated standards to be studied and industry coverage (levels in the relevant supply chain(s) where significant and measurable benefits are likely to have occurred); 

(2) Develop conceptual framework that includes (a) the hypothesized impacts by industry segment, stage of economic activity, etc., (b) an assessment of the economic roles of the research and technology transfer mechanisms used in the Program (specifically, the consortium); 

(3) Develop an empirical taxonomy of impact categories to enable survey design;  

Examples of impact categories:

  a) Value of increased R&D efficiency (reduced costs and time);
	
  b) Value of increased production efficiency (higher yields and reduced cost); and,

  c)  Value of market efficiencies (reduced transaction costs).

(4) Incorporate the analysis from Task A of the types and apparent extent of infrastructure-type market failures that have affected the relevant markets by conducting literature reviews, informal industry interviews, and consultations with NIST/MEL and industry experts.

Deliverable:  A framework for data collection and subsequent analysis based hypothesized market failures (i.e., barriers/costs) and hence potential categories of net economic benefits; the analytical framework must include impact measures to be estimated and the impacted industries to be studied based on hypothesized significance of impacts and feasibility of collecting impact data directly from industry; submit for COTR approval.

C. Develop Data Collection Plan: Based upon Tasks A and B above, (1) recommend to the COTR the final selection of industries to be surveyed;  (2) develop survey instruments to obtain data for net benefits estimation;  (3) pretest; (4) submit information to NIST required to obtain OMB clearances for the conduct of the survey.

Deliverable:  Pre-tested and subsequently revised survey instrument for COTR approval.

D.  Conduct Surveys.  Ensure all target populations have high coverage (70?V80 percent target).

E.  Determine Program Costs: (1) Obtain from an estimate of the NIST/MSEL costs of the Government program and any industry contribution that achieved the above hypothesized impacts; and (2) combine with estimates of transfer/assimilation (??pull??) costs incurred by industry.  

Deliverable:  Time series of NIST costs and industry pull costs.

F. Prepare Final Report: Write a final report (draft to be approved by COTR in writing) that (1) briefly describes the tiers in the supply chain(s) studied;  (2) describes the relevant technologies and the infratechnologies for these supply chains in terms of their roles, economic importance, market failure characteristics, and relationships to standardization; (3) presents both quantitative and qualitative findings from the surveys; (4) uses the quantitative estimates of net benefits to the segments of industry studied from to calculate appropriate net present value, benefit-cost ratios and rate-of-return measures for the investment in the research program(s) studied, (5) combines quantitative economic impact estimates with qualitative indicators of NIST impacts on corporate strategies associated with the development, transfer, assimilation and use of measurement and related infratechnology and standards by industry, and (6) has been processed by a technical editor.

Estimated Resources: approximately 1,000 hours of senior researcher time.

Schedule: Offerors should propose a schedule as part of the quote.  Adherence to this schedule is an essential part of overall contractor performance.

Period of Performance: The performance period will be one year from the effective date of the contract.

Place of Performance: The work will take place at the Contractor's facility as proposed.

Quality Assurance Plan

I)	Objective: The purpose of this plan is to provide a quality assurance plan for the work performed for NIST under this effort.  This plan provides a basis for the NIST Contracting Officer??s Technical Representative (COTR) to evaluate the quality of the Contractor??s performance.  The oversight provided for in the contract and in this plan will help to ensure that an acceptable product is delivered to NIST.  Further, this plan provides the COTR with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance.
II)	Performance Standards:
a)	Quality Level: By monitoring the Contractor, the COTR will determine whether the performance levels set forth in the contract have been attained.  Quality standards (i.e., performance standards) for all tasks are specified in this document.
b)	Frequency: During performance of this study, the COTR will periodically assess progress by reviewing and then accepting/rejecting deliverables for each task. The COTR will also conduct period interim assessments of progress and problems encountered. Feedback will be provided to the Contractor to assist in necessary adjustments.
c)	Management Responsiveness: The COTR will determine whether the Contractor has managed each task effectively and efficiently, with successful and timely response to each specific deliverable and the required due date for each deliverable.  The COTR will confirm whether the Contractor has satisfactorily met all reporting requirements.
III)	Evaluation Methods:  The COTR will conduct performance evaluations based upon Section II above and the required performance levels set forth in the contract.  The following techniques will be used to perform surveillance:
a)	Project Status: The COTR will review the proposed project plan and associated updates to determine if the project is on schedule based upon the project plan.  Any deviations in the schedule will be discussed with the Contractor and documented via e-mail or in another written format.
b)	Acceptance Testing of System Enhancements:  The COTR and/or their designee(s) will thoroughly assess each draft deliverable and provide feedback for adjustments/revisions, if necessary, prior to acceptance.

<DESC>"	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This acquisition is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The  combined synopsis/solicitation number is W91ZLK-07-T-0733. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-14. The associated North America Industry Classification System  (NAICS) Code 423430 and the Business Size Standard is 100.    This requirement is 100% Set Aside for Small Businesses.. The Government contemplates award of Firm-Fixed Price contract.  Description of Requirements: 1) 2400-MHZ Controller Node  X Series IN SERV S800  2 EA; 2) 2048MB Data Cache  2x1024 DIMMS  16 EA; 3) 4-Port Fibre Channel Adapter  24 EA; 4) INSERV S800 X-Series Base Configuration  1 EA; 5) Drive Chassis  40 Disk, 2 GB  4 EA; 6) 4x300GB Drive Magazine, 10 K RPM 2GB  32 EA; 7) 4x500GB Drive Magazine (FC Nearline 2GB)  8 EA; 8) 10M Fiber Cable 62.5/125 (LC-LC)  48 EA; 9) 2M Fiber Cable 62.5/125 (LC-LC)  8 EA; 10)  Inform Suite S800  4 x 300GB Magazine LTU  32 EA; 11) Inform Suite S800  4 x 500GB NL Magazine LTU  8 EA; 12) Dynamic Optimization S800  4 x 300GB Magazine LTU  32 EA; 13) Dynamic Optimization S800  4 x 500GB NL Magazine LTU  8 EA; 14) Thin Provisioning (1 TB License)  10 EA; 15) Installation and Setup 4 Nodes  1 EA; 16) 3PAR Advantage, price per node for 4, 6, and 8 nodes  4 EA; 17) 3PAR MPO for MS Windows SW Maint (11 + Hosts)  3 EA; 18) Dynamic Optimization SW Maint, Price per Node for 4, 6, 8 nodes  4 EA.  This solicitation is for Brand-Name or Equal products as described by FAR 52.211-6. The proposed storage device must have the following salient characteristics:  "	Create any size volume from 256 MBs to 2 TBs within 15 seconds either from a JAVA based GUI or an SSH command line "	Mount any volume to a server in the fabric within 15 seconds "	Using fine grained virtualization each volume should be automatically load balanced across all storage processors and all disk drives during creation without preplanning and removing the requirement for the APG DOIM to do capacity planning or performance  management "	Support volume creation templates that define Quality of Service to include: dynamic/non-disruptive RAID conversion; degree of resource utilization  massively parallel or finely restricted use of processors, drives and/or ports; radial placement  dat a placement on inner or outer tracks of disk platters; drive type  high performance or high capacity enterprise-class FC drives or economical FATA-class drives. "	Ability to create hundreds of read only snapshots on any given volume and at least 15 writable snapshots on any given volume.  Snapshots should incorporate copy on write technology in order to maximize disk space efficiency.  Must also support snapsh ots of snapshots for data warehouse/mart applications. "	Volume creation must also support a dedicate on write or thin provision capability with an easy and flexible physical quota management system in addition to the traditional dedicate on allocation volume creation.  The APG DOIM intends to over-provi sion volumes and use quota management to dramatically reduce the administrative burden of managing storage in a dynamic application environment.  For example, if the APG DOIM develops a new application and estimates a requirement for ten 100 GB volumes the  agency intends to provide ten 2 TB thin provision volumes to the host with a storage device quota set of 100 GBs for each.  The storage device will only dedicate storage to the application when writes occur.  Therefore, if the application only writes 1 50 GBs of data over the life of the project then 850 GBs would not be wasted as compared to traditional volumes.  More importantly, if the application far exceeds expected capacity a simple c hange in the storage device quota for these volumes allows the organization to expand capacity without the current onerous demands to involve storage administrators, system administrators, DBAs, and application developers.  Thin Provision volumes should h ave the  same ease of use and automatic load balancing characteristics mentioned above for volume creation. Therefore, the proposed storage system must be self contained and capable of: "	Provide 99.999% availability across the entire system including any scheduled or unscheduled downtime. "	All cache should be mirrored.  Cache should be both battery protected and in the event of a catastrophic power failure the batteries should support cache being written to disk before shutting down the storage processors.  Mirrored data should therefore b e on different disks.  Battery metrics should be tested regularly and replaced when necessary in order to provide the above. Data Replication In order to keep data replication as reliable, simple and efficient as possible the APG DOIM would like proposed system to include the following: "	Enable replication technology to be configured with just a few simple commands for ease of use, quick implementation, and pain-free maintenance.  "	Replication technology should be transport agnostic, enabling data to be transferred using different protocols over different networks. Minimally the system should provide the ability to replicate IP over Ethernet. The conversion of fibre channel to IP s hould be accomplished natively within the storage system. There should be no additional external converters or extenders needed. "	Provide the ability to replicate ONLY data that has been physically written to disk and not replicate allocated but unused storage space. "	Provide the ability to replicate storage systems either point-to-point or many-to-one offering a choice between a distributed and a centralized consolidated disaster recovery strategy  The solution should provide SQL and Exchange aware snapshot capability. This capability must integrate with the storage system snapshots and enable non-disruptive backup to tape or quick recovery of a database. The Exchange capability should also enable a  single mailbox restoration. Training The proposed system should not require any advanced training.  Any and all training should be performed on-site and should not exceed 8 hours for any device configured up to 300 TBs in size.  The intention is for the APG DOIM to dramatically reduce the bu rden of storage management through the acquisition of a new storage platform.  If the complexity of the vendors architecture requires advanced customer off-site training the vendor will be determined to be non-compliant. Delivery shall be made to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, 21005.  The following clauses will be incorporated by referrence: 52.209-6 Protecting the Governments Interest When Subcontracting with contractors debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment; 52.21 1-6 Brand Name or Equal,  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items. 52.223-11 Ozone-Depleting Substances, 52.247-34 FOB Destination.

The contract will be awarded to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The technical evaluation will be a determination based on information furnished by the vendor. The G overnment is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. The Government reserves the right to award on all or none basis.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation Number is RFP 521-07-015 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-013.  

The USAID Haiti Mission requires the services of a highly qualified polling firm to conduct seven (7) public opinion polls in Haiti over the next four (4) years. The purpose of these statistically significant polls is to assess the trends of many socio-economic and political data; to gather information on specific events or programs that receive USAID or U.S. Government assistance (such as national and local elections); to provide a better understanding of whether USAID is reaching its target populations and target geographic areas; to facilitate USAID?s understanding of local perceptions and knowledge of U.S. Government assistance in Haiti; and to help USAID track program performance indicators. 

Background:  
The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the departure of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006.  The government of President Ren? Pr?val is faced with a daunting challenge to modernize the state, undertake needed fiscal and governance reforms, re-establish security and re-launch the economy.  In July 2006, Haiti held a successful donors conference in which the international donor community pledged $750 million to support the government?s development priorities.    

According to the CIA World Fact Book, Haiti has an estimated 8.7 million residents.  The country has 10 Administrative Departments and 140 Communes for decentralized administrative purposes.  80% of the Haitian population lives under the poverty line and 54% live in abject poverty. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. A macroeconomic program developed in 2005 with the help of the International Monetary Fund helped the economy grow 1.8% in 2006, the highest growth rate since 1999. 

Since 1999, USAID/Haiti has conducted opinion polls to measure Haitian citizens? beliefs and perceptions on various political and socio-economic topics related to civil rights and responsibilities, government performance, electoral participation and political parties.   

Description of Services:
The contractor shall provide seven nation-wide statistically significant public opinion polls that include a representative sampling of the Haitian people.  The polls will be conducted in Creole.  Data from these polls must be disaggregated by gender (male/female) and geographic location of the respondents by Department and Commune.  There are 10 Departments and 140 Communes.  The polls will be completed according to the following delivery schedule, in consultation with USAID?s CTO and in accordance with actual events in Haiti (e.g., elections).  

CLIN:	Delivery Date:
01 ? Public Opinion Poll #1 (baseline poll)TBD with USAID CTO at time of contract signing
02 ? Public Opinion Poll #2 TBD; usually 4-6 months since last poll
03 ? Public Opinion Poll #3 TBD; usually 4-6 months since last poll
04 ? Public Opinion Poll #4 TBD; usually 4-6 months since last poll

06 ? Public Opinion Poll #6 TBD; usually 4-6 months since last poll

<DESC>Amendment 0002, June 14, 2007
Subject: NAMA-07-R-0010
Site Visit Q&A

A site visit was conducted today i.a.w the subject RFP, and the following questions and answers were given.
1-Question:  Can you define the fields of the records and define the metadata required for index after capture?
Answer:  NARA?s records are organized based on the agency that created the records. The highest level of the descriptive hierarchy is the Record Group, which are the records of a particular agency. Under a Record Group there are one or more (usually many) Series that define groups of records created by the agency. The next step down in the hierarchy is the File Unit; file unit is flexible and may be a box of records or may be a folder within a box of records. The lowest level in the hierarch is the individual record represented by an Item Level description. Information on this topic is available at - http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/data.html and http://www.archivists.org/catalog/stds99/index.html.

2-Question:  Is there a Minimum descriptive Metadata or higher level data identification?
Answer:  Minimum metadata requirements are addressed in general in NARA?s Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access: Creation of Production Master Files ? Raster Images, June 2004 ? available at http://www.archives.gov/preservation/technical/guidelines.pdf.? Other specific descriptive metadata requirements are addressed in NARA?s Life Cycle Data Requirements Guide, available at http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/lifecycle-data-requirements.doc (see Appendix C of the NARA?s Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access: Creation of Production Master Files ? Raster Images, June 2004 for the minimum or mandatory metadata elements).

3-Question:  Do you digitize Classified documents?
Answer:  No, not in the NWTS Special Media Preservation Labs, all items received for reformatting are unclassified.

4-Question:  You use some auto feed machines, are historically significant documents auto fed, or hand fed?
Answer:  Historically significant materials are all hand fed. 

5- Question: How many servers are currently used?
Answer:  Currently the NWTS Labs manage three network attachable storage servers, expansion will be on a local preservation lab level.  Lab servers are not connected to NARA?s IT network.  The lab plans to add more network attachable storage.  All existing workflows are separate, the goal is to tie the preservation lab work together.  Please reference the RFP.

6- Question: Will Macintosh computers be involved?
Answer: Yes.  Some of the older scanners were Mac only, now we have equipment that is Windows capable, we will continue using both Macintosh and Windows workstations.  All are operational and will be a part of the expansion of our digital system in the preservation laboratory.

7-Question:  Will custom configuration of the workstations be required?
Answer:  We are looking for brand name or equal that meets the minimum requirements already expressed in the RFP.

8- Question:  Is there an expected delivery schedule?
Answer: We are expecting vendors to propose a delivery schedule, and the proposed schedule will be evaluated as part of the technical evaluation.

9-Question: Is there a specification of metadata used for repository storage or long-term management of the digital resources?
Answer:  Please see the RFP referencing Metadata, and referenced on line under Lifecycle data.  (Please see web information in answer number 2 above)

10-Question: Referencing metadata, when is it captured?
Answer:  The point of capture or creation will vary. It is captured depending on the group or record received in the preservation laboratory.  In some cases we may receive metadata from databases or spreadsheets maintained by other department, and we will use it to manage the digitization process and add additional metadata. Also, metadata may be collected at time of conversion or after digitization is completed.

11-Question: Is there a page number for all items to be digitized when metadata is provided from a database?
Answer:  For textual records, individual pages are not tracked in existing databases.

12- Question: Is there a page number on the objects?
Answer:  That depends on the item being reformatted, so the answer is Yes and No. Some records may have page numbers; more often than not, the individual pages are not uniquely identified on the original records. We microfilm or digitize the records in the sequence they are delivered to the laboratories.

13-Question:  In the RFP specification I did not see if you are digitizing two pages at once (with bound volumes) or pages of differing sizes.
Answer:  Actually, the preservation laboratory digitizes every size imaginable, but the majority of work is with letter sized, loose or individual documents.  The documents are not always in a bound format, but we do reformat bound documents that can be up to 20 x 30 inches.  Approximately 90% of the preservation work is small loose leaf paper documents.
The specification in the RFP refers to work stations with changeable devices. 

14- Question:  Does metadata have to be in a specific format when transmitted?
Answer:  Please refer to the RFP which states the formats that will meet the stated requirements.

15-Question:  Does more than one project go on at one time?
Answer:  Yes.  Projects can take years to complete or any smaller unit of time.  Everything depends on the projects or delivered to the lab for reformatting. Also, the labs work on multiple projects at the same time. 

16-Question: Is there any documentation that describes the indexing process in more detail?
Answer: The specification defines the objectives we have in regards to workflow management and indexing, and we are expecting vendors to provide proposal for workflow management and indexing that meet our objectives.

Final Questions and Answers NAMA-07-R-0010
Quote due No Later Than 3:00 PM, June 20, 2007

Question - This is not a color system correct?     
Answer - Correct, both the roll-film microfilm and microfiche scanners are to produce grayscale or bi-tonal images, they are not color scanners.

Question - Should we ignore the speed issues for Production Environment for the microfiche scanner?     
Answer - The production capacity cited in the RFP is incorrect, the production capacity for microfiche scanners should be 15,000 to 35,000 images per day.

Question- Will remote access to the scan stations and server be allowed for 
support purposes?
Answer- At this time, remote access is not possible. We are working on trying to make it possible.

Question- If remote access is allowed, does the NARA have existing preferred 
remote access software to be installed on the systems, or will that be 
up to the contractor to provide?
Answer- Since currently there is no remote access, we do not have a preferred remote access software application at this time.

Question- Will the NARA be providing the equipment and media to perform the backups, or should this be included in the proposal?
Answer: Mass digital storage and back-up of digital files is not part of this acquisition. NARA is working on these needs and functionality separately.

Question- How many different digitization projects will be going on during the 
period of performance?
Answer: The number of projects at any given time will vary. Typically, it may be between 8 and 16 on-going or longer-term projects across all of our lab areas, and many individual work requests.

Question- The document mentions that the local network shared drives are currently being backed up to tape devices.  I did not see any other mention of a backup strategy for the integrated system.
Answer:  NARA is working on the Electronic Records Archives (ERA, info at- http://www.archives.gov/era/). All digital copies we create using the equipment to be purchased under this acquisition will likely be stored and managed over the long-term in the ERA infrastructure.

PART I, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR TEXTUAL RECORDS DIGITATION ENVIRONMENT 1.0  INTRODUCTION The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain all equipment and labor necessary to procure operational new workstations that will provide an expanded capability for the digitization/scanning of textual records at Archives II in College Park Maryland.  The workstations include the accompanying server/software and data deliverables and maintenance of the workstations for a base year with two possible option years described in this statement of work, along with industry standard warranties for the equipment and system.  Existing work stations as described below will also be required to integrate with the new workstations. Statement of Need, Background and Objectives: The Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration needs to expand capabilities for the digitization/scanning of textual records. Currently, the Microfilm Camera Lab of the Special Media Preservation Laboratory operates sixteen (16) traditional planetary-style 35mm microfilm cameras. We anticipate replacing these microfilm cameras over a period of several years with new digital camera systems with indexing software to be used for digitizing a variety of original records. The NWTS labs operate two microfilm scanners (an older roll-film scanner and a newer microfiche scanner) and needs to expand microfilm scanning capabilities. Also, the labs use several high-speed document scanners. All these systems need to be integrated into an environment for digitizing and indexing textual records using a software application for workflow management and document indexing. The existing Special Media Preservation (NWTS) Environment. The NWTS Labs are creating a local area network (LAN) which is comprised of lab equipment (scanners, digital cameras, printers, audio and video capture and playback devices) and the computers used to host the applications that run these devices, as well as the digital storage systems to hold the digital output and servers that manage this entire array of devices. Each lab (audio and video, still photo/digital imaging/aerial/cartographic, motion picture, microfilm camera, and microfilm duplication) has workstations used to capture and prepare digital output from the reformatting devices. The digital resources are saved to a local network attached storage (NAS) server (typically 6 TB to 7 TB of RAID-5 storage with tape back-up and an uninterruptible power supply) that is dedicated to each lab for short-term storage. Digital resources saved to the NAS servers are backed up daily to LTO tapes by project, and copies of the tapes are transferred to protected storage for the duration of the project. Quality control checks are made by technicians during the course of a project and at its completion.  Once approved, the project resources (digital files and related metadata) will be transferred to a centralized storage area network (SAN) managed by NARAs IT department. Daily LTO backups are made of data stored on the SAN. Due to the necessity of choosing workstations and operating systems based upon lab equipment and application needs, servers running Active Directory (Microsoft) and Open Directory (Apple Computing) are used simultaneously to manage the lab network environment. Managed Gigabit switches are used at the workgroup level to provide adequate network throughput between the workstations and local network attachable storage, as well as part of LAN security. Fiber based switches are used to connect the workgroup switches and network attachable storage, as well as providing a link to the centralized SAN. All the equipment and software procured for the textual records digitization environment will be integrated into the NWTS lab environment. Other existing equipment to be used in this environment with the workflow management and document indexing software include-Zeutschel OS 10000TT book scanner-Fujitsu fi-4750c document scanner-Kodak i620 and i1320 document scanners-Sunrise Proscan 2000 microfilm scanner -Wicks & Wilson FS300 microfiche scanner-Various photograph digitizing workstations - Workstations for existing equipment are various Windows based computers.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N860010-7-05927rs is issued as a request for quotation. No set-aside is identified for this RFP. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for technical support services described below.  The Performance Based Statement of Work is as follows:

I.	BACKGROUND:
The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) studies building materials; computer-integrated construction practices; fire science and fire safety engineering; and structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Products of the laboratory's research include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and technical data that support innovations by industry and are incorporated into building and fire standards and codes. One of BFRL?s major program areas is Healthy and Sustainable Buildings, to which the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software project is a major contributor.  BEES uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the environmental performance of products based on life-cycle inventory (LCI) data compiled by LCA practitioners for more than 500 environmental flows including raw materials and energy use, air emissions, water effluent, and solid waste. 

NIST takes a lead role, with its BEES software, database, and methods, in providing guidance to the building community on the life cycle environmental and economic performance of products.  Reliable, consistent LCI data are key to BEES success. 

II.	SCOPE OF WORK:
With this contract, NIST seeks to take a first step beyond evaluation of building products and simple building product systems toward evaluation of entire facilities. The scope of this contract is limited to commercial and residential buildings. 

The primary objective of this contract is for a Contractor to develop a mapping framework to directly connect an existing, or readily-adaptable, Input/Output (I/O)-based LCI framework with the fixed, BEES-based LCI framework.  The Contractor is encouraged to propose an innovative and effective methodology to map BEES life cycle flows.

The deliverable for this contract is a spreadsheet indicating how to convert I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. This deliverable will be reviewed and incorporated by the NIST COTR in the research activities of the BFRL Metrics and Tools for Sustainable Buildings Program. The Contractor may propose and justify an alternative deliverable for Government approval.  The goal of the deliverable is to effectively and efficiently convert I/O LCI results into the BEES-based LCI framework.  The objective is to enable evaluation I/O LCI results through the twelve BEES impact assessment methods.

The expected outcome is the ability to estimate, in a consistent, transparent manner, the environmental performance of commercial and residential buildings 

Period of Performance - The period of performance is from date of award through 29 FEB 2008.

III.	SPECIFIC TASKS:
The Contractor shall develop a mapping framework for converting I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. Specific tasks include:

1.	Select a robust, transparent U.S. IO-LCA database.  Publicly or commercially available documentation shall exist for the selected database that provides detailed, transparent information on its compilation.  Robustness shall be demonstrated by reference to at least two independent, 3rd-party reviews of the selected database. 

2.	Map the LCI flows produced as output of the selected IO-LCA database to the BEES LCI flows. Attached is an Excel file (PWS Attachment #1) giving the fixed BEES LCI flow list, the environmental media to which they refer, and the units in which they are expressed. 

3.	Document matched flows. For IO-LCA database flows with direct, or convertible, mappings to BEES flows, document the match. See the ?Matched Flows? tab of  PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all matched flows. As shown in the attachment, for each matched flow, list the corresponding flow from the selected IO-LCA database. Provide the units in which the IO-LCA database reports these corresponding flows, as well as their CAS Registry numbers if they exist.

4.	Document unmatched flows. For IO-LCA database flows without direct or convertible mappings to BEES flows, document the matching failure. See the ?Unmatched Flows? tab of  PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all unmatched flows. As shown in the attachment, documentation includes type of mismatch between BEES flows and IO-LCA flows and suggested work-around, other suggestion as to how to handle the unmatch, or justification for ignoring the BEES flow (e.g., insignificant--x %- contribution to all 12 BEES environmental impacts)


NOTE: For PBSW attachments # 1 & #2 may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to thee acquisition specialist identified below.


IV.	DELIVERABLES AND REPORTS:

<CONTACT>Camille Jones, (256) 876-3080
<DESC>This amendment 01 is issued to respond to offeror's questions. QUESTION 1. In regards to the below solicitation, we are wondering if there are more evaluation criteria?  As stated in the solicitation, the criteria are the items in section 3.12, which  are fairly easy to meet. Is the Government selecting a pre-determined number BPA holders per each GSA Schedule type (i.e. Schedules 70, 41, 95, etc.)?  If we want to bid on future task orders for the various GSA Schedules that we currently are not on, mus t we describe our team in this initial proposal or will that be considered at the task order level?  That is, for instance, we have a partner that provides power backup, which is not on our GSA 70 schedule (obviously), but is on our partners Schedule 61. Must we propose them as subcontractors at this point in order to receive future consideration for a GSA Schedule 61 item? ANSWER 1.  It is not the intent of the USA AMCOM to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against GSA Schedules. Offerors proposing  BPAs against GSA schedules are not in compliance with the solicitation and will not be considered. QUESTION 2. I have a question about the NAICS code listed on solicitation number W31P4Q-07-T-0552.  The size standard for NAICS 423430 is 100 employees; on the solicitation the small business size standard states 500 employees.  Could you please confirm? ANSWER 2. The correct size standard for this solicitation is 500 employees. QUESTION 3. I meet all the criteria outlined in your solicitation except one: I a m not adjacent to Redstone Arsenal, AL. ANSWER 3:  Offerors must be within 60 miles of Gate 1, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.  Offerors are required to certify that their facilities involved in the ordering and receipt of equipment purchased under the BPA are within 60 miles of Gate 1 at Redstone Arsenal, AL, and this location must be registered in the CCR at the time of the offerors proposal submission.  The closing date and time remains 4:00 PM CST 31 Aug 2007.

<CONTACT>jeanene.gerstenkorn, 719-526-1952
<DESC>Question:  Who is the current contractor?  Answer:  There currently is no contractor because a contract is not in place at this time.  Question:  When is the post guide and map scheduled to be out or when does it publish?  Answer:  Not later than 15 January 2008.  Question:  Is this restricted to small business?  Answer:  No.  It is unrestricted in accordance with DODI 5120.4, paragraph E4.1.10.2.  Question:  According to section C.1.2.1.2. The Contract Manager or alternate(s), shall be available from  7:30 a.m. through 5 p.m. MST/MDT on weekday duty hours, within 60 minutes after notification, to meet on the installation with Government personnel designated by the Contracting Officer to discuss problem areas.  After normal duty hours, the Contract Mana ger or designated alternate(s) shall be available within 2 hours after notification.  Does this mean that person has to be within that distance year round?  Or is it just during the time frame that the post guide is being put together?  Answer:  The Public  Affairs Office would like a local point of contact during the time frame the post guide is being put together.  It doesnt need to be the primary Contract Manager, but someone the Public Affairs Office can talk to face-to-face.  Question:  Can you provide  me with a copy of the current Post Guide?  Answer:  Please request a copy of the Post Guide via e-mail at Jeanene.Gerstenkorn@us.army.mil and I will e-mail you an electronic copy.
