<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, CA, located at 1325 J Street CA 95814-2922 to negotiate a sole source award with TEPA EC LLC, 350 J Street, Beale AFB CA 95903 to Repair Substation and Switchgear at Building 2143, Beale AFB, CA (NAICS 237130). The value of this acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency; specifically, FAR 6.302-5(b)(4) for sole source awards under the 8(a) program 15 U.S.C. 637 and in accordance with FAR 19.805-1(b)(2), as the SBA has set aside this requirement on behalf of a concern owned by an Indian tribe. The authority cited and justification made is based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available from one source.<br /><br />Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&amp;A is not required for this award.<br /></p>
