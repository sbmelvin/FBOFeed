<DESC>The Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES) is tasked to provide a system that assists Service members in receiving civilian recognition and academic credit for education and training experienced while in the Service based on a review by the civilian education community of the courses, programs, occupational environment, and other training experiences offered by the Services. The basic objective of the program is to provide a system whereby representatives of American higher education examine learning experiences occurring within the Military Services to determine the comparability of those experiences with those in the civilian post secondary education community so that where applicable learning achieved in the military can be applied to a college degree or a vocational credential that can lead to career and educational advancement.

On the basis of the evaluations, the Contractor shall establish credit recommendations for the learning experienced by Service personnel and communicate those credit recommendations to the military and civilian education communities.  It is the Contractor's responsibility to actively assist colleges and universities, military advisors, students, and other appropriate agencies in understanding and using the credit recommendations and evaluations.  The Contractor must not only advise the military of the policies and practices of the civilian education community, but also must verify to the civilian community the quality of learning occurring within the military.  The Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating a variety of military educational and training experiences in which Service members and veterans participate: these may include service school courses and programs, qualified military occupational specialties (MOSs), Coast Guard and Navy ratings, rates, and NECs (Navy Enlisted Classifications).  The Contractor shall also maintain records and files on the evaluations, and research and write manuscripts and copy for use as DANTES publications, organize and operate an advisory service and maintain records.

For the evaluations to be widely accepted, the Contractor must demonstrate wide involvement with American higher education and possess the highest professional reputation to support its recommendations and policies.  Therefore,  FISC Norfolk Contracts Department Philadelphia Division intends acquire the required services in support of DANTES’ Evaluation of Military Education Experience Program from the American Council on Education. A cost plus fixed fee type contract for a base period extending from 01 October 2007 through 30 September 2008 with three possible 12-month Option Periods is anticipated.  Numbered Notes #22 and #26 apply.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-07-T-1601. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a sole source basis a firm-fixed price contract to Carleton Technologies Incorporated, Tampa, Florida to provide long lead time items to support the manufacture of Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Upgraded Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UUBA).  The UUBA is defined as a MK 16 MOD 0 Underwater Breathing Apparatus with an upgrade kit installed.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Carleton Technologies is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MK 16 UBA.  As the OEM, o!  nly Carleton Technologies can accurately provide all of the long lead time items for the MK 16 to successfully transition the system to UUBA.  Procuring these long lead time items  from another company would run the risk of incompatibility of components when assembling the upgrades.  Furthermore, the Mk16 is a certified life support system.  As such, only approved components can be used on the system.  In summary, Carleton Technologies is the only responsible source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK16 UBA.  Use of another company to provide the long lead time items for the MK 16 would result in extensive requalification and certification testing which is cost and time prohibitive.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for High Resolution Rotating Mirror Digitized Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) Camera Model 550-62 (1 each), 605 High Intensity Light Source (1 each), and a Model 1500 Camera Stand (1 each). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Cordin Company, Inc. The high resolution rotating mirror camera purchased will be used to aid in the design, development, and test operations of the new pyrotechnic hardware.  This camera system is capable to observe the fracturing of items subject to explosives shocks, the observation of effects of detonation pressure waves on sub-assembly parts, and other pyrotechnic phenomena.  It will be able to obtain high speed images without the aid of peripheral devices and subsequent degradation of image quality.  A high speed rotating mirror will provide optical clarity and quality.  The camera system shall be capable of 4 million frames per second that will provide a minimum of 1,000 x 1,000 pixel resolution at all user selectable framing rate.  A market survey has revealed that Cordin products will allow NASA/JSC to gain the ability to effectively capture, measure, and evaluate data.  During the development of new pyrotechnic devices and hardware, a complete and thorough understanding of the behavior of these devices is critical to the application to which these new devices are to be applied and the subsequent effects to other systems. Cordin Model 550-62 High Resolution Rotating Mirror is the only camera system that can meet technical and image quality requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 16, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Integration of Ultrasonic Assisted (UA) Technology into stir welding processes.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase this effort from Edison Welding Institute, Columbus, Ohio, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The Edison Welding Institute is a non-profit, membership-based organization that provides metals joining expertise in the area of welding process selection, optimization, troubleshooting, and research.	The Edison Welding Institute is the largest industrial consortium dedicated to welding in the United States with an estimated $9.0 Million annual applied research program dedicated to metals joining procedures and process development, which makes it the only source with the resources to address critical welding issues.  There are no other organizations in the U. S., which offer these services.  MSFC is a member of The Edison Welding Institute. 2.  Membership in the Edison Welding Institute enables NASA personnel to have direct access to a broad array of researchers and analysts with expertise in the welding of aerospace materials.  This expertise has been a direct benefit in the realm of NASA welding activities including, but not limited to: resolution of weld cracking in the Super Lightweight External Tank Program, microfissure elimination in the Space Shuttle Main Engine Program, the development of the friction stir weld process, and providing other welding support services to NASA and aerospace contractors.  The development of ultrasonic technology for stir welding equipment requires an array of researchers and analysts not found in other companies or organizations.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 23, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SUBJECT>B -- Investigate Effects of wear and use on protective clothing materials
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0000HCCL-2007-42147
<RESPDATE>042407
<ARCHDATE>05092007
<CONTACT>Margaret Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Phone (412)386-6431, Fax (412)386-6843, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Helath, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has a requirement for Development and Validation of PPE Lab Preconditioning Methods.  

A.  Purpose of Contract

The purpose of this contract is to investigate the effects of wear and use on protective clothing materials in order to recommend specific methods that can be used to evaluate the barrier qualities of clothing materials over their expected service life. The specific objective of this contract is to recommend approaches and methods that can become ASTM standards or be incorporated into NFPA standards that address CBRN protection of first responders in reusable clothing and equipment.

B.  Statement of Work

The work effort covers a 2-year research program.  The first year involves the identification and development of specific preconditioning techniques for selected PPE ensembles and mission areas. This process will entail observing the conditions of wear for clothing based on repeated, documented use, the evaluation of potential techniques for simulating the types of observed wear, the consequent creation of a detailed test plan, conduct of an external peer review and formation of a project team with establishment of supporting capabilities at different laboratories.  The second year effort will address validation and implementation of recommended preconditioning techniques into NFPA and ASTM protective clothing standards through the development of new procedures, practices, and tests methods, as needed, with the final deliverable being a final peer reviewed technical report discussing all activities and findings of the project. 

C.  Detailed Technical Requirements:

During the first year of the project, the contractor shall use the following specific steps as part of their investigations:

1.	Propose the key ensemble material and use parameters to be investigated for determining the durability of barrier protection in protective clothing materials against CBRN agents and other hazardous substances. Proposals should address all elements that incorporate CBRN barrier materials. Determine the types of ensembles and respective standards to be targeted as part of the work effort.

2.	Research specific conditions of clothing that result from its use and care by examining a large number of clothing sets exhibiting different levels of wear where the service life of the clothing is well understood. Devise potential approaches for linking the condition of clothing to its documented use and care. Interview key end user stakeholders and manufacturers for determining how field observations relate to clothing barrier performance. Document the findings of this research to be included as part of the detailed, comprehensive test plan described in Task 5.

3.	Conduct a review of current procedures that are applied in different specifications, including NFPA and other standards, for protective ensembles and elements, which document how clothing items and materials are preconditioned prior to barrier or other forms of testing. The review shall include a literature search and investigation of prior studies performed on first responder and related clothing and equipment. Document the findings of this review to be included as part of the detailed, comprehensive test plan described in Task 5.

4.	Perform limited testing to determine the appropriateness of test methods and to allow for the narrowing of selected preconditioning techniques to be considered as part of a detailed, comprehensive test plan. Document the findings of this testing to be included as part of the detailed, comprehensive test plan described in Task 5.

5.	Prepare a detailed, comprehensive plan to investigate the application of selected preconditioning methods to specific materials for simulated use and care. The test plan shall include the results of the research and reviews conducted in Tasks 1 through 4. The test plan should identify specific materials to be tested, the types of testing to be conducted, how the materials are to be tested, how results will be reported, and how criteria will be established to determine if proposed preconditioning methods are appropriate for modeling ensemble wear. The detailed, comprehensive plan should be submitted for external peer review.

6.	Respond to comments from the external peer review with specific changes in the detailed, comprehensive test plan. Conduct additional reviews, research, and testing as needed to address and identified deficiencies in the detailed, comprehensive test plan. The contractor shall prepare a revised detailed, comprehensive test plan that incorporates all changes.

7.	Make arrangements for carrying out the execution of the comprehensive, detailed test plan. These arrangements shall include establishment of a project team to carrying out the plan and identifying specific facilities where evaluations will be carried out.

During the second year of the project, the contractor shall:
	
8.	Provide an interim report on initial testing to determine the appropriateness of preconditioning techniques for specific protective ensembles.

9.	Prepare a report on validation of preconditioning techniques and how each investigated technique simulated wear and care of different protective ensembles.

10.	Investigate potential techniques that may be used in the field to monitor or assess the condition of barrier materials and their efficacy in providing continued CBRN protection. Findings of this investigation shall be provided in the project final report.

11.	Create recommendations for specific preconditioning techniques in revision of specific protective ensemble standards. The proposed techniques shall be prepared in the appropriate style and form for the respective ASTM and NFPA standards as consistent with the standards to be affected. The project team shall prepare all recommendations for direct submission to the appropriate standards organization and make the submission.

12.	Prepare a manuscript as a co-author with the Government Technical Project Officer for submission to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

13.	Complete a final report with all project data and findings.  

Note:  Stakeholders for this project include certification organizations, standards development organizations, manufacturers, first responders and the DHS Office for Grants and Training federal equipment grant programs for local/state agencies. The end result of this project is a series of conditioning techniques that can be applied to protective ensemble materials to mimic wear and use for demonstrating how barrier protection is sustained with multiple-uses.  By determining realistic preconditioning procedures that simulate real world use on these ensembles, the industry will be able to provide a wider range of NFPA certified products to the estimated 1.5 million first responders for use during CBRN incidents.  This means that first responders have the opportunity to be outfitted in durable, less stressful ensembles with the latest technology when they find themselves in a CBRN incident.

D.   Period of Performance

The Contractor shall complete the technical effort specified under Section C, within twenty one (21) months after the effective date of the contract. The anticipated term of the contract, including time allowed for draft approval and submission of the approved final report, is twenty four (24) months after the effective date of the contract.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:  Margaret L. Mooney, Reference 0000HCCL-2007-42147, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15236,  MMooney@cdc.gov.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.   

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with International Personnel Protection (IPP) as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

The primary reason for selecting this entity is the research described under this contract is required to be performed by a current member of the following four NFPA Technical Committees (TC): Structural and Proximity Firefighting Protective Clothing, Special Operations Protective Clothing and Equipment, Hazardous Materials Emergencies Protective Clothing and Equipment and Emergency Medical Protective Clothing and Equipment.  The interactions required with the TCs to conduct and complete the research within the NFPA revision cycle can only be completed by a member.  Mr. Jeffery O. Stull, President of International Personnel Protection, has over 23 years of experience in the study of personal protective equipment with the United States Coast Guard, TRI/Environemental and as President of International Personnel Protection, Inc.  Mr. Stull has been an active member of and a significant contributor to the TCs since their creation.  Mr. Stull was also involved with the US Fire Administration efforts to create the TCs.  His expertise and background with these Technical Committees is an irreplaceable asset to the project, as the project will require guidance and support from the committee to affect change during the appropriate times of the revision cycle of the standard.  The contractor shall also be a current member of the ASTM F23 Committee on Protective Clothing.  The work under this contract will require the review of several ASTM methods and may require additional new ASTM test methods which can only be completed by a current ASTM F23 member.  Mr. Stull is not only a member but is currently the Chairman for the ASTM F23 Committee and the Head of the United States Delegation for two ISO Subcommittees.  The research described in this contract requires testing at multiple test laboratories due to the differing capabilities of the labs.  Many of these labs require contracts or agreements to be completed before testing can begin.  IPP has already secured testing agreements with all of the required test labs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is planning  to issue a solicitation for the molding of  composite materials for an improved increment protector (IIP) design for 120mm  mortar ammunition.  Materials need to have the ability to be molded by common  processes, preferably injection molding.  The improved increment protector  design will be similar in design to the existing propelling charge support.   Protectors will meet performance requirements of drop testing (3 ft and 7 ft)  and vibration (secured and loose cargo) testing at -60Â°F, ambient, and +160Â°F  temperature extremes without causing damage to the propelling charges packed  within.  The protector design must be made from material that will retain its  dimensions (no warpage) during fabrication and use of the parts.  Foam lining  on the interior of the protector will be required to ensure a tight fit for  the propelling charges.  Offerors will need to fabricate a prototype mold of  the protector design and produce 50 sets of protectors for engineering  testing.  Upon successful completion of the engineering tests, the offeror  will fabricate a production mold of the final protector design and produce 200  sets of protectors for product verification testing.   Solicitation will be  available @     http://procnet.pica.army on or about 24 April 07. Reference  note 26.

<DESC>The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, and supplies necessary to ensure that the trash rack is clear enough of vegetation that it allows a minimum of 10 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water to pass through (historically this requires no l ess then 4 site visit per week variable with weather conditions and water flow).  The rack shall be cleared in a manner that allows water to pass through the culvert and normally consists of working the vegetation out of the trash rack, removing woody debr is, and freeing the rack from any other natural or man-made debris that floats into the intake. Traditionally this work has been completed using either basic landscaping tools (e.g. rake, shovel) or by hand.

Equipment listed above are required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that require two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as key components of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only.  GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis for the use of Verity, Inc./Autonomy software and it’s maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for the maintenance of the Department of State’s historical automated archive system – called the State Archiving System – the Cable Archive Retrieval System (CARS), and FOIA Internet web site, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. A/ISS/IPS/AAS has a requirement to continue software maintenance (including software patches, updates and technical notes) for our Verity K2 software licenses used to support the State Archiving System (SAS), Cable Retrieval System (CARS), and FOIA Internet web site.  The necessary Verity K@ software patches, updates, and technical notices are only available through Verity/Autonomy. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s automated archived foreign policy files.<BR><BR>

FFP is requesting a yearly subscription to this system for 100 concurrent users be acquired along with two servers on which to run the database. The EDISON software application will provide the basic images of passports, visas, and other travel documents from around the world.  The application in conjunction with the EDISON hardware will have the following capabilities: show watermarks within documents, show retro-reflective features on documents, show UV activated features on documents, show holograms on documents. The EDISON’s web-based Travel Document Database system and software application meets all of CS/FPP’ technical requirements and is known as a standard in the business.  The EDISON program is an intergovernmental consortium, led by the Dutch with cooperation from Australia, Canada, and the United States.  DHS’ Forensic Document Laboratory contributes to EDISON document exemplars, some of which originate with CA.  The database is published in various forms, including books, a commercially available internet-based program, and government-only versions. The version FPP propose to procure is a government “Control” level which is available in electronic form with no need to install on individual PCs.  This version has also been procured by DHS’s Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for use at U.S Ports of Entry. Based on the technical capability of EDISON it has been determined that another viable source would not be able to provide CA/FFP with compatible software application to compliment the already purchased hardware<BR><BR>

United States Department of Transportation’s (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price Contract, the Period of Performance is 12 months after award to Enterprise-Elements for the following items.
1) Elements Repository w/ 5 concurrent licenses - The Elements Repository is specifically designed for the management and analysis of dynamic, highly-interrelated data and metadata. The Elements Repository can manage the complete lifecycle of information – from initial input through review, versioning, analysis, reporting and retirement – or can act as an analytical warehouse of information drawn from other sources, such as modeling tools, ERP systems, asset management systems, etc. Elements Repository is also a powerful platform for developing custom repository-based applications. (1/each)
2) Repository Annual Maintenance Fee – The annual maintenance fee covers all upgrades and technical support for the year. (1/each)
3) Concurrent Licenses GTS – Concurrent licenses allow users to access the repository simultaneously.  These users have access to all features of the software, including metamodel creation/modification, user management, import/export utilities and modification of data. (30/each)
4) Levels I & II Maintenance Fee - The annual maintenance fee covers all upgrades and technical support for the year. (30/each)
5) Read-Only License – Unlimited – This is for an unlimited number of read-only users.  These users can browse, run reports, customize desktops, search the data in the repository, as well as provide feedback on the information using discussion threads. (1/each)
6) Read-Only License Annual Maintenance Fee - The annual maintenance fee covers all upgrades and technical support for the year. (1/each)
7) Elements Onsite 2-day Training Class - Enterprise Elements Functional Training covers all end-user features and functions, including Portal, eDiagram Manager, eExplorer, Link Matrix and overall usage principles.  It also includes an overview of the extensibility capabilities of the Elements platform, but not detailed coverage of how the extensibility is performed.  The intended audience is project team members who will be designated expert users and individuals who will be specifying requirements for product configuration and customization. (for three people)
8) Elements Consulting/Mentoring – Enterprise Elements specializes in implementing the Elements Repository.  Consulting and mentoring can include functions such as metamodel/framework definition, query & report implementation and standards development.  Exact requirements will be developed by NHSTA upon purchase and implementation. (approximately 360 hours)

This requirement is a non-competitive acquisition and no solicitation is available. The proposed acquisition is for Elements Repository Software Licenses and Maintenance Requirements which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Enterprise-Elements in accordance with FAR 6.302.1.  The Elements Repository is specifically designed for the management and analysis of dynamic, highly-interrelated data and metadata which satisfy NHTSA’s and DOT’s necessity for managing large volumes of information in accordance with its numerous complex database process environments.  The determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.  For additional information, please contact Earnest Jenkins via e-mail at earnest.jenkins@dot.gov.

<DESC>On April 25, 2007, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Information Forum for interested parties regarding GSA?s proposed plan for the Elbert P. Tuttle Court of Appeals Building in Atlanta, Georgia.  This Forum will be held in the Equitable Building, 100 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA  30303 from 10:00am to 12:00pm in the fifth floor conference room.  

The agenda for the Forum will include a presentation of the scope of the design-build contract and an overview of the procurement process for the design-build contract followed by a question and answer period.  Following the Forum, there will be an optional guided walking tour of the buildings to be rehabilitated which are located two blocks from the Equitable Building where the Forum is to be held.

The proposed Tuttle Annex will provide administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The project consists of: 1) the rehabilitation and adaptive use of two existing historic buildings located behind the Tuttle Courthouse in the Fairlie Popular Historic District and 2) new construction of ancillary space including a security screening area, loading dock, solid waste disposal/storage, underground secure parking, and a pedestrian tunnel between the annex and the existing Tuttle Courthouse.  The area of the two existing historic buildings to be rehabilitated is approximately 123,000 gsf, while the area of new construction totals approximately 11,000 gsf for a total project area of approximately 134,000 gsf.  


General construction, design-build, A/E, and other subcontractor and consulting firms capable of providing or teaming with other firms to provide design-build services will have an opportunity to learn about the project, the process for selecting the design-build contractor, participate in a question and answer session, and tour the existing buildings to be rehabilitated. 

THIS IS NOT AN REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

Questions regarding this Forum should be directed to PAUL DEHAVEN, PROJECT MANAGER, 404-331-5329 OR PAULA MENSAH, CONTRACTING OFFICER, 404-331-2748 email paulal.mensah@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The response date for this Sources Sought is changed to 16 April 2007. Responses via email are acceptable. Web Based E-Learning for Saudi Arabia This is a combined Sources Sought and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)  Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor  does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This  synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any  purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This  Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United  States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for the upgrade of the Royal  Saudi Air Force (RSAF) School of Command, Control and Communications  (School of C3) at Prince Sultan Air Base, located in Al Kharj, Saudi  Arabia.  In addition, we are also asking that each interested source  provide this office with an estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude) of their  perceived overall cost of this requirement based on the known requirements  and the Statement of Work (attached). Specifically, the contractor will provide all engineering services to  fabricate/procure, install and deliver to the RSAF a turnkey system  totally modernizing a minimum of eleven (11) up to a maximum of twenty  three (23) classrooms at the School of C3. In this effort the contractor will be required to include the networking  of classrooms, replacement and upgrading of student and instructor  workstations, integration of electronic presentation aids, and  modernization/rehabilitation of the classrooms.  The RSAF has also stated  that they wanted to migrate the current 1,502 Computer Based Training  modules from a Macintosh based system to a “state-of-the-art” PC based  system.  This effort specifically requires that the contractor re-validate  and modernize the training course content and that the course content  reflects the configuration of the newly installed equipment.  The RSAF has  also stressed their desire to accomplish distance learning, which also  includes two-way voice and data communications along with a redesign and  installation of the Local Area Network(LAN). Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly  voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is  submitted by respondents to this synopsis.  The Government requests  interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no  later than 4:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on 16 April 2007 via email  (see email address shown below)or to the following address:  For first  class mail -  AFSAC/PKT Attn: Jeff Smith, Bldg. 210, Area C, 1822 Van  Patten Drive, WPAFB Ohio 45433-5337.

The US Army is evaluating the potential for a contractor partner to operate a Government Owned, Contractor Operated (GOCO) manned aerial Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RISTA) system deploying to worldwide locations in support of the war on terrorism.  This contract will encompass all tasks associated with the development of new systems, sustainment and modernization of existing systems, flight and ground operations, and total system life cycle management.  The contractor must clearly demonstrate the capability to provide the technical expertise and manufacturing capacity required to develop, produce, and sustain this system; and the personnel with the appropriate technical and operational expertise to conduct flight operations and execute the RISTA mission in a Joint military operational environment. Please note: This research is for the purpose of obtaining information only.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this market research. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  No submission of data at this time will impact any firms participation in the future competition of a competitive contract if such an action is assessed as possible by the Government through its review of information obtained through this market research. 2.0       DESCRIPTION/REQUIREMENTS Specific project requirements include, but are not limited to:   	1)  Maintenance and logistics capability to provide a ninety percent operational availability rate of the aircraft and aircraft subsystems, to include Aircraft Survivability Equipment, based on OEM inspection and maintenance programs in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration rules and regulations.

<CONTACT>Marian E. Gordon Contract Specialist 3039692158     marian_gordon@nps.gov;
<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is conducting a sources sought for the work described below.  This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Marian Gordon at Marian_Gordon@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-6646 by close of business Tuesday, April 24, 2007. Project Description:  Work will include replacement of portions of concrete pavements and stairs, patch repair of spalls and delaminations at concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, replication or repair of concrete piers and decorative elements (urns, ballisters and other pre-formed objects), repair of concrete with imbedded elements, and repair of cracks in historic concrete.  NAICS 238110 Concrete Repair. Meridian Hill Park is located in Washington, D.C. approximately one and one-half miles north of the White House.  It is one of Washington's most important and historic parks in the tradition of the monumental, federal parks of the Mall. Bounded by 16th Street on the west, Euclid Street on the north, 15th Street on the east and W Street on the south, Meridian Hill Park is located within a diverse and changing neighborhood. Originally envisioned as "a classical villa landscape at the center of a vibrant and interesting residential neighborhood", the park continues to play an important role in the physical as well as social landscape of the neighborhood. Meridian Hill Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, as "an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th-century Neoclassicist park design in the United States" This significant historic resource was originally created to provide visitors and the citizens of Washington D.C. with a formal garden comparable to the public gardens of Paris, Rome and other foreign capital cities. Among its distinctive architectural features are walks, terraces, pools, fountains, and cascades that were constructed of exposed concrete aggregate, using the pioneering techniques developed by craftsman John Earley Despite being the object of several years of repair and restoration, a large amount of deteriorated exposed aggregate retaining walls, paving, and steps remains and deterioration of walls and paving continues. The National Park Service (NPS) seeks interest from experts in the concrete industry capable of providing expert advise, formula development services, and ongoing repair of the decorative concrete.   Formulas for the concrete mixes for repair have been developed, but the Park has varied concrete within and additional mixes and formulas may need to be developed.  There are slight variations in the same mix for the concrete in different locations; therefore, some adjustment must be made to create samples to match specific locations. Work will include replacement of portions of concrete pavements and stairs, patch repair of spalls (missing, damaged or deteriorated locations) and delaminations at concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, and replication or repair of concrete piers and decorative elements. Spalls are both shallow and deep, deep spalls being those which have exposed rebar within the spalled area and shallow spalls those with no visible reinforcing (prior to cleaning and preparation for repair). Some repairs may require injection grout and/or repair mortar.    Title of Project:  Repair and Maintenance of Historic Aggregate Concrete, Meridian Hill Park, Washington, DC Type of Procurement:  NPS is exploring the possibility of soliciting and awarding a multiple year IDIQ contract to satisfy this need and is trying to determine the contractor interest, availability, and expertise in this type of requirement.   Submit:  Please indicate your company's interest in the project by submitting a Company profile with "resume" of your company's experience specific to Historic Aggregate Concrete work.  Include references for related experiences.  The Park is open to the public daily.  Interested contractors are welcome to visit the site for closer inspection of the work required.    Due date to submit interest:  April 24, 2007

<DESC>The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida is seeking a sources sought notice from potential vendors for a possible purchase of a Video RF System in support of the 46 Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.  The sources sought announcement number is F1T0DE7074A999.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334310, with a small business size standard of 750. Please identify/confirm your business size in your response based upon this standard.  The 46th Range Support Squadron, Threats & Mobile Targets Flight has a need for a color video compression/recording system.  The system shall consist of a color video capture device, some type of digital compression/decompression, an RF link for video, fiber/Ethernet connectivity at the receiver, a video switching capability and capable of display on a computer monitor. This sources sought request is for non-developmental items that are available for delivery within a time period of 6-12 months.  This solution shall be used to assist in controlling mobile surface targets, land and sea.  The system is to be used when targets need to be controlled from a distance of ¼ to 30 miles.  The current system must be replaced due to the large bandwidth required for the uncompressed video signals.  Due to the relocation of the frequency bands, the bandwidth of allowable frequency is being reduced from 1715-1850 MHz to 176501850 MHz. The capabilities of the new system must be able to support at least eight unique locations with 12 being the most preferable objective within the 1765-1850 MHz bandwidth.  A JF12 certification is required as the new system will operate on multiple Department of Defense (DoD) ranges.  The camera requires a minimum 30 fps frame rate, to allow for real-time visual cues of the terrain, but higher frame rates for scoring purposes are desirable. The ability to configure each camera to adjust for environmental changes at the camera’s location is required, but it is preferred to have the capability to remotely configure each camera. The cameras are normally installed external to the target; therefore, environmental protection of IP64 or better is needed. A latency of less then 200ms is also required between the camera and the receiver 1/4 - 30 miles away. Up to four cameras are used on each target, so a solution having the capability of sending a minimum of two videos, and a maximum of four, over one link using multiple streams or picture-in-picture technology is required. It is highly desired that this system be capable of supporting low-light level cameras and feeds from night vision capable devices, including forward looking infrared systems. 
     Due to the destructive nature of the tests the system supports, an economical solution for the equipment to be installed on the surface target is preferred. That portion of the system that is on the target, and subject to loss, should not exceed a total cost of $5,000 per copy (in 2007 dollars) for all applications.  A video-switching capability at the vehicle control area with fiber connectivity is also
required to allow for the target video to be moved to different consoles as needed. The receiver system shall be portable and have fiber connectivity, as it will be installed on as-needed basis at facilities on the test site. The video shall be displayed on computer monitors, as the controller needs to be able to see the video as he controls the vehicle from outside the footprint.  Based on the information provided in response to this Sources Sought request, video instrumentation may be selected to undergo a government test program to assess quality. The responses to this Sources Sought request should include information on the above referenced statements, and comments about providing a single system solution within six months with approximately 7-10 units to follow in the FY08-FY10 time period. The response to this Sources Sought request should also include all costs to the Government for equipment and software that is required to support the Government's test that will be supplied by the contractor. The Government does not anticipate the need for on-site support by the contractor during testing. This Sources Sought request does not represent a contract, a promise to contract or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Air Force. All responses to this Sources Sought request must be received No Later Than (NLT) 4:00 P.M., Central Standard Time (CST) on 23 April 2007.  Send all source information to Mike DeNamur (Phone 850-882-0339), 205 West D Avenue, Suite 542, Eglin AFB FL, 32542-6864, or by facsimile to 850-882-1680, or by email at michael.denamur@eglin.af.mil.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience.  NARA supports lifecycle management of records for all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.

<SUBJECT>A -- Intrinsically Assurable Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (IAMANET)
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE – SN07-30
DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Conference in support of the Intrinsically Assurable Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (IAMANET) program on April 26, 2007 at the Hyatt Hotel, 1325 Wilson Blvd, Arlington VA 22209 from 0900 to 1700.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the planned IAMANET program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

DARPA expects to publish a Broad Agency Announcement and an Early-Career Investigator Research Announcement in the relatively near term with further details, and is scheduling the proposer day in advance as a way of providing potential proposers with notice at the earliest possible time. The technical and programmatic details described in this announcement are accordingly subject to change.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the IAMANET program is to develop an intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network. An intrinsically assurable mobile ad-hoc network will directly support integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, safety, and non-repudiation of MANET communications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited. Finally (although not exhaustively) existing protocols are not robust to byzantine failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure. The broad objectives of the IAMANET program are to address these Internet-paradigm problems and related challenges such as: increasing the probability that bad behavior will be detected; increasing work factor and uncertainty for an adversary; and explicitly identifying a minimal set of critical components that must be deeply evaluated and protected from lifecycle attacks. Specific program metrics will highlight attack containment and the prevention of information exfiltration.

Even though the program is initially focused on MANETs, substantial elements of the proposed solutions will be expected to have application in the wider Global Information Grid (GIG) and will be expected to address many of the design criteria of the original DARPA Internet (if not necessarily in the same priority order). The scope of the envisioned program extends to clean-slate designs. For discussion of the original DARPA Internet design criteria and their relationship to clean-slate approaches, potential proposers are encouraged to study the proceedings of the Assurable Global Networking (AGN) RFI workshop. The AGN proceedings, as well as emerging questions and answers, can be retrieved via the IAMANET web site at http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/IAMANET/index.html.

A MANET is a mobile multi-hop wireless communication network, possibly but not necessarily hierarchical in nature, and possibly but not necessarily directional in nature. MANET nodes generally contain both hosts and routers, and are deployed on heterogeneous platforms including manned and unmanned vehicular platforms in the ground and in the air, stationary and mobile sensor systems, and handheld devices. Some but not all MANET nodes are limited by resource constraints including power and processing capacity, which may affect their ability to participate fully or partially in a cooperative defense of the network. MANETs cannot rely on centralized services, are intended to be self-forming, have dynamic topology, cannot assume global visibility, and lack physical security. The wireless medium implies bandwidth limitations, intermittent connectivity, and message loss. MANETs will be forward-deployed and exposed, and as a result all mobile networking protocols and infrastructure are prone to attack and manipulation. In addition, the wireless communication channel provides easy passive analysis and potential for disruption from adversaries. Nonetheless, whether under attack or not, an assurable MANET will be expected to sustain a wide range of applications and traffic loads, to include unicast and multicast traffic patterns, elastic and inelastic traffic, client-server/peer-to-peer/group communications, plus semi-real-time traffic as well as traffic with softer delivery requirements.

 The IAMANET program threat model concerns cyberattack in the information domain, including computer worms, pre-inserted malicious code, remote cyber intrusions, exfiltration, protocol exploits, misconfiguration, infrastructure attacks, as well as halting and byzantine failures. Byzantine failures, in contrast to halting failures, involve unexpected and possibly malicious behavior, extending to collusion between multiple subverted system elements. To the extent that the proposed solution addresses vulnerabilities in the social, physical, or cognitive threat domains proposers should highlight these benefits.

The high-level IAMANET system model comprises network applications, a radio, the intrinsically assurable network infrastructure, a “secondary defensive subsystem,” and the interfaces or APIs (Application Programming Interface) between these elements. The network infrastructure provides basic networking functionality. The secondary defensive subsystem, if present, provides hidden detection, traceback, and quarantine of malicious activity and comprises techniques that require obscurity because they rely on surprise, statistical analysis, or invisible logical redundancy.

DARPA plans to solicit only Phase 1 of the IAMANET program at this point. In Phase 1, research and development will concern primarily the applications, the intrinsically assurable network infrastructure, and any necessary APIs but not the secondary defensive subsystem. Key security responses of the assurable network infrastructure are expected to involve authenticating and accounting for the use of all network resources, denying all but authorized traffic, and tolerating byzantine (other-than-fail-stop) failures from one or more network nodes and applications. Dynamic reconfiguration, re-provisioning, and reconstitution may also be responses of the network infrastructure.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: DARPA will host a web site for information about the IAMANET solicitation at http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/IAMANET/index.html.  Questions about the IAMANET solicitation should be directed to IAMANET-solicitation@darpa.mil with a cc to the program manager, Mr. J. Christopher Ramming, at mailto:James.Ramming@darpa.mil.

ELIGIBLE PROPOSERS: DARPA plans to release both a Broad Area Announcement (BAA) and a Research Announcement. Each has different proposer eligibility requirements, and certain security-related issues will affect proposers in either case.

DARPA has determined that it is in the national interest to support a new generation of researchers who will become deeply familiar with technical issues of strategic importance to the Department of Defense. Therefore, a Research Announcement (RA) will specifically target the community of “Early-Career Investigators.” For purposes of the RA, an “Early-Career Investigator” is defined to be a researcher who meets all of the following criteria:
•	Holds a tenure-track faculty position at a U.S. institution of higher learning;
•	Is not tenured as of the date this proposal will be due (estimated to be June 13, 2007);
•	Was awarded a PhD no earlier than January 1, 1998; and
•	Received a first appointment as faculty member no earlier than January 1, 1998.
Given this definition, the proposal teams that are eligible to apply to this RA comprise teams of grant institutions in which the principals meet the Early-Career Investigator definition.  The proposal team shall be in an organizational structure that allows for efficient communication with DARPA and performance of proposal team responsibilities.  It is recognized that the proposal team may utilize non-proposal team members as sub awardees for certain aspects of the proposed work.  However, a majority of the research effort and leadership of the technical direction must reside with the Early-Career Investigators.
Eligibility for the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is not restricted to Early-Career Investigators. With respect to the BAA, the Government encourages proposals from non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories. Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small or small disadvantaged business participation due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought. Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per P.L. 103-337 § 217 and P.L 105-261 § 3136. Any responsible and otherwise qualified U.S. Proposer is encouraged to respond. Participation by foreign institutions is not permitted. 

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR ELIGIBLE PROPOSERS (applicable to both BAA and RA): Please note that although Phase 1 of this program is currently planned to be unclassified, aspects of subsequent phases will be classified. Proposers to Phase 1 must intend to participate in subsequent phases, and will be expected to outline the means whereby they will be able to continue work in subsequent phases. This means, at a minimum, that the prime contractor/grantee in Phase 2 and beyond must be a U.S. based institution holding a current facility clearance. Proposers will be expected to describe the management plan and a division of labor that will permit the team to propose to subsequent program phases. The prime contractor or grantee will be expected to comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Laws, and other governing statutes that may become applicable.

Please note that these provisions do not preclude the possibility of university-based research in Phase 1.  Listed below are three non-exhaustive possibilities that potential university-based proposers could investigate.  
•	If a university wishes to do classified research for the first time, DARPA may, if it chooses, sponsor a facility clearance during Phase 1.
•	There are a number of university affiliated research centers with pre-existing facilities clearances that may act as primes for a consortium of uncleared researchers; the research center would need to appropriately safeguard classified information from the unclassified participants and could serve as a point of continuity across multiple phases.
•	Because Phase 2 will involve a new solicitation and a new contract, it is possible that a prime/subcontractor relationship in Phase 1 could be inverted in Phase 2 to provide continuity; the idea would be to get an integrator with facilities clearance involved during Phase 1 and transition responsibility for the project to that integrator in Phase 2.

CLASSIFICATION GUIDE OVERVIEW:  The high-level IAMANET system model comprises network applications, a radio, the intrinsically assurable network infrastructure, a “secondary defensive system,” and the interfaces or APIs (Application Programming Interface) between these elements. The secondary defensive system is expected to be classified, but Phase 1 does not require the design and implementation of that defensive system. Please note that although this overview represents DARPA’s current best view, classification guidance is a matter of national security and there is always a possibility that further analysis will result in modifications to this guidance. A draft security classification guide will be available to potential proposers at a later date.
	
REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than April 19, 2007, by following the registration link available at the IAMANET web site https://www.enstg.com/signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=INT79998 .  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to 150 registrants, with no more than 1 representative per organization unless space permits. The Proposers’ Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 “Foreign National Visit Request.”  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  Jackie Lynch, SRS, fax 703-741-0077, no later than April 19, 2007.  Both documents are available for download at the registration website.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated solicitation.

Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain four (4) charts and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers’ Day Conference should send a note to that effect to IAMANET-solicitation@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers’ Day Conference.  

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers’ Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.  The briefing will be subsequently posted to the IAMANET web site. An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be emailed to IAMANET-solicitation@darpa.mil for review by April 19, 2007.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16 and DFARS Change Notice (DCN) 2007-03-27.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3825 and the size standard is 500.  NAICS is 334515.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.
 
The 412th Test Wing at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB has a requirement to provide polyethylene radar absorbent material (RAM) for electromagnetic absorption in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF);
 NOTES: 
(1) Unless noted otherwise, all RAM dimensions below refer to nominal height, i.e.: 600 mm is close enough to 24 inches; 
(2) Unless noted otherwise, standard base dimensions required are 24 inch x 24 inch (600 mm x 600 mm may be acceptable);
(3) If your company does not currently produce the particular item requested, do not quote unless your company can deliver within 18 Weeks After Receipt of Order;
(4) Closed-cell polyethylene RAM is more durable than open-cell polyurethane. The Government will evaluate tradeoffs between performance, unit cost, past performance, and durability before making a final purchase decision. Quotes for any product containing uncharacterized RAM coating treatment WILL NOT be considered by the Government during the selection process.
 
This purchase will be for 2500 Each, 24 inch x 24 inch x 24 inch polyethylene radar absorbent material (RAM) with removable polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrol walkway caps; 600 Each, 24 inch x 24 inch x 18 inch polyethylene radar absorbent material (RAM) with removable polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrol walkway caps; and 400 Each, 24 inch x 24 inch x 18 inch polyethylene radar absorbent material (RAM) without removable walkway caps in accordance with the following Statement of Work and specifications: 
STATEMENT OF WORK FOR CLOSED CELL POLYETHYLENE MICROWAVE PYRAMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS WITH SOME WALKWAY CAPS;

1.0 SCOPE: The 772nd Test Squadron of Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement to provide electromagnetic energy absorption in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This capability requires the installation of radar absorbing material (RAM) in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  This RAM must be of a closed-cell design to minimize release of carbon or foam particles during routine handling.  The RAM must be of a durable material able to withstand years of handling operations and strong enough to support 300 pounds or more (with the installation of a removable walkway non-loaded cap).  This purchase of 24 inch x 24 inch x 24 inch pyramidal absorber with walkway RAM caps (quantity of 2500) and 24 inch x 24 inch x 18 inch pyramidal absorber (quantity of 600 with walkway RAM caps and quantity of 400 without walkway RAM caps) is needed to provide the necessary attenuation for the frequencies tested within the BAF;  

2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  1) IEEE Standard 1128 -- Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz.  2) NRL Report 8093;

3.0 REQUIREMENTS:

   3.1 Testing for Frequency Performance;

3.1.1 Reflectivity Attenuation Testing for RAM:  Frequency reflectivity measurements are required for each lot.  (A lot is defined as a manufacturing run for which there is no break in production, base materials are mixed from the same supplier's batches, and a mixture operation is not stopped/restarted.)  Each lot of RAM shall be uniquely numbered and representative samples tested.  The individual RAM pieces must be randomly selected for each lot sample test.  The frequency range required for this measurement is from 500 MHz to 18 GHz at normal incidence angle and will be required to meet or exceed the manufacturer's advertised specifications for the RAM being tested, or to meet or exceed the attenuation requirements in the table below, whichever is greater.  Test samples will be taken from lots throughout all manufacturing runs.  Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data shall be delivered for each lot of RAM tested, indicating which serially numbered pieces were tested.  A test lot sample size is defined by the quantity of RAM pieces required to populate the manufacturer?s reflectivity test fixture; 

Frequency Range	0.5 - 1.0 GHz	1.0 - 3.0 GHz	3.0 - 18.0 GHz
Minimum Attenuation	30 dB	40 dB	50 dB

3.1.2 Performance Degradation Testing of Walkway RAM Caps:  In addition to testing the RAM itself, the performance of the non-loaded (no carbon impregnation) walkway RAM caps must be fully characterized.  Using the same methods for testing the RAM without caps, frequency reflectivity measurements must be taken for RAM with walkway caps installed.  Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data shall be delivered, allowing for clear comparisons of RAM performance with and without walkway caps;

3.1.3 Data Delivery Requirements.  All data collected for frequency testing must be provided on or before date of RAM delivery.  The US Government will not accept any shipments of RAM and/or caps which are not provided with the required associated data upon date of RAM delivery.  Each measurement plot must identify by serial number which pieces were tested for that plot.  Additionally, a table must be provided to show which serial numbers belong to which lot.  Delivered data must include frequency-attenuation graphs;

   3.2 Manufacturing Constraints. 

3.2.1 Glue lines.  Due to the multi-use test nature of the BAF, glue lines are generally undesirable for high frequency BAF tests.  If any manufactured RAM will include any seams whatsoever, the seams must be characterized for possible performance degradation.  Appropriate data and graphs must be provided.  The seam lines are to be specified;  

3.2.2 Pyramid Design.  The RAM to be purchased for this SOW shall be of standard pyramid design with 9 pyramids per 24 inch x 24 inch x 24 inch RAM piece and 16 pyramids per 24 inch x 24 inch x 18 inch RAM piece;

3.2.3 Footprint Size Tolerance.  The BAF is marked with a 4 foot by 4 foot grid that has been permanently scored onto the entire concrete floor.  Since this RAM will be placed onto the BAF?s 4 foot x 4 foot gridded floor, it is highly desired that the RAM be sized to accurately fit this grid.  The RAM shall be manufactured to a 24 inch by 24 inch base with a maximum size tolerance of +0.0 inch/-0.38 inch;

3.2.4 Physical Integrity Requirement.  The RAM must not shed or leach carbon and fire retardants through an inherent closed-cell design.  All RAM to be purchased as part of this SOW must not shed carbon particles during normal handling -- including dropping an upright piece of RAM from a height of 3 feet onto a concrete surface (with the bottom RAM surface impacting the concrete);

   3.3 Delivery Constraints. 
RAM delivery must be coordinated with the 772nd Test Squadron Director of Operations.The last delivery of the entire order should not exceed 4 weeks from the first delivery;

   3.4 Fire Retardancy;
Independently test the flammability of the RAM?s manufacturing method to meet the fire retardancy required by NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  Additional fire retardancy standards may be used as well such as UL 94 HBF;

   3.5 Physical Characteristics for RAM;
The physical description of the 18 inch and 24 inch pyramidal RAM is provided in the table below:
Overall Height;	18 and 24 inches +/-0.5 inch;
Overall RAM Footprint, 24 inches square +0.0/-0.38 inch;
Pyramids per piece,9 per 24 inch pyramidal and 16 per 18 inch pyramidal;Pyramid Shape,Standard pyramid; Fire Retardancy (for RAM material and walkway caps),IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3); RAM Material,	Closed cell polyethylene; and
Color,	Black or Light Blue for the RAM and White for the walkway caps;

   3.6 Past Performance Requirements;
Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: a.RAM manufactured to similar specifications (SOW Para 3.5); b. Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3); c.	Ability to deliver a similar quantity of RAM within the time frame specified (SOW Para 3.3);

   3.7 Program Management;
The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor?s ability to meet and satisfy the performance or schedule requirements of this SOW;

Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the items described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete quote including delivery FOB destination Edwards AFB CA, 93524, within 18 Weeks After Receipt of Order.

<DESC>The outcomes to be satisfied are Base Operations Facility Support Contracting for the following specific services:  HVAC, Water, Sewer, Electrical, Building maintenance including minor construction, Fire Alarm and Elevator maintenance.  The outcomes are performance based. The Contractor’s performance will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  Past Performance, Management, Technical Approach/Methods, and Price.  The price evaluation will be approximately equal to the sum of the three technical performance criteria.  From a technical perspective, the criteria for evaluation will center on the offeror’s ability to perform contracts of this size and scope.  These services are currently being performed under the existing five year NOLA BOS contract, a small business set-aside with an annual FFP value of $2.7Million and IDIQ task orders averaging $2Million.  Historically, only in the last year have the IDIQ amounts exceeded $1Million.  And though this contract is not exceptionally complex or of a significant dollar value, because we are setting this aside for a HUBZone small business only, the Government is most interested in the offeror’s ability to manage multi-disciplines of non-technical specialties such as building maintenance and associated minor construction with technical specialties such as fire alarm and elevator maintenance.  Likewise utility management of water, wastewater, gas, steam,  electrical distribution systems and refuse collection and recycling requires a specialty knowledge beyond traditional building/facility maintenance.

The current and potential risks for this contract are no more than for a typical small BOS type contract.  The contract period will be for one year with two one-year options commencing with the start of each federal fiscal year.  Option periods are not guaranteed.

The Incumbent Contractor is Satellite Services, Inc., 309 S. Front St., Marquette, MI  49855. The Contract Number is N62467-01-D-6660. The Award Date was 01 Oct 2001. The Period of Performance Expires 30 Sep 2007.  The Total Estimated Value through five years of contract performance to include FFP and IDIQ was $20,984,434.90

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for a Vector Signal Analyzer per the following Specifications. PR4200192186 ¨C Vector Signal Analyzer This Purchase Request is for a Vector Signal Analyzer for the SCiP Compatibility Test Sets Project. The instrument will be a cornerstone instrument for use in the Glenn Compatibility Test Laboratory. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 1.1 - REQUIRED CAPABILITES The instrument shall include the following capabilities: 1.1.1 Minimum 40-MHz Capture/Analysis Bandwidth ¨C The Vector Signal Analyzers can be conceptualized as a tuned RF frequency converter followed by A/D converter. After the conversion, digital signal processing techniques are used to perform a myriad of measurements. One of the critical specifications for the instrument is the bandwidth of the A/D. This bandwidth determines the widest signal which can be analyzed / demodulated in near real time. The SCiP Project will require analysis bandwidths of up to 100-MHz. For the near term we require a minimum 40-MHz Capture/Analysis Bandwidth. The analyzer must be capable of 100-MHz bandwidth after upgrade. (Modifications within the same unit). 1.1.2 Signal Capture and Playback ¨C The vector signal analyzer ¡®captures¡¯ and stores a received signal into internal memory. The captured signal includes all of the noise, interference and spectral components. The captured signal can then be played back over and over while the instrument settings are changed to make different measurements. This capability is extremely useful for finding and analyzing transients. Once a transient is captured to memory, the operator may play it back to look at it in the frequency domain and measure center frequency, spectral mask, nearby noise. The signal can be played back again from memory but in zero-span mode to measure the transient¡¯s duration, rise / fall times, etc. 1.1.3 Capture a Waveform for later Playback on a compatible Vector Signal Generator ¨CFor this capability, the instrument is used as a demodulator and the actual symbols are recovered and recorded along with information about the modulation used. This information is transferred to a vector signal generator where a regenerated signal can be created for repeated playback. For example, the Vector Signal Analyzer could be set up to record a TDRSS compatible signal from an actual satellite passing overhead. Next the captured waveform is moved over to the Vector Signal Generator for later playback to other devices in the lab. This payback capability enables us to use captured signals from the real world in the lab. Most of the instruments researched include this capability. 1.1.4 Frequency Mask Trigger ¨C This capability allows the instrument to be triggered when a spectral component within a narrow frequency range, exceeds a user generated mask. With this feature, the instrument can trigger on a very small signal located spectrally close to or within a large signal. Most instruments only have a simple ¡®level trigger¡¯ which would trigger on the large signal. 1.2 ¨C MINIMUM PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS Input Frequency Range			10 KHz to 8-GHz 	 Input Signal Amplitude			+10 dBm to -145 dBm 					TOI to DANL (preamp off) Capture/Analysis Bandwidth		40-MHz min, field				  	       upgradeable to 100-MHz Smallest Resolution Bandwidth		¡Ü5-Hz Support the Following Modulations	PSK (BPSK, QPSK, S-				  	 QPSK) and 16-QAM Modulation Displays			Constellation, Vector	 					Diagram, EVM,Eye Diagram Modulation Measurements 		EVM, Magnitude Error,				        Phase Error, IQ Origin 					Offset RF Measurements 			Frequency Error, Channel  					Power, Adjacent Channel 					Power, Occupied  					Bandwidth 1.3 ¨C INSTRUMENT FEATURES/COMPATIBILITES The Instrument must support the following features and / or compatibilities: 1.	Compatibility with LabVIEW (LabVIEW drivers) for remote control of instrument. All front panel functions and controls must be accessible from within LabVIEW. 2.	Touch Screen Color Display, with provision for external mouse and keyboard. 3.	Include a spectrogram (frequency and amplitude vs. time display) 4.	Ability to display and save the demodulated symbols (Symbol Display / Symbol Table) 5.	External Trigger Input 6.	External Frequency Reference Input 7.	External Monitor Output (XGA resolution or better) 8.	Environment ¨C The instrument will be used in a common laboratory. It will be used on a bench or on a laboratory cart in the temperature controlled environment. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-14. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334516 and 500 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

The Decision Agent™ (DA), Communications Gateway System (CGS), Enhanced Communications Gateway System (ECGS), Mail Room (MR), LMDS, and Message Center are all Proprietary Software Products of NGSC/CMS. The development and support of these products require specific message handling expertise, expert teams of engineering talent, access to the source codes, and an extensive system of product configuration and testing capabilities. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the Technology Refresh of the Departments Alternate Communications Site (ACS) Decision Agent (DA) Computer System. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products and services of another company. The Department has been advised that Northrop Grumman has not certified its proprietary software to run on and be compatible with any other vender’s hardware.   Northrop Grumman’s Decision Agent (DA) software products are tested, certified, and implemented on the IBM X-Series and incorporates its Mail Room and Enhanced Communications Gateway System (ECGS), is used by the Department to provide an alternate command and control messaging capability in the event of a national emergency when the Department’s primary systems would be inoperable. The system has been certified and accredited. Currently all message traffic is backed up to the site, and in the event of an emergency it would allow the principle officers within the Department, and other connected agencies to communicate via secure direct and dial up connections to send and receive official messages. The system is a critical component of the Department’s Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) planning. The project was approved, and funds provided by the Department’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Steering Committee.  This alternate communications capability is vital to the continued accomplishment of mission essential business and support of diplomatic activities worldwide in the event of a catastrophic loss of communications capability at Main State (HST) or the Beltsville Information Management Center (BIMC). The ACS provides assurance that there will be a wide range of survivable communications maintained with Embassies and Consulates around the world. The Alternate Communications Site (ACS) concept addresses the single point of failure and disaster recovery issues that were found to be inadequately supported and provides the Department of State with reasonable and cost effective survivable communications necessary to maintain the Diplomatic Command and Control communications and the interoperability of the Foreign Affairs Community.<BR><BR>The ACS as part of the Global Telecommunications Network has established a survivable telegraphic command & control communications capability with alternate routing provided  by dial-up and leased communications circuitry for more than sixty agencies. IRM requires the Technology Refresh of Northrop Grumman’s Decision Agent (DA), Mail Room, Hardware, and Enhanced Communications Gateway System software products, and includes renewal of the Software Subscription Service Agreement on a brand name only basis.  The software products being supported are proprietary to Northrop Grumman, which has not licensed the software, annual maintenance, or training to any other entity. As this is a brand name only justification, the hardware products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements for a commercially available product for command and control messaging. No other commercially available products are available that could meet the Department’s requirements. The Department intends that DA, Mail Room, and ECGS software will continue to be installed on IBM hardware and operational for at least three years into the future The Department cannot afford to replace the existing products with another vendor’s non-tested / non-certified hardware products.  This Brand Name Hardware procurement will ensure that support for the Northrop Grumman software is renewed for the next three years and is significant in terms of critical infrastructure protection and emergency preparedness.   The nature of this Technology Refresh procurement prevents the Department from considering, at this time, any hardware other than the Northrop Grumman recommended IBM X-Series Servers for which their software products have undergone extensive tests and assessment, evaluation for security testing, and received final Certification and Accreditation. The Information Resource Management, Beltsville Messaging Center, Alternate Communications Site Manager request this requisition be processed as soon as possible.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Amendment #3 is hereby issued to the above cited synopsis/solicitation reference number 750200000509 to provide the following 8 questions and answers. All other terms and conditions will remain the same.

1. Because there will be multiple deliveries do you have a central location on site for each of the deliveries to be stored until everything arrives and the installation can be set up? If you went with shipping to the installers and they bring it out when all has arrived then there is storage fees to be considered that the installer would charge and would be variable depending on the length of the storage (this is very hard to deal with on a quote). If there is a location to receive the deliveries and store them then do you have the personnel to offload the trucks or do you need the installers to come out each time a delivery arrives to offload it. If you do this is very expensive in that you are in excess having many install appointments. 

No storage holding facility available.  Installers would need to offload the truck and setup.
 
2. Are all of these items being shipped to 1 building, because if there is multiple buildings there would need to be multiple installations depending on what the conditions of the installers have at each location. 

One building – two floors.
 
3. Conditions - for an accurate installation quote you will need to tell us if there is a dock at the location or will a lift gate be required on the delivering truck. Also if the building that is being delivered to has more than 1 floor then they will need to know if there is an elevator available. If not they will need to know how many flights of stairs are involved and the count of how many steps to a flight. Any time there is any steps they need to know how many. 

No loading dock at building, so a lift gate will be required on the delivering truck.  Deliveries will need to be made to first and second floors. Inside elevator in building. 

4. Is there a loading dock?  If anything is being placed above ground floor, is there an elevator? 

ATF does not have a loading dock, but we have an inside elevator. 
Furniture will go on both the first and second floors.

5. For line items 1 through 6 are the tops of the worksurfaces/desks laminate or wood.  This product offers either laminate top or wood top. 

All the Inwood desks will be veneer/wood tops and Hon desks will be laminated.

6. What is the part number for line item 45 because provided is discontinued? The product number for Item 45 no longer exists (and the table has been discontinued.)  

ATF would like a similar product with the approximately the same specifications, must provide product literature and specification. 45) Coffee Table Queen Ann, Wood Color Cherry Finish, Dimensions 45”w x 27”d x 16”h  

7. What is the part number for line item 44? 

Chair is CH-3190 as described in the original combined synopsis/solicitation.

8. There is a discrepancy between product numbers an description on line items 26 & 27. Please, advise as to which is wanted. 

The three parts listed in items 25, 26 and 27 make up one Inwood Corner Unit Desk.

<DESC>Amendment 2 - December 8, 2006 ? Combined/Synopsis; Solicitation
              No. AG-43ZP-S-07-0006

Subject:  Question and Answers

The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received after the posting of the solicitation.  The solicitation closing date remains unchanged.  All proposal packages are due no later than 2:00 p.m. est. December 15, 2006.

Question 1:  There are 5 categories (A - E) of architectural/engineering services listed in the solicitation, are you awarding 1 contract per specific service type? 

Answer 1: Yes.  The government anticipates awarding a contract for each of the specific service type

Question 2: Are firms able to proposal on specific service types or do they need to offer all service types listed? 

Answer 2:  An offeror may offer for the categories in which their firms are qualified/interested in.  An offorer does not have to have offer for all categories.

Question 3: Since there are up to 5 contracts being awarded, will the selection committee consider capable small businesses to fill 1 or more of the contracts?

Answer 3:  Yes.  Small business will be considered for any of the 5 categories. However, the procurement is through full and open competition.

Question 4:  I wanted to confirm however if separate contracts are going to be issued for each of the A/E services categories noted.
 
A. Arch. Services, with Engineering Support for Arch. Projects
B. Engineering Services, M/E/P
C. Engineering Services, Struct., Geotech.
D. Landscape Architecture Services, with Civil Engr. Support In-House
E. Engr. Services - Civil, Env., Hazmat
 
Answer 4:  The government anticipates awarding 5 separate contracts.  The government would like for any firm that proposes to do so in the category in which it is best suited.  The government will consider separate proposals from the same firm for more than one category however, awarding five separate contracts is the government?s intent.

Question 5:  What are the limits on the contract for capacity per year and total contract?

Answer 5:  There are none, other than the size of any given task order, $1/2 million

Question 6:  Is it intended that one submittal/contract cover all 5 service areas, or should firms submit on each service area separately?

Answer 6:  Submit on each separately.

Question 7:  What US Forest Service computers/systems do we have to be compatible with?

Answer 7:  This is an evaluation criteria.  Minimum:  MS Windows, Word, Excel, AutoCad 2006;  Prefer in addition:  SpecLink, REVIT, Right N, Right Suite, eQuest 

Question 8:  Are you asking for 24 hour emergency response field capability under the "Environmental" or "HAZMAT" category?

Answer 8:  No

Question 9:  Is the cover letter included in the 100 pages?

Answer 9:  Yes

Question 10:  Is the QA Plan included in the 100-page limit?

Answer 10:  Yes

Question 11:  Do I understand that a separate Part 1 is to be submitted for each subconsultant or can we blend their quals (projects and resumes,in particular) into our Part 1? If submitted separately, do they count toward the 100 pages?

Answer 11:  Separate Part 1 for each subconsultant, but total of 100 pages per team

Question 12:  Do the "innovative forms and patterns in building design" count in the 100-page limit?

Answer 12:  Yes

Question 13:  What do you mean by "innovative forms"?

Answer 13:   This phrase refers to particularly notable past work done by the offeror, most typically to be illustrated by photographs and/or renderings.  

Question 14:  Do our subcontractors need to register their Reps and Certs online through the CCR also?

Answer 14:  Please refer to the following and see the last statement:

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registratiCR website at www.ccr.gov.

The FAR requires that prospective contractors complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with their required registration in the CCR database.  These Annual Representations and Certifications are submitted via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), a part of the Business Process Network (BPN).  To register in ORCA, you need to have an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record, a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN and your CCR records, and know your DUNS number.  Detailed information regarding ORCA and how to submit records is available on the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help and FAQs.  

Any award that is made, the prime contractor will have to be registered in CCR and ORCA.  It is not required for the subcontractors, however, it is highly recommended

 Question 15:   In regard to the Combine Solicitation posted 11/9/06, it is specified that
  you seek landscape architectural services with Civil Engineering Support
  In-house for this RFQ. We are a small landscape architectural firm without
  in-house civil engineering support. Can we qualify by teaming up with a
  Civil Engineering firm that has registered to receive notification?

Answer 15:  The government will consider proposal for landscape architectural with civil engineering support not in house with a teaming arrangement with a qualified civil engineering firm.  
Question 16:  The statement below implies this solicitation for A/E Services is only open to firms within 60 Miles of Atlanta, Georgia.  Is this truly the case?
 ?f.      Location of firm and subcontractors or consultants within the 60 mile radius of Atlanta, Georgia.?
Answer 16:  The statement is an evaluation factor, and does not mean that a firm will be eliminated from considered if they are outside of the 60 mile radius.

Question 17:  Can a firm propose on only one of the categories of services, or does the response need to address all of the potential services and the categories are only an internal reference?  For example, Engineering Services, Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing can be done by my firm in-house, can we just propose for this category?
 
Answer 17:   Yes a firm may propose on only one category, on more than one, or on all depending upon their qualifications as relates to each category.  See answer to question 4 above.

Question 18:    I noticed a firm location is mentioned regarding a 60-mile radius from Atlanta, GA.  Does the prime need to be located within that geographical boundary for consideration?
Answer 18:  See answer 16 above.
Question 19:   The RFQ says that this procurement will be unrestricted and is open to all businesses regardless of size, but then goes on to say that the NAICS code is 541310 (Architectural Services code) with a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts.  Our firm has average annual receipts of around $30 million, so are we eligible for this solicitation based on our average annual receipts?

Answer 19:  The RFQ is unrestricted; it is open to all qualified/interested offeror regardless of size and annual receipts.  Offerors having annual receipts greater than the size standard associated with the NAICS code 541310 may submit their qualifications.

Question 20:  On page 2 of this RFQ, the A-E services being sought under this announcement are listed.  We can fulfill all services except for the geotechnical engineering and hazmat engineering services, which we could provide with sub-consultants, but we would prefer not to have sub-consultants if at all possible so that we are not subject to MBE/WBE/DBE requirements.  Is it possible to submit our qualifications for the services we have available and still be considered for the contract, or do we need to fulfill all of the desired services as listed in the RFQ?

Answer 20:  Yes.  An offeror may submit for only one of the five categories or for all five depending upon qualifications.

Question 21:  If I understand the RFQ correctly, all information that we would like to submit in response to this RFQ must be contained in our SF-330 with a maximum of 100 single sided pages and we are not allowed to submit other materials about our firm.  Please confirm that this is correct.
Answer 21:  The page limitation for submittal of the SF 330 is 100 single sided.

The criteria for A-E evaluation consist of the following:



a.  Professional Qualifications:   Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance as demonstrated by education, experience, registration and management ability of personnel assigned to this contract and any applicable outside consultant.   Availability of experienced key personnel, professional discipline, and consultants and the number of years with the firm.  Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members.  If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment.  The following shall be submitted with the SF-330; (1) quality control plan, (2) awards and/or samples of innovative forms and patterns in building design.

c.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, construction inspection/surveillance and compliance with performance schedules. Telephone interviews with the references listed on the SF-330 and references obtained using the central database will be the means of obtaining past performance data.


d. Integrated Design:   Describe how the firm or firms team together to optimize the overall performance of a project, as opposed to one particular discipline (the prime) driving the design and then passing their work on to the next trade (the sub) for incorporation of their work with the prime designer?s work.  (For example, in the case of an architecture proposal, describe how your firm uses energy modeling to help drive decisions about the building envelope prior to development of a typical building section.)  Also include how the firm assures coordination and integration of the final product so that each trade?s work does not conflict with that of another; that drawings and specifications are project specific, having details and notes that do not apply to a particular project not included in the contract documents, and that the final product appears to be one seamless, coordinated package.

  
e.  Computer system compatibility:   Compatibility of proponent?s computer system with USDA Forest Service system.

  
f.  Location of firm and subcontractors or consultants within the 60 mile radius of Atlanta, Georgia. 


g.  Professional Capacity to accomplish the work within contract schedules considering timeliness of contract completion of services and delays.  Discuss how surge workload will be managed.  Evaluation will also include quality control program, innovative forms and patterns in building design.



All information relating to the firms qualification must be contained in the SF-330.  Inclusion by reference to other materials is not acceptable. All interested large business firms are reminded that the successful firm will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan.  The SF-330 is limited to 100 single-sided typed pages including information concerning the firms qualifications related to this specific contract.  Minimum font size is 10.

MEMORANDUM FOR 37 CONS/LGCB
FROM:  37 AMDS/CCA
SUBJECT:  New Balance Shoes Brand Name Justification
1.  AFMOA recommends the New Balance shoes for the DoD Foot Study. The shoes to be acquired are New Balance brand part numbers only M882, W882, M817, W817.
2.  The New Balance shoes are designed to work with the Fitracks foot scanners equipped with New Balance software which will prescribe the exact foot type and shoe type for the basic trainees participating in the Air Force approved study (Physical Training Footwear and Musculoskeletal Injuries, FWH-20070088H).
3.  Without the prompt delivery and setup of these shoes and this equipment, the Air Force will not be able to execute its responsibility to participate, collect data, determine a recommendation and publish data in the DoD-wide study.  Additional harms to the government are the delay in delivery of proper footwear to the trainees required to run mandated distances, a higher than necessary rate of lower leg injury to the trainees, delayed graduation dates and reduced retention of trainees in the AF, resulting in losses of thousands of previously invested recruiting dollars. 
4.  New Balance shoes are the brand currently being issued to the basic military trainees.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1

Question 1.  I would like to clarify if you PREFER or  REQUIRE all translators have previous successful experience, for each proposed translator, in translating from French into English WTO accession procedures documents prepared by the governments of Algeria, Tunisia or Morocco.  We work with very experienced translators who translate French into English-but may not have SPECIFIC experience on WTO documents prepared by the governments of Algeria, Tunisia or Morocco.

ANSWER.  It would be REQUIRE.  The language of the WTO is very technical. 

Question 2. I would like to confirm that you are NOT requiring any translation samples for this bid?

ANSWER.  Correct - no translation samples required.

Question 3. I would like to confirm you are requesting all bidders to quote ONE price for translation, editing and typesetting. (...fully loaded rates, per word, shall include all direct and indirect costs associated with the work requested in this SOW)

ANSWER.  Correct - ONE price.

Question 4. I would like to confirm that you  prefer, but not require, that all translators be native English speakers.

ANSWER.  Correct - preferred but not required.

Question 5.  Are there any incumbents?
ANSWER.  Lawtank GMBH (SA130104SE0104)

Question 6. Where is the work to be performed?
ANSWER.  The work could be worldwide since most of the translation to be accomplished will be emailed to the contractor.

Question 7.   The RFQ states that in the scope of work there is an “estimate that there will be 450-750 pages, 250 words per page, of documents to be translated” My question is this. Are these documents that total between 450 and 750 be given to the contractor at once, and then must be delivered in two weeks or will these documents be spread out over the entire year?
ANSWER.  The documents will be spread out over the year but the contractor should have the capability to complete at least 100,000 words per month

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW)
2007 Commercial Service Assessment


The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)/Career Development and Assignments Staff (CDAS) has an immediate requirement to procure a location to host and provide accommodations for the 2007 administration of the Commercial Service Assessment exam.  The dates for the exam are July 23, 2007 through August 4, 2007.  

Section 1: Background

The mission of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), International Trade Administration (ITA) is to promote trade and strengthen the international trade and investment position of the United States.  The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS) “Commercial Service” is one of four programmatic units within the International Trade Administration.  The mission of the Service is to promote United States exports, particularly those of small and medium-sized enterprises, and protect U.S. commercial interests abroad.  US&FCS is a corps of more than 1,800 American and foreign employees dedicated to helping American companies expand sales in overseas markets through an integrated network.  We operate more than 100 Export Assistance Centers throughout the United States and 150 offices worldwide.  

CDAS typically conducts the Assessment exam every two years to maintain staffing level within the Foreign Commercial Service.  This exam is of vital importance to the mission to the Commercial Service.  It is through this process that prospective new Foreign Service Officers are screened and selected.  The success or failure of the Commercial Service Assessment as a screening and selection device affects the quality of the overall human resource of the Commercial Service well into the future.  Traditionally, the Commercial Service used hotels as they provided both lodging and testing rooms in one facility.  Sleeping rooms converted to testing rooms by removing the furniture and adding a table and chairs, provide the appropriate size and privacy for individual interviews.

Section 2: Justification

Projects under this statement of work will contribute to Commercial Service workforce development and productivity by providing a facility to assess candidates at the FP-04/05 Class level (GS-12 and 11 grade equivalent respectively).  The 2007 Commercial Service Assessment will target a worldwide population (i.e., Commercial Service or other Federal GS-employees and candidates from the private sector).  Successful candidates will be eligible to receive job offers as Foreign Service Officers with the Commercial Service.

The Commercial Service has specific requirements for the facility we select.  One major consideration is the location of the Assessment testing rooms.  It is imperative that all testing rooms are located along the same corridor, on the same floor of the facility.  These reasons include:

2.1.1	Test Security - To ensure only those authorized have access to test materials.
2.1.2   Candidate Movement - To facilitate a seamless process for the candidates.
2.1.3   Staff Reduction - To reduce additional staff needed to monitor candidates.

Section 3: Scope of the Work

The facility shall provide services in three (3) main areas:

3.0.1	Seventeen (17) lodging rooms for the assessors, assessment facilitator and 
CDAS staff.  
3.0.2    Twelve (12) testing rooms for candidate assessment all on the same floor 
 and corridor.
3.0.3    One (1) large meeting room for assessor training.  

Section 3.1:  Components of the Project

Specific requirements to support this project shall include: 

3.1.1	Seventeen (17) lodging rooms for assessors, the assessment facilitator and staff – dates needed July 23-August 4, 2007

3.1.3	One (1) Assessor break room (approximately 20 people)
3.1.4	Two (2) Group break rooms for candidate (approximately 12-15 people)
3.1.5	Two (2) Computer rooms – Three (3) computers each room four (4) people
3.1.6	Six (6) testing rooms – Advocacy/Interview three (3) people
3.1.7	One (1) Control room – Testing material, and 
3.1.8	Assessor training room (approximately 25-30 people) – dates needed July 24-26, 2007

Section 3.2:	Additional Requirements for this Procurement Shall Include

3.2.1	Close proximity to a metro station to facilitate ease of movement between 
the facility, Commerce headquarters and area airports (preferably Washington, DC or Northern Virginia)
3.2.2	Availability of a business center for last minute reproduction
3.2.3	Eight (8) laptop computers six (6) for candidate testing with Microsoft Word, One (1) for assessor break room with Internet access and one for the Control room with Internet access).  CDAS will provide the laptops if the facility cannot
3.2.4	Availability of audio-visual equipment for assessor training
3.2.5	lose proximity to amenities for assessors who will work approximately 10-12 hour days for two weeks
3.2.6	Testing, training and lodging rooms in one facility to minimize transportation difficulties
3.2.7	Availability of transportation for candidates who participate in the assessment

Section 4:  Contract Type

not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
  (b) "Submission of offers." Submit signed and dated offers to
the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact
time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on

evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant
contracts for the same or similar items and other

and
    (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a
statement specifying the extent of agreement with all
terms, conditions, and provisions included in the
solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required
representations or information, or reject the terms and
conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from
consideration.
  (c) "Period for acceptance of offers." The offeror agrees to
hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the
date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period
is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) "Product samples." When required by the solicitation,
product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time
specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in
this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense
to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and
expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) "Multiple offers." Offerors are encouraged to submit
multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or
commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this
solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) "Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals
of offers."
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any
modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach
the Government office designated in the solicitation by
the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is
specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government
office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)
      (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an
offer received at the Government office designated in
the solicitation after the exact time specified for
receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered
unless it is received before award is made, the
Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late
offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce
method authorized by the solicitation, it was
received at the initial point of entry to the
Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m.
one working day prior to the date specified for
receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was
received at the Government installation designated
for receipt of offers and was under the Government's
control prior to the time set for receipt of offers;
or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it
was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise
successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable
to the Government, will be considered at any time it
is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at
the Government installation includes the time/date stamp
of that installation on the offer wrapper, other
documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the
installation, or oral testimony or statements of
Government personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal
Government processes so that offers cannot be received at
the Government office designated for receipt of offers by
the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent
Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the
closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers
will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day
specified in the solicitation on the first work day on
which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any
time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral
offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn
orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers,
offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time
before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject
to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning
facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by
an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the
exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the
person requesting withdrawal is established and the person
signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) "Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids)."
The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract
without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's
initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price
and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the
right to conduct discussions if later determined by the
Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject
any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept
other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
  (h)" Multiple awards." The Government may accept any item or
group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the
offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the
Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than
those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an
award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered,
at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies
otherwise in the offer.

solicitation."

<DESC>This is Amendment 01 to solicitation W91WAW-07-T-0066.  The purpose of this amendment is to change the delivery site of one of the machines from Iraq to Rosslyn, VA and answer questions received regarding subject solicitation.  As a result of the cha nge in delivery sites, the line item structure is hereby changed as follows:  CLIN 0001, 1 Each, High-volume Scanner, (Description), Delivery will be made to LAAWS Project Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 1200, Arlington, VA  22203-1837; CLIN 0002, 6 Each, High-volume Scanners, (Description), Delivery will be made to Office of the Judge Advocate General, 1777 North Kent Street, 10th Floor, Rosslyn, VA 22209-2194;  CLIN 0003, 1 Each, High-volume Scanner, (Description), Delivery will be made to US Army Claims Service, Bldg 4411, Llewellyn Ave., Fort Meade, MD 20755-5360;  CLIN 0004, 1 Each, High-volume Scanner, (Description), Delivery will be made to Headquarters, Third Army, Bldg 363, 1881 Hardee Ave. SW, Fort McPherson, GA 30330; CLIN 0005, 1 Each, High-volume Scanner, (Description), Delivery will be made to Office of the Judge Advocate, Bldg 2574, Yongsan, U.S. Army Garrison, Seoul, Korea 140-766.   Questions and answers are as follows: Q1: This solicitation is identified to the 423430 NAICS.  Are we correct in our assumption that since this is a Government procurement of supplies, the size standard is 500 as long as the offeror is small business? A1: Yes. Q2: Is this all or none bid? A2: Yes. Q3: Can we bid for US locations only? A3: No. Q4: If we bid for the overseas locations, do you provide US point of shipment and from there it is transported by your people to overseas locations?   A4: No.  The requirement is that the contractor is responsible for delivery from door to door Q5: What does APO stand for?   A5:  Army Post Office.  No longer relevant (see 7Q below).   Q6: Does the statement: 'on-site warranty; free drop ship delivery to US destinations and APOs, and drop ship delivery to overseas destinations' mean that the seller will be responsible for delivering to, installing, and maintaining the equipment while it is in Seoul Korea and Iraq? A6: The requirement is that there is a warranty with perhaps on-site repairs for US locations and free return service for warranty work from overseas or US locations if on-site repair not provided.  Yes  seller will be responsible for delivering to; no - installing, and maintaining the equipment while it is in Seoul Korea and Iraq. Q7: Will all of the deliveries overseas be addressed to APOs who will then send them overseas? A7: No.  APO addresses are only for communication and points of contact purposes only.  Given the weight of the scanners, shipping by APO may not be allowed per postal regulations. Q8: How does the customer intend to ship the scanners overseas?  Please clarify the shipping instructions. A8: Customer does not intend to ship the scanners overseas; the customer intends for the contractor to ship.  Shipping instructions are:  contractor causes to be delivered, by whatever means necessary for the product to arrive undamaged, fully assembled, a nd fully operational to the location designated within 30 days of contract award. Q9: Is the 300 ppm requirement correct? A9: No.  Correct requirement should be minimum 100 ppm (simplex) / 200 ipm (duplex).
