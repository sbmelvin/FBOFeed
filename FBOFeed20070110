<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals for the National Guidelines and Quality Measures Clearinghouses from offerors who have the capability to migrate, operate, maintain, enhance, and evaluate two existing yet related AHRQ Internet repositories of evidence-based information and associated companion materials These are: the National Guideline Clearinghouse (TM) (NGC), www.guideline.gov, for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines; and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse(TM) (NQMC), www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov, for evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. These Web resources have a database-backend, are indexed and searchable, and adhere to Health on the Net (HON) code ethics. Relationships between the two databases and Web sites that have already been established will be maintained. For this solicitation, each repository will retain its unique URL and name.

Content in NGC and NQMC is presented in a standardized format using a template of attributes specific to each Clearinghouse. This format permits side-by-side comparison of database content online. All guidelines in NGC and all quality measures in NQMC meet specific inclusion criteria. NGC has two additional content items: syntheses and Annotated Bibliographies. NQMC has browse features not available in NGC.  NGC has search features not available in NQMC. This requirement is content driven supported by information technology.  While there are information technology components in the requirement, it is not IT driven. Content on both the NGC and NQMC must be evaluated against evidence-based practice standards separate and apart from IT standards.

The goal of these two Clearinghouses is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, health care providers, health plans, integrated delivery systems, purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective, detailed information on clinical practice guidelines and quality measures and to further their dissemination, implementation and use in order to inform health care decisions.

This requirement will develop, deploy and maintain the processes and systems to collect, abstract, index, publish, update and archive clinical practice guidelines and quality measures. Implementation or evaluation tools associated with the submitted guidelines or measures will be identified and shared as potential content with AHRQ?s QualityTools Contractor. The guidelines and measures will be evaluated, extracted, entered and stored in a database; they will be posted to the existing Web sites. 

Early in this requirement?s life cycle, the Contractor will make recommendations to AHRQ on enhancements to each Web site (content, functionality, design), and following a systems development life cycle and configuration management plan, conduct usability tests, and through an iterative process refine the enhancements, test, eventually deploy, operate, maintain and assess customer satisfaction. 

Related content tasks include establishing a single expert panel and a single editorial board with capacity to offer guidance to both projects, propose revisions to the established content inclusion criteria and templates of attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouses on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of revisions to the inclusion criteria and standardized template. 

The Editorial Board will work with the content teams in key aspects of content development and production, such as, but not limited to, reviewing submissions against the inclusion criteria and judging how new or emerging knowledge in the clinical practice guideline and quality measurement fields could be acted upon.  The Editorial Board will also serve to assist in the development of recommendations on what information to seek from submitters in an online submission form (not currently available) and on how to enhance the user?s experience with the content currently posted, fill content gaps, and manage posting of user comments to the Web site, including responses from relevant guideline or measure developer organizations much like that done for scientific journals. 

The Web sites shall continue to be user-centered and meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department of Health and Human Services -wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using the approved domains, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records and documentation. 

Proposals must  demonstrate expertise in developing, appraising, implementing and using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; developing or evaluating and integrating informatics in efforts related to health services research, clinical practice guidelines or quality measures; expertise in indexing using the National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language System; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, managing and working with expert panels and editorial boards. In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content driven projects under tight timelines.  

Proposals must demonstrate personnel are seasoned professionals with education and proven experience with successful results in areas such as development, implementation, use, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; development of clinically related classifications schemes and use of National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language system; working with developers of clinical practice guidelines and quality measure, as well as, clinical organizations, including but not limited to hospitals, health plans, and medical specialty societies; completing highly technical and complex projects; migrating and constructing large relational databases; migrating and developing user-friendly Government Web sites. A  PMI?certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide EVM information.  
 
It is anticipated that the procurement will be on a cost reimbursable basis for a six-year period of performance (three year base with one three-year option).  For information purposes, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 516110 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting (500 people).  The successful offeror will comply with the DHHS/ AHRQ small business subcontracting goals set forth in the Request for Proposal.

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at www.ahrq.gov   Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about January 26, 2007 with proposals due April 24, 2007.

<CONTACT>Bernadine Stokes bernadine.stokes@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Hanscom AFB intends to award a sole source contract to Thermo Electron North America LLC, West Palm Bach, FL, under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), titled, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." This serves as a "Notice of Intent" to issue a purchase order under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13), to Thermo Electron North America on a Sole Source basis to purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer MAGNA 760 upgrade.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Fac 2005-14, Effective 22 Nov 2006.  The Government intends to award a contract for the following line items: (0001)  Standard OMNIC 7 software upgrade (0002)  Driver and Help for OMNIC upgrade (0003)  MAGNA 760 Beamsplitter Si (0004)  Polyethylene Window NEX Detector  (0005)  PCB MAGNA ANTR PCI Interface FOB: DESTINATION.  Inspection and Acceptance: DESTINATION. To maintain consistency and reduce risk to existing program requirements, this requirement is determined to be available from only one source because of the unique features and proprietary nature of the system manufactured explicitly for this particular FTIR from Thermo Electron North America LLC.  The requirement is needed to upgrade software/hardware for use of the existing (FTIR) Spectrometer making it compatible with Windows XP.  It is used to perform fundamental research on optoelectric devices and will require measurements of new wavelengths designed to operate the system with greater capability on Windows-based computers. The original hardware and software license software is a proprietary source code from Thermo Electron Corporation.  No formal requests will be issued for this procurement. All potential offerors should contact the buyer: Bernadine Stokes at (781)377-8693 or by email at bernadine.stokes@hanscom.af.mil for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  Responses must be received by 16 January 2007 at 8:00am.

<SUBJECT>16--Improved Brake System Program for the T-38C Aircraft
<SOLNBR>FA8617-07-R-6171
<RESPDATE>020907
<ARCHDATE>03312008
<CONTACT>Trinidad F. Rendon II, (937) 904-4304
<DESC>1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot School’s 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a “most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8 ½ x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.	Describe your present technical capability and past aircraft-specific history of meeting similar requirements. 2.	Describe in some detail your company’s proposed approach for meeting  this requirement. 3.	Identify any commercial item solutions that your company will  incorporate into proposed design. 4.	Identify any non-developmental solutions currently used on military aircraft that your company will incorporate into proposed design. 5.	Describe what portion of the proposed work will be accomplished  in-house versus subcontracting. 6.	Describe the technical risk and problem areas for this requirement, including any anticipated interfaces/technical inputs required to  implement a (system) solution. 7.	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline (proposed schedule) of major milestones. 8.	Describe proposed support approach 9.	State the size of your business and indicate whether you are a small business.

Section K?(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.  All Offerors must acknowledgment all amendments if any.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Specification, Past Performance, and price.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery. The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under RCRA, CERCLA, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  A relatively small number of sites may require remediation of radiological or ordnance waste, unexploded ordnance, and or munitions and explosives of concern (MEC).  The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.

It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California.

The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000. each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $100,000,000.  Fair opportunity will be provided for all resulting task orders in accordance with FAR 16.505(b).  

A pre-proposal site visit/meeting will be held on Tuesday, 13 February 2007 at 10:00 AM at 1205 Mill Road, Suite #2, Building 850, Naval Base Ventura County, Port Hueneme, California, 93403-4442 for the proposed Task Order 0001 project.

Due to space limitations, participation is limited to two (2) representatives from each firm.

Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 5 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 5.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with Sections L, and M of the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA), for  the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), NIH, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to FEI Company, 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, OR., 97124.  

The items to be purchase are: Item (1) Product # FP 5480/35- Inspect3D 
The package is required to provide a user-friendly solution for alignment of a tomographic series of images, 3D reconstruction of the data, as well as basic visualization functionality. The Inspect3D shall involve an x-y alignment, which can be based on either bead tracking or image cross-correlations.  These cross-correlations can be improved by a multitude of filter options.  Fine-tuning of the tilt axis position can be carried out interactively. Bead tracking traces multiple round particles on the specimen throughout the tilt series.  Apart from x-y alignment, bead tracking can also correct rotation and magnification changes for each image.  The reconstruction of the tilt series into a 3D volume of arbitrary size shall be carried out by three different algorithms, weighted back projection, ART and SIRT. The reconstructed volumes is expected to be read into the software package Amira (version 3.0 or higher) via a proprietary plug-in for further advanced visualization and analysis.  The plug-in shall allow for importing the Inspect3D output into an Amira-compatible format. The plug-in shall be included with the Inspect3D.  The Inspect3D shall run under Windows 2000 or Windows XP, advised configuration.

Item (2) Product #FP548037- Inspect3D Additional License
The government requires additional license for Inspect3D that allows for use of the software on an additional PC. 

Item (3) Product #FP5480/10 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) Tomography Data Acquisition Software
Shall provide a user friendly and fast way for the automatic acquisition of tilt series in High Angle Annular Dark Field ( HAADF) STEM mode. The data set shall be used with three-dimensional reconstruction and successive visualization.  The STEM Tomography Data Acquisition Software module requires the presence of STEM hardware with an HAADF detector as well as TEM tomography data acquisition software (shall be included in the Xplore3D suite). The STEM tomography data acquisition software must automatically determine the optimum acquisition position, at which sideways displacements and focus changes caused by the tilting are minimized.    

Government required delivery dated is January 2007.

The sole source determinations are based on the fact that the acquisition is to acquire software that must be compatible with existing hardware, i.e FEI Model TF, Electron Microscope S/N ND243. This system will be used to develop a new 3D nano seal imaging. Therefore, to conduct an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  


The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541519 and Standard Size is $23.5 million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  Inquiries to this announcement, referencing solicitation number NHLBI-PB (EB)-2007-057-DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,  Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.  Fax quotations will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00038.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open competition.  The NAICS code is 541620, size standard $6.5 million.   NCEA TECHNICAL  SUPPORT SERVICES Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human welfare (the  environment). As part of the NAAQS review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA),  historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The schedule for the  current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of  the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and sulfur oxides will be  reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised to produce a  peer-review draft that will be vetted at a peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science  Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and integration of the  available scientific knowledge base, pertaining to oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described  in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement to purchase a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System from Roche Applied Science PO BOX 50414/9115 Hague Rd .Indianapolis, IN 46250. The lightcycler is an instrument to perform quantitative nucleic acid quantization on extremely small samples. The instrument provides a means to quantitatively measure viral load, gene expression, and pathogen detection. This is a cornerstone technology of the EVPS group. Technical Considerations: The LightCycler 480 System uses a patented technology called Therma-Base to insure well-towel temperature homogeneity unmatched by any other system. Therma-Base overcomes the spreading resistance phenomenon that results in non-homogeneous temperature control across all other block-based real-time PCR systems. The use of this technology for real-time PCR is unique to Roche and has been exclusively licensed and a use patent has been filed. The LightCycler 480 System is the only system that allows 96-well and 384-well blocks to be switched in less than 5 minutes with no further warm-up or equilibration time. The system is ready for use as soon as the swap is completed without lengthy calibration by an instrument service engineer. The LightCycler 480 System is the only system to offer the use of licensed melting technology in a 96- or 384-well real-time PCR system. Other systems claim to have this technology, but only Roche has licensed it from the patent holder. The LightCycler 480 System is the only real-time PCR system that can offer 30 cycle, 384-wellruns in less than 40 minutes, including a short 5 minute activation time for the hot-start enzyme.96-well runs take less than an hour. The LightCycler 480 System is the only system built in a modular manner that allows service to be completed easily and rapidly by the exchange of instrument modules on-site by a trained service engineer. No trouble-shooting, no second-guessing. Error codes provide the necessary information to make the proper module exchange. The LightCycler 480 System software is the only software available on a block-based system that performs not only parallel-PCR and non-parallel standard curve fitting, but also accounts for non-linear standard curve efficiencies ensuring the highest degree of accuracy in data analysis calculations The system must produce data that uses the same method as the RAPID instrument. Data produced must be directly comparable.  The instrument must be able to produce backwardly compatible data with the Lightcyler 2.0 and Lightcycler 1.8 without the use of bridging studies. The algorithms used for the data analysis must be the same as these instruments. All responsible businesses that are capable of providing the Government with the item that is listed above may request a copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ) in writing or by FAX 301-480-3695 to the contracting office prior to the closing date of this notice. It is anticipated that the RFQ RFQ7009 will be available for fifteen days (15) after the publication release of this synopsis. Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release date of the RFQ. The anticipated award date is January, 25th 2007. Request for Copies of the RFQ must be submitted to the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 10401 Fernwood Rd, Suite 2NE70 Attn: Jemal Williams, Bethesda, MD 20892 or email: williamsje@niaid.nih.gov Fax quotations must contain offerors name , address, telephone and fax number. FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 Servers, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers, and related infrastructure equipment described in paragraph (2) have been identified as key components of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State.

<DESC>As mentioned at the pre-solicitation conference, the formal Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP), chaired by Ms. Sue Payton, SAF/AQ, was held on 20 Nov 2006, and the draft RFP was approved for release as a result of this meeting.  Also as a result of the ASP, an action item was taken for AF PEO/CM to draft a memo for OSD/AT&L to obtain approval of the CFT strategy and program to comply with OSD?s Acquisition of Services Policy.  To satisfy this action item, a meeting was held between AF PEO/CM, OSD/DPAP, and various others, including major CFT customer representatives.  As result of this meeting, additional concerns/questions regarding the CFT acquisition were raised by OSD/DPAP.  The following were of particular concern:  A) The contract length. (There is concern that seven years is too long to ?lock? offerors in and might significantly impact future competition.)  As a result of this concern, various shorter contract lengths are being discussed. B) The degree of customer buy-in.  (The concern is that there is not enough formal customer commitment to support of the program).  As a result of this concern, the four services have been requested to build business cases for their service?s continued use of CFT, with a focus on the top ten FY06 orders by service and dollar value.  C) The proposed CFT office structure. (The concern is that the proposed CFT office structure would be insufficient).  Different approaches to address this concern are being explored, to include:  joint staffing of the CFT office, decentralized ordering, and increasing the number of CFT personnel at OC-ALC.  After these issues are addressed, approval must still be received by OSD/AT&L prior to formal RFP release.  As answering these questions/concerns will impact the previously stated milestones, and could involve significant changes to the acquisition strategy, the process is hereby on hold indefinitely until the above issues can be resolved.  Due to this delay, offerors should be advised that the current CFT contracts will likely be extended to a maximum of six (6) months in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  If the maximum extension is utilized, the current contracts would expire on 31 Mar 2008.  As additional information becomes available, updates and revised milestones will be posted to www.fbo.gov.  The source selection team sincerely apologizes for the delay and any inconvenience potential offerors may have experienced.  We appreciate your continued interest in the CFT effort and your patience throughout the source selection process.

Section K?(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.  All Offerors must acknowledgment all amendments if any.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Specification, Past Performance, and price.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>Modification 01:  There was an error in the initial posting.  The following information was intended to be a Request for Information (RFI) coded as a Source Sought Notice, however, was incorrectly posted as a Presolicitation Notice.  Please note this change as it is intended to be a RFI. (End of Modification)

The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) seeks sources and information on how GIS shapefile or image based flood forecast showing flood extent could be brought to the general public in an efficient manner.  

Traditionally, NWS provides forecasts of river stages on our Nation?s rivers and streams in textual format, or with graphics showing river heights versus time (hydrographs).  To improve services to the people of the United States of America, NOAA/ NWS, Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) and River Forecast Centers (RFCs) have developed prototype flood forecast maps using geoprocessing software to produce GIS shapefiles or images.  The shapefiles or images display an expected flood extent based on forecast water surface profiles as simulated by the NWS hydraulic model FLDWAV.  Deterministic or probabilistic based flood forecast files can be produced every 6 hours on a daily basis, several times per day.  The spatial extent of the shapefiles/images focuses on certain portions along selected rivers within the United States of America and its Territories where hydraulic modeling has been developed and the appropriate detailed topographic data is available.

Submissions shall address one or several of the following salient topics:

1) Express a business interest in creating, storing and/or distributing flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or in using flood forecast shapefiles/images.

2) Provide (technical) information and sources regarding creation, storage and/or distribution of flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or on potential uses of flood forecast shapefiles/images.

3) Provide information on options for:
a) Nature of the shapefiles/images delivered by the Government, whether it should be in interim or final display formats including whether the images should be pre-generated and stored or generated on the fly.
b) Whether or not the Government should provide shapefiles/images to a third party who would then distribute to the public.
c) Estimated scale and costs

4) Interest in collaborations with NWS to publish flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or to use flood forecast shapefiles/images.

Vendors who believe they can meet one or some of the requirements are requested to submit in writing a response demonstrating that they can meet the Government's requirements.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed (technical) information and other (technical) literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Written responses must be received by February 10, 2007. This is not a request for proposal but rather a vehicle for obtaining information.  Responses should provide a point of contact, including representative name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number.  Questions and responses shall be sent via e-mail in Microsoft Word format to: Brian.J.Brown@noaa.gov and Reggina.Cabrera@noaa.gov .  No telephone requests will be honored.  The Government will not incur any cost as a result of this announcement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541612   U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HUMAN RESOURCES SUPPORT SERVICES RFQ-DC-07-00069 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, PART 2 Question #4:  Does the requirement require seven Senior Specialists to fill each of the areas described in Attachment A (Staffing, Classification, Labor  Relations, HR Development, HR Policy, Benefits, and Information Management) or one person that is proficient in all of the these fields?   Answer #4:  Several Human Resources specialists may be required for some of the areas.  For example, two to four staffing specialists may be needed.  The EPA  prefers specialists who are trained and specialized in specific areas of Human Resources.  However, one person may sufficiently do the work in more than one area if that person is experienced in one or more disciplines, such as staffing and classification.  However, the EPA may need specifically  the assistance of classifiers, as was recently the case, to conduct a special classification study for one of the program offices.  Additionally, the EPA has two Human Resources specialists who work in the Executive Resources Division, providing expertise in staffing, classification, and the  development of the Agency's Senior Executive Service employees.   Question #5:  For how many EPA employees will this requirement potentially support? Answer #5:  The Headquarters Human Resources Office provides staffing/recruitment services to EPA headquarters employees, which is approximately  7,500 people, and the general public, but not necessarily all at once.  For example, the contractors will work with supervisors, managers, and subject matter experts to complete job analyses and develop vacancy announcements and post them on the Agency's automated recruitment system.  When the  advertisement is open, they may respond to questions from both EPA employees and the public concerning the announcement and the status of applicants.   Question #6:  How many contractor personnel have supported this contract previously? Answer #6:  As few as two to three and as many as ten  contractor personnel have worked on this requirement previously.  The number depends on the projects and initiatives that occur during the course of the year.  Oftentimes, there is little notice if a new initiative comes up, requiring the EPA to gear up in a hurry to deliver products or services. Question #7:  In terms of recruiting responsibilities, what is the average number of job openings that this contract will support on a monthly basis? Answer #7:  The number varies.  The work is voluminous and exceeds the capacity of the federal employees available on staff.   Question #8:  Can  you provide more details on the topics for training and the number of people to participate in training sessions under this contract? Answer #8:  Training may vary as well, depending on what initiatives come up.  One example includes the conversion to the EPA's new performance management system  that was rolled out to all employees.  In Headquarters, the EPA needed contractor support for training on the new system.  The EPA continues to provide training to Headquarters managers, supervisors, and employees on this system.  Also, in 2003 and 2004, the agency offered an Early Out retirement  program.  The EPA quickly had to offer training to employees at Headquarters who were interested in availing themselves of the opportunity to retire early.  The training consisted of a number of courses to cover the many retirement options available to employees.  Approximately twenty training  sessions were held during one month with contractor assistance.

(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of business organizations interested in this requirement. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.     The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.     Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  

2.  Description.  Global Container Management (GCM) requirements include ensuring the Department of Defense (DOD) owns and can lease enough International Standards Organization (ISO) containers to meet contingency requirements while efficiently managing those containers when they are not in use. Containers used to deploy and sustain DOD and non-DOD customers around the world are government-owned (GO), government-leased (GL), or furnished by a transportation carrier.  Carrier- furnished (CF) containers may themselves be owned or leased by the carrier.  Containers are 20? and 40? dry, refrigerated (reefer), and high-cube (102? tall).  Another CM requirement is training users in the Integrated Booking System ? Container Management Module (IBS-CMM, hereafter referred to as CMM), a web-based centralized data base written in Microsoft Access, both in CONUS and theaters; during peace time and contingencies.    

2.1. Container Management in Theater.  SDDC uses military and commercial ships, truck, and rail to deliver containers into theaters of operation. They are then moved to destination via the theater distribution system. Containers delivered by commercial liner ships may become military responsibility upon clearing customs or only after the carrier has delivered to a specific consignee location (?door delivery?). CF containers delivered by liner ships accrue detention after the expiration of free time carriers allow. It is not cost effective to return all containers to sea-worthy condition nor return all sea-worthy containers to the Continental United States (CONUS). Combatant commanders may retain a portion of GO containers for future contingency or theater transload purposes. Containers remaining in theater must be stored, accounted for, tracked in a container management system, certified for sea movement (if required), tracked when moved, and reported on as required. In CENTCOM SDDC established a Container Management Element (CME) to exercise that direct authority while in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The CME functions under the operational control of CENTCOM via the CENTCOM Deployment & Distribution Operations Center (DDOC).

2.2. CONUS Container Management includes the inventory, tracking, accounting, maintenance, and certification of and reporting on GO and GL containers at power projection platforms (PPPs) and depots throughout CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii.  Inclusive is to program, budget, and fund GO containers for life-cycle costs. Container managers find efficient uses for idle containers such as short-term leasing.  

2.3. The contractor?s authority and responsibility for container management flow from SDDC?s role as the DOD Global Container Manager.  SDDC, in coordination with DOD Components, exercises direct authority over common user containers.  DOD container managers use CMM to: maintain in-transit and intra-theater visibility of all containers, manage GO and GL container pools, reduce detention and leasing costs by returning containers to owners, and produce standardized reports and performance metrics on theater container status for all activities.  The contractor will employ Container Management Teams (CMTs) at key nodes throughout theaters to maintain container inventory and accountability record quality and to provide for direct contact with container users and transporters.  Control, prioritization, and physical handling and movement of containers remain the responsibility of theater movement control elements and mode operators, who are to provide daily in/out gate and transload reports to the CME via CMM. The contractor will perform all CME responsibilities except those reserved to unit and agency movement control and distribution personnel.  In performing those responsibilities the contractor will interface with DDOC and component commander container managers.   

3. Requested Information.  Provide written responses to the Contracting Office not later than 12:00 p.m. CST 22 Jan 07.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Ms. Tamara Schuette at tamara.schuette@ustranscom.mil.  Subject line of the e-mail shall read:  Response to Container Management RFI.  

The RFI response shall be comprised of two (2) sections.

3.1. Section 1 of the response shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:  

3.1.1.  Points of Contact(s) including Name, company name, phone number, email and mailing address for the subject matter experts.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: Broad Area Announcement (BAA) 06-05-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: Fiscal Year (FY) 06 should be submitted by 30 December 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07; FY 09 by 1 May 08; FY 10 by 1 May 09 and, FY 11 by 1 May 10. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support Air Force communications as it applies to Modeling and Simulation, Enterprise Management, and Networking and Communication Links for the future Airborne Network (AN). Even though the primary technology area is modeling and simulation for AN, this BAA is open to solicitations in the areas of enabling technologies for AN.

The AN is the airborne extension of the Air Force's ConstellationNet portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG). 

The AN is defined to be an infrastructure that provides communication transport services through at least one node that is on a platform capable of flight.  This can best be visualized in the context of the operating domains served by the GIG.  The Transformational Communications Satellite System (TSAT) network will provide space connectivity and the GIG-Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) network together with networks such as those provided under the Combat Information Transport System and Theater Deployable Communications will provide surface connectivity.  Airborne connectivity within the GIG will be provided by the AN.  The AN will connect to both the space and surface networks, making it an integral part of the communications fabric of the GIG.

The AN will differ from the existing terrestrial and space-based networks due to the unique environment. The AN will be composed of subnetworks of heterogeneous networks and links. Airborne platforms will enter and leave different subnetworks and the AN as they transit through the area at speeds of up to Mach 2. Links making up the subnetworks and the AN will consist of a collection of differing types to include point-to-point, broadcast, ad hoc, simplex plus many other kinds. 

To realize the AF vision for the AN, this extension of the GIG in the airborne domain must be easy to use, configure, and maintain and must provide:

Ubiquitous and assured network access to all Air Force platforms; 

GIG core services whose integrity is assured; 

Quality appropriate to the commander's intent and rules of engagement (ROE);

Rapid response to mission growth, emerging events and changing mission priorities; 

End-to-end interoperation with joint services, coalition, and non-DoD partners and legacy systems in all physical network domains (sub-surface, surface, airborne and space); 

The eventual AN will exist on a variety of airborne platforms.  Each air asset/platform may have a different network role within the AN:

Legacy - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems capable of supporting voice, tactical data link (TDL), and possibly some point-to-point Internet Protocol (IP) network connections for very limited services (e.g., email only).  The term "legacy" also includes any non-IP enabled hardware/software on any platform.

Relay/Gateway - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems as described for a legacy node, but also include equipment that enable them to access multiple TDLs and to relay data Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), or transfer data formats from one link to another.

Network Access - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which provides an IP network connection to an AN or GIG network node.  Although these nodes are tethered to the network, they do not provide any AN service to other nodes on the network.

Network Capable - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can join an IP data network (Tactical Subnet) and provide limited AN service (e.g., transit routing) to other nodes on that local network.     

Internetwork - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can access and interconnect multiple IP data networks.  These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes when interconnected to the GIG through a Network Service Provider node.     

Network Service Provider - Airborne platforms, fixed or deployed ground facilities, or space-based packages equipped with IP network capable communications systems, which can access multiple IP data networks.  These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to interconnect with a GIG network (e.g., Defense Information Support Network (DISN), Joint Task Force (JTF) Service Component Network, etc.) service delivery node (SDN) and to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes.     

Candidate areas of research to solve AN-unique problems or show feasibility (or non-feasibility) of solutions that will enable the eventual fielding of this capability as applied/integrated to the airborne networking environment, include, but are not limited to: 

1) Airborne Networking Modeling and Simulation: Some of the areas are: Network Centric Warfare (NCW) based AN to the current set of Air Force missions and flexible enough to adapt to emerging mission sets; AN components modeling (e.g. Link 16 and Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)); measures of effectiveness and performance assessment; Man-in-the-loop and Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and experiments, analyses of mobile communication network node's [platforms] flight-plan-adjustments [metrics, mechanisms, algorithms, and equipment] to enable the optimization of communications performance and network connectivity; dynamic ad hoc networks management; mobile IP information routing; multi-mission network centric warfare environments; analysis of alternatives; support for real-time decision-making, dynamic situation assessment, dynamic prediction, predictive assessments, operationally focused/embedded simulation, theoretical foundations of decision science, course of action analyses; AN training; develop experimental hardware and software in the laboratory and conduct experiments and demonstrations; and perform integration and validation and verification of models, simulations, enterprise management performance, airborne link and routing performance, and other solutions as required.     It is expected that components will integrate into a complete M&S environment.     

2) Airborne Network Enterprise Management (EM):  This area can be broken down into six sub-areas, each with unique airborne asset considerations: event assessment, policy networking, course of action generation, mission-based understanding, cross-domain capability, and cross-cutting concerns (with includes security).     

         -     Event assessment may include the ability to "see" the status of nearby coalition, joint service or other component networks in order to obtain a larger perspective of network status.  The clustered nature of the AN, with nodes moving in and out of range of each other, will require consideration.     

         -     Policy Networking (i.e. policy-based networking) may be used to facilitate the need for manageable end-to-end, mission-based quality-of-service.     

         -     Courses of action could be generated by, but limited to, faster-than-real-time simulation, predictive network planning, established doctrine/policy, and documented response.  Course of action methods to reconfigure network nodes to compensate for an anomalous event could be based on prediction of topology and connectivity changes. 

         -     Mission understanding includes a "relative," individualized mission criticality as well as potential mapping to a larger globally accepted criticality.

         -         Cross-Domain capability:  Multi-layer security and monitoring/controlling multiple domains from a single domain based on mutual agreements.     

         -     Cross-cutting Concerns include (1) standardized methods (e.g. intelligent agents) for monitoring/managing (or tying to resident monitoring/managing capability) legacy systems; (2) Information Assurance (IA), as well as platform-based network defense, must be integrated into EM solutions; (3) Network Services should consider Domain Name Service (DNS), network time, network addressing, and service location services/protocol; (4) considerations for on-platform EM Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for inexperienced airborne operators; (5) DoD and AF projected architecture models and standards, e.g., service oriented architecture, IPv6 integration, etc.  This also includes Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES):  Application/Platform Services, Collaboration Services, Discovery Services, Enterprise Management Services, Messaging Services, Security Services, Storage Services, and User Assistance Services.

3) Airborne Networking and Communications Links:  We are looking for innovative ideas involving networking and communications links that will help enable this future capability. Such techniques and ideas may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: methods by which nodes will address and route traffic between heterogeneous subnetworks in conditions that are dynamic, with rapidly changing network topologies; methods to alleviate the impacts upon the network of changing connectivity with links/nodes entering/leaving networks; techniques to enable traffic priority and Quality of Service (QoS) to make optimal use of the limited resources possibly including the concepts of content delivery networking (CDN) and/or content-based routing; mechanisms to enable existing and future wire-line based protocols to operate over wireless links and networks as well as the means to handle the security and information assurance problems associated with using these protocols; mechanisms to enable the use of IPv4/IPv6 (dual-stack) in coexistence; policy-based networking techniques; new high bandwidth, high quality, communications links; advanced error detection, error correction and compressions schemes; and antenna designs for improved performance on airborne platforms.

4) Information Assurance for Airborne Networking: Innovative ideas are being sought to counter cyber-threats against both network control and data cyber-security attributes suitable for low data rate, low bandwidth, limited connectivity AN Environment. These attributes include Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and non-repudiation, across the airborne network architectures. Routing across Heterogeneous RF Links and Nets, as well as connection to ground entry points in the GIG, needs to be factored in the design. Areas being sought include the understanding of the cyber threats in the AN environment, and responsive IA capability to counter such threats. This includes the testing and integration of mobile, manageable, low network overhead, IA sensors and network technology to enhance operational C2 system capabilities capable of differentiating between naturally occurring disturbances and human made, disruption, delay, destroy, deny and degradation (5Ds). Another key area is End-to-End Information Assurance performance metrics and integrated network visualization concepts.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Next Generation Sensor Concepts.  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments. The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys. Upgrades to existing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed. Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar. These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions. Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas. Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense. Additional technology areas include the measurement, test, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of advanced radar systems. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising technologies for both monostatic and multistatic radar sensors in the areas of Space Time Adaptive Processing, both Adaptive and Knowledge Based (KB), Multi-Channel Signal Processing Techniques, Innovative and Wideband Processing Techniques, Multi-Dimensional Processing Techniques, Improved radar system performance developments in spread doppler clutter environment for a theater application and, in general, technologies that may significantly improve the performance of advanced radar systems. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.

<DESC>COATING REMOVAL ON AIRCRAFT PARTS

Looking for Sources in the Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo, Colorado area who can perform coating removal on aircraft parts using TURCO 5668 Chemical process. One year contract with potential for several option years.

 Coating must be removed from aircraft parts of a wide variety of geometries. For simplicity these can be group in three categories; long slender parts, panels, and bulk parts.
1.	Long slender parts are typical of wing spars. Based on typical aircraft geometries the longest spar would be about 37 feet long however, it is expected this piece would need to be sectioned into a more manageable size. Therefore, the slender part geometry can be considered to be approximately 4 feet long.
2.	Some panel geometries have dimensions as large as 10.25 feet. Here again, in order to make parts more manageable panels can be assumed to be sectioned to dimensions of approximately 5 feet long by 3 feet wide.
3.	Bulk parts include a wide variety of fittings. These parts can be assumed to fit within a 3 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot envelope.
4.	The stripping system needs to be set-up and operational as soon as possible. 

5.  Parts for stripping will be provided by the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  Stripped parts will be returned to the USAFA.

6.  If you are interested and can perform this coating removal process using TURCO 5668 Chemical process, please contact
contact Michael Fredericks at 10MSG/LGCB for more information
719-333-2849 or michael.fredericks@usafa.af.mil no later than 19 January 07.

Description:
This performance specification describes the performance requirements for a managed, Layer-2 switching, 10/100/1000 Base-T commercial Ethernet Switch to be used for a non-flight critical avionics bus on the A/MH-6M aircraft.  The Ethernet Switch shall have a minimum of 10 commercial ports that are fully interoperable with other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment.  The Ethernet Switch shall be packaged as a single line replaceable unit (LRU).  One Ethernet switch is required for each aircraft (quantity addressed further below).  The Ethernet Switch shall be required to pass MIL-STD-810F environmental testing and MIL-STD-461E E3 testing.  The Ethernet Switch shall be fully IEEE 802.3 compliant.

1.0	Real-Time Deterministic Services:  The switch shall operate in a deterministic manner with guaranteed delivery and bounded latency, and compliant with ARINC 664, part 5, Profiled Aircraft Data Networks.

2.0	Ethernet Ports:  The Ethernet Switch shall have a minimum 10 commercial full-duplex ports.

3.0	Additional ports:  The Ethernet Switch shall have one non-dedicated data load port.  An out of band serial management port and a 10/100 Base-T debug port are desired.

4.0	Connectors:  The Ethernet switch shall have MIL-SPEC connectors suitable for aviation use.  

5.0	Software:  The software shall be RTCA/DO-178B Level C compliant.  The system should be capable of power-up built in test (PBIT), initiated built-in-test (IBIT), and continuous built-in-test (CBIT).  The software should allow flexible network management, monitoring, and configuration capability via Command Line Interface (CLI), Telnet, Web, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) interfaces.

6.0	Power:  The Ethernet switch shall comply with MIL-STD-704A 28VDC aircraft power interface requirements.  The switch operations shall not be affected by voltage transients down to 15 VDC or up to 40 VDC lasting up to 100 ms.  Power dissipation shall be no greater than 40 watts during peak power operation.

7.0	Cooling:  The switch shall not require active cooling and should be designed to operate continuously between -40?a C and +55?a C.

8.0	Profiled Aircraft Data Network:   The Ethernet Switch shall be fully operable in a Compliant Aircraft Data Network, as defined by ARINC Specification 664.

9.0	Policy-Based Forwarding Service Requirements:  The Ethernet Switch shall check the fields of each frame, and forward frames that meet the valid criteria.  The Ethernet switch shall evaluate the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of a frame contained in the frame check sequence field according to IEEE 802.3.  In case a reception failure is detected, the frame should be discarded.  The Ethernet Switch shall drop an incoming frame which size is greater than the maximum allowed frame size associated with it.  This value shall be configurable for values between minimum and maximum permissible frame size.

10.0	  Switching Services:  The Ethernet Switch shall implement ??Store-and-forward?? mechanism to allow frame integrity filtering prior to initiating the forwarding process.  The Ethernet Switch shall discard corrupted frames.

11.0	  Frame Forwarding:  The Ethernet Switch should be designed to avoid head-of-line blocking.  Head-of-line blocking is frame loss or added delay caused by an input interface which is attempting to forward frames to both an uncongested and congested output interface, resulting in frames dropped or delayed at the uncongested output due to congestion in the congested output.  The Ethernet Switch shall drop frames only for the congested port.  The uncongested ports shall remain unaffected.

12.0	 Fault Detection:  The Ethernet Switch shall monitor the status of its centralized functions as well as network interfaces in-accordance-with (IAW) IEEE Std 802.3 and 802.1D.

13.0	  Performance Requirements:  The Ethernet Switch shall meet the requirements as defined by ARINC specification 664, Part 5, Para 4.10.

14.0	  Maximum Switch Transit Delay:  The Ethernet Switch shall meet the latency requirements defined by ARINC specification 664, Part 5, Para 4.10.4.4.  The maximum latency induced by the Ethernet Switch for any time frame should be less than 1 ms. 

15.0	  Operational Requirements:  The Ethernet Switch shall be compliant with ARINC Specification 664, Part 5, Para 4.11.

16.0	  Configuration Tables:  The Ethernet Switch shall use configuration tables in order to make policy-based forwarding decisions.  Consequently, configuration tables shall be uploadable to enable evolution of system architecture.  The table shall be sized such that a minimum of 256 traffic flows are supported by the switch.

17.0	  Electromagnetic Testing:  The Ethernet switch shall meet MIL-STD-461E, Requirements for Control of Electromagnetic Interference, Emissions and Susceptibility.  The following tests are required:  RE101, CS 101, CS114, CS115, CS116, and RS 101.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Sun Mid Range Computers, SOLARIS, Sun Branded Hitachi SAN,  Seibel Software, Sun Client Solutions, IT Hardware, Software, Services
<DESC>GSA intends to procure via the NASA Scientific Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) III contracts two SOLARIS based Sun Fire 25K, 8 CPU, 16 GB mid range configured computer systems, additional quantities of Sun-branded Hitachi 9990 configured Storage Area Network arrays, approximately 150-hours of Sun client solutions professional services, and additional Seibel software licenses and maintenance. All of these items are for acquisition on a specific make and model and all-or-none basis through the NASA SEWP III contracts. The items and services procured by GSA are on behalf of the client, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to support their agency-wide major applications standardization program migration which standardized on SOLARIS based systems.  The rationale GSA approved is provided here as required by FAR Part 5.201 (a )(6) when authority for the acquisition is under FAR Part 6.302-1(c ) specific make and model or name brand when no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). That is, before going to SEWP III per their ordering instructions CMS is justifying its actions beforehand, as in past phases, but now with notice.  This is Phase 6 of a multi-phase standardization program-plan-approach where previous phases completed over the past 36-months are all similarly justified.  BACKGROUND: HHS CMS is the largest insurance company in the world.  CMS expends $500 billion annually providing for more than 80 million beneficiaries while processing 1 billion claims annually. CMS manages more than 1/3 of the nations healthcare expenditures, which amount to 5% of the Nations GDP. In an effort to streamline the CMS Information Technology Services, CMS is striving to implement IT standards that will reduce overall IT costs and reduce the number of systems that it manages on a daily basis. The Information Technology Modernization Group (ITMG) is responsible for the implementation of many of these standards, and to this end ITMG is committed to provide hardware, software, policies, and procedures that are standardized on proven technology and industry best practices. CMS has standardized through the publication of major architecture documents such as the Internet Architecture, Web-Enabled Application Architecture, Enterprise Messaging Architecture, and Application Developers Guide. Through the use of these documents, policies, and industry best practices, CMS standardization on these architectures commenced some 30 months ago where a significant number of present CMS applications are now fully operational under this standard. Standards, however, are only as good as the policies and procedures that back them up, and thus some specific requirements developed are to ensure that hardware and software meet these standards. CMS has instituted a policy that Sun Solaris will be the Operating System standard for future business application development on the mid tier using J2EE. Thus, one of the major Operating System specifications that is now part of the CMS Target Architecture is Sun Solaris running on Sun Microsystems Servers. As part of this Target Architecture, CMS has identified Hitachi, SUN SAN as the SAN and Storage Management hardware for the Mid-Tier Environment. The CMS Target Architecture can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/TargetArchitecture.pdf The Solaris architecture is currently within the Agencys Technical Reference Model (TRM). Solaris is a proven technology in the IT industry. This combined with the performance of Sun Microsystems hardware, Java software services, and published policies and procedures governing Application Development, places CMS in a substantially higher quadrant for success in our business application area than ever before. CMS has made the decision to use the Solaris operating system as the standard for the Agencys defined Three Zone Architecture. The Internet Architecture (Three Zone Architecture) in summary is - The Architecture for the CMS Internet platform is a three zone architecture with each zone separated by firewalls to support web application systems. The first or outermost zone supports web servers only and is called the Presentation Region or De-Militarized Zone (DMZ). The second or middle zone supports only business logic for the applications and is called the Application Region. The third or innermost zone, called the Secure Region or Protected Region, contains the database servers used by the web applications. Additional network segments will exist to support specialized network services such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Domain Naming Services (DNS), etc. The full publication describing the approved CMS Internet Architecture can be found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/InternetArchitecture.pdf Other CMS approved standards documents include: J2EE Application Developers Guide as of November 5, 2004 found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/J2EEApplicationDevelopmentGuidelines.pdf Siebel 7.7 Guidelines as of March 3, 2006 found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/Siebel77Guidelines.pdf Target Architecture as of September 2004 found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/TargetArchitecture.pdf A complete list of CMS Standard Documents including the above are found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/09_Standards.asp#TopOfPage The use of such name brand descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Governments requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product brand of another manufacturer because: CMS has standardized on [SOLARIS based] Sun Microsystems Hardware and Sun Branded Hitachi Storage Arrays to provide a consistent hardware platform that CMSs developers understand and can develop systems on thus providing a full systems life cycle environment in which Medicare and Medicaid Business Applications run. A change in this environment through the use of other non-Sun Microsystems hardware would impose additional risk and potential cost impacts to the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. The additional risks to these programs would place CMS in a delicate balance between meeting legislative mandates for these programs and FAR requirements for other than full and open competition for non-brand specific hardware and software. CMS has invested considerable training dollars and staff hours understanding the Internet Architecture hardware to adequately support this environment. Additionally, the potential for cost impacts are high due to time and effort to evaluate and integrate this hardware into the Internet Architecture and identifying the minor differences in implementation of non-Sun Microsystems hardware and software and that of CMS Internet Architecture hardware based on Sun Microsystems enterprise and mid range servers. This notice affords adequate opportunity for relevant and timely inquiries to the CO on factual disagreements supported by substantive information and is not intended to result in offers although the client SOW and Price Tables are included for information purposes only. It is instead as full disclosure of the intent to go to SEWP III to make the buy under the most favorable conditions feasible all factors considered, understanding the above explanation of the HHS CMS Systems Standards Program.  Client agency intends continuing their three-tier internet SOLARIS based systems standard until they are convinced, separate and apart from this acquisition of the validity and cost effectiveness of any other recommended approach.  Should there be questions or concerns these must be in writing and sufficiently detailed.  Send these to the GSA Contracting Officer at e-mail address Jon.Faye@GSA.GOV with a copy to David.Krohmal@GSA.GOV .  The alternate CO, Howard Parker need not receive a copy as he will only be involved in this matter if for some reason I am no longer available to complete the action.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will play a central role in the development of policy and strategies for humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other designated vulnerable groups for the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be a member of the Technical Assistance Group. Located within the Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM), the Technical Assistance Group (TAG), was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster relief mandate. TAG is sub-divided into various groups that address Food Security, Shelter and Settlements, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The incumbent will also play a central role in the implementation of the USAID's IDP and protection policies and coordination within USAID, and in conjunction with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, donors, and non-governmental partners.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will have substantial knowledge of current development and disaster theory and research regarding IDPs and protection, and practical experience in the field, working with private voluntary organizations (PVOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or international organizations (IOs) at resettlement or disaster response locations.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The DRM Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster contexts.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, the Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).  

OFDA is mandated to respond rapidly to emergencies, providing assistance to those populations that have been uprooted from their homes, known as internally displaced persons.  There are an estimated 25 million people displaced throughout the world.   Internally displaced persons often are among the neediest and most vulnerable populations in a disaster situation.  They are separated from their houses and property, their lands, and sometimes their families, torn from their livelihoods.

OBJECTIVE

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be assigned to the TAG and will work closely with the staff of the Office of the Director.  The incumbent will be a senior advisor to OFDA on policy and program issues regarding protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations. 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The position involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of USAID policy and programs within a broad and complex geographic and functional specialty area.  This requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradictory.  The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance to the decisions and actions of senior policy officials, and to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  As part of this effort, the advisor must be able to rapidly identify and anticipate problem issues, help formulate strategic and programming priorities, and write under tight deadlines to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues as well as keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments. The work requires extremely strong writing and verbal skills.  

Collaboration with other offices, bureaus and agencies within and outside of the USG is also critical to this position.  Contacts will be with the Department of State and USAID employees at all levels, personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in other agencies, congressional staff, experts, United Nations (UN) staff, representatives of other donor governments, consultants, researchers and educators, and officials of non-governmental organizations.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings in Washington, foreign capitals, and in the field.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will participate in open meetings and conferences where s/he may be called upon to explain and defend USAID activities/approaches with regard to internal displacement and protection. 

Specific duties and responsibilities are as follows:

* Serve as an authoritative source of information on and analysis of internal displacement and protection issues for OFDA.  Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations;


* Help coordinate development of clear and articulate policy on internally displaced persons and protection issues for OFDA and USAID in general.  Make decisions and provide guidance that significantly affect OFDA and Agency IDP and protection policies;

* Serve as a key member of and provide guidance and direction to the DCHA Protection Working Group;

* Prepare OFDA senior management and DCHA senior leadership, where necessary, to speak on IDP and Protection issues before UN bodies, NGOs, Congress and other parts of the USG;

* Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with UN agencies and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of protection and IDPs; 

* Coordinate and provide front line communication with the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) regarding the development of strategies addressing displaced populations;

* Respond to relevant congressional and public inquiries and speak to various visiting groups about protection and displaced persons;

* Improve awareness and expertise of OFDA staff on IDP and protection issues.  Assist OFDA with better integration of IDP needs and protection issues into normal humanitarian relief, transition, and developmental programs;

* Coordinate with the OFDA Technical Assistance Group's IDP/Protection Specialist and with the Humanitarian Coordination Specialist within the Office of the Director in the development of IDP and protection policies, strategies, and program standards;

* Based on analysis and research, clarify and define USAID's leadership role within the USG in relation to IDP issues, including providing country-specific recommendations on how to address IDP needs;

* Coordinate with the various DCHA offices, including the Office of Transitions Initiatives (OTI), Office of Food for Peace (FFP), Office of Democracy and Governance (DG), Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Office of Program, Policy, and Management (PPM) on IDP and Protection issues;  

* Work with counterparts in other donor organizations to exchange information, establish meetings, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities regarding IDPs; and coordinate these activities with relevant DCHA offices; 

* Articulate IDP and protection policies to personnel within OFDA, the DCHA Bureau, USAID Missions and other USAID Bureaus, and to other U.S. Government agencies, other donors, and implementing partners, through participation in conferences, speaking engagements, and field visits;

* Participate in OFDA grant review process as needed, including reviewing partner proposals and providing technical recommendations;

* Assist OFDA staff to translate policies and strategies into effective programming, as needed;

* Represent USAID on multi-donor missions to emergency situations in the field;

* Travel to the field as needed, sometimes on short notice, for possible durations of several weeks;

* Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis;

* Serve as a member of the Washington-based Response Management Team (RMT), which provides services and support to Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) deployed in response to disasters. The duties on the Response Management Team will be varied.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is 
100% set-aside for small business.  

In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), to be considered for award under a small business set-aside, both the manufacturer and distributor must be a small business under the NAICS code classification identified above.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Manufacturing Metrology Division, as part of the Intrinsic Force Standards Competence Effort, has a requirement for a vacuum cryogenic probe station for the development and testing of instrumentation for low-temperature atomic break-junction experiments.

Often, cryogenic probe stations are used for electronic testing of circuits and devices at low temperature, and the mechanical behavior of the station and the probes is not critical.  In this case, however, the system will be used to test prototypes of ultra-sensitive mechanical devices, primarily custom-designed, state-of-the-art force and displacement transducers.  

This testing requires a system that is of sturdy physical construction and that is well isolated from external vibrations originating either from the floor (through a vibration isolation table) or from the vacuum pumping system (through flexible stainless-steel bellows pumping lines).   Long operating cycles (10-12 hours or more) at a stable cryogenic operating temperature (for example, 5 K plus or minus 0.1 K) without any temperature excursions (glitches) caused by actions like the changing of the helium supply dewar are also required for successful device characterization.

All quoters shall provide a quotation for a quantity of one (1) each Vacuum Cryogenic Probe Station, which meets or exceeds all of the following required specifications.  All equipment must 
be new. 


BASIC SYSTEM
1.	Vacuum chamber must accommodate up to six electrical or fiber probes simultaneously.  Unused probe positions shall be sealed with blank plates suitable for additional customer-fabricated electrical and optical-fiber feed-throughs.  At a minimum, the chamber must be able to accommodate specimens that are 50 mm in diameter by 10 mm high.  Larger specimen sizes are preferred;

EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD
Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability: Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement, 2) Past Experience,
3) Past Performance, and Price.  

Technical Capability, Past Experience and Past Performance, when combined, are equal in importance to price.
  
Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all specifications, and clearly documents that the offered products meet or exceed the specifications stated above.

In evaluating technical capability, strongest consideration shall be given to:  Best possible temperature stability over period of time, particularly at liquid helium temperatures; Fastest time for specimen exchange; and Largest specimen size.  

In addition, the Government has a desire to have this system mounted on a fully functional vibration isolation system.  The vibration isolation system must provide isolation from floor vibrations and achieve the following:  (a) Vibration transmissibility below 0.01 for frequencies above 10 Hz as measured between the floor and sample stage; (b)  Resonance free isolation in vertical and horizontal directions beginning at 0.7 Hz, with floor to specimen vibration transmissibility that falls off at a rate of 40 dB per decade of frequency from resonance until 10 Hz and never rises above a value of 0.01 for frequencies between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz, such as is now typical of active vibration control mounts. Award is not contingent on this feature, however, if quoted, the Government will consider the purchase of this feature based on the value to the Government, technical merit and price considered.
		
Past Experience will be evaluated to determine the degree of vendors? experience in successfully manufacturing comparable systems.  The Contractor shall describe their previous experience in manufacturing, assembling and providing similar systems and provide the number of systems manufactured and provided.  The degree of relevance between previously manufactured systems and the proposed system shall be considered.   

Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and information provide by NIST and its? affiliates.  Quoters shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided within a three (3) year period.  

The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the company or organization and the reference contact person; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract; the address and telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

bar code markings are required on Military Shipping Labels
in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December
15, 2002 (but see DLAD 52.211-9010(D) for exceptions to the
requirement for MSL and 2D symbols).  See the DLA packaging
web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change
notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply.  2D bar coding shall be
in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3)
and DoD 4500.9-R.  MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar

shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD
52.211-9010(C).  Except for the Transportation Control Number
(TCN), which must always be present on the Military Shipping
Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as
defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available
from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the field is
not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be
left blank.  If there are inconsistencies between the schedule

(xvii)  The Point of Contact for this item is:  Christopher Gloyd, E-Mail: christopher.gloyd@det.amedd.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c ) (1).  The FAR citation implementing this authority is Part 6.302-1 (b) (2) Only One Responsible Source.  Reason for Authority Cited:  This authority is cited du e to Synthes being the only manufacturer, seller, and distributor of its orthopedic surgical implants.  The Food and Drug Administration requires FDA approval for all medical products used invasively. These products are intended for United States citizens abroad.  FDA approval is also required for use on troop population. Failure to establish this contract will seriously harm the Government in that it will jeopardize the Army Medical Departments (AMEDD) ability to surgically care for its patients.  This sp ecific procurement is for Synthes brand parts only.  Synthes is one of several orthopedic implant manufacturers that provide orthopedic implants.  However, the use of a specific manufacturers product is a physician decision based upon the patients medica l diagnosis and prognosis, product and clinical e fficacy, and the surgeons expertise using a specific product.  Each of the available manufacturers products are not compatible with other manufacturers products. B.C. Baker III Contracting Officer Approved for release

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is (1) to provide the Government answers to questions received in response to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation No. CM1301-7-RQ-0005 and (2) to change the Small Business Size Standard from 100 to 500 employees.

(1) Questions and Answers: 

Question No. 1:  Based on the scale of this solicitation, can you extend the response deadline of January 9, 2007. 

DOC Response:  The response deadline of January 9, 2007 has been changed to read January 12, 2007, at 12:00 pm (noon).  Amendment No. 1, to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice, was posted 12/20/ 2006.

Question No. 2:  Information required for resellers to respond to this requirement is being gathered; can the due date to the solicitation be extended to January 16, 2007?

DOC Response:  See response to Question No. 1 above.  

Question No. 3a:  Please provide clarification on CLIN 0003?  Is this for 10 days or for 1 year?   CLIN 0003-Support for Installation/Testing of Software for ten (10) consecutive business days. 

DOC Response:  CLIN 0003 - Support for Installation/Testing of Software for ten (10) consecutive Business days is part of the BASE PERIOD.   There is no repeat of this CLIN in the OPTION PERIODs.   

Question No. 3b:  According to the solicitation, the Government intends to conduct a ten (10) day technical evaluation.  What is the scope and of the 10 day evaluation for installation/testing?  When will Government provide the success criteria or additional detail on the tasks to be performed in this evaluation?  This will better enable offerors to ensure that the most appropriate resources are on hand to support the optimal level of success and evaluation of its proposed electronic communications and messaging solutions. 

DOC Response:  The scope of effort for the resellers will be limited to installation and configuration of the software on Government Furnished Equipment, and user support.  The requirements are an internal document and will not be published to the offerors.

Question No. 4:  Concerning this initiative and the incumbent currently providing work to this.  Is it possible to get a list of all or some of these providers? 

DOC Response:  Each bureau within DOC may have one or many contracts for their messaging licenses and maintenance.  Some bureaus (or some of the organizations within a bureau) may be on an enterprise contract.  At this time there is no central repository of information that has information on who are the service providers and/or who they provide service for.  In any event, that data is unnecessary to respond to this requirement for licenses.

Question No. 5:  Will there be a second procurement for integration services for the selected email solution following this one for SW licenses?  If so at what point is this procurement expected? 

DOC Response:  Until there has been a selection of the product, DOC will not be able to determine if there will be a second procurement.

Question No. 6:  What mechanism will the government use for the procurement of hardware infrastructure for the deployment of the consolidated email solution?

DOC Response:  See response to Question 5 above.

Question No. 7a:  The solicitation specifies the submission of past experience and past performance.  Does the Department of Commerce (Government) require this information from the product vendor or the [small business] reseller?  

DOC Response: The Government requires that information be submitted from the small business reseller.  Past Experience:  Quoters shall provide three (3) references for which the Quoter has provided products and services similar in size and scope to those under this Quotation.  The Quoter shall include the company/agency name, Point of contact, telephone number; fax number and e-mail address.  Past Performance:  Quoters shall provide at least three projects within the last 3 years that display the Quoters past performance with procurements of similar size and scope to those under this requirement, as an authorized software provider.

Question No. 7b:  The evaluation criteria in the solicitation appear to intend that the reseller (Quoter) provide its past experience and past performance for similar scope of procurements that are not necessarily the same technology as that planned for acquisition under this contract.  Please clarify.  

DOC Response:  Resellers are to provide past experience and past performance for procurements of similar scope.  These may be different acquisitions but they must be of 
similar scope and nature to the requirements under this acquisition.

Question No. 8:  According to the solicitation, the Government intends to conduct a ten (10) day technical evaluation.  What is the scope of the 10 day evaluation for installation/testing?  When will Government provide the success criteria or additional detail on the tasks to be performed in this evaluation?  This will better enable offerors to ensure that the most appropriate resources are on hand to support the optimal level of success and evaluation of its proposed electronic communications and messaging solutions.

DOC Response:  The Government intends to evaluate each product for compatibility with DOC current infrastructure across its bureaus.  This testing is internal to DOC, and does not impact upon submissions under this combined synopsis solicitation.  The Government intends to fulfill its minimum ordering requirements, as stated in this RFQ.  

Question No. 9:  When will the Government provide additional details for the messaging requirements (i.e., functional capabilities evaluated under the solicitation)?

DOC Response:  This procurement is for a maximum requirement for 50,000 licenses. The software product must contain a fully integrated desktop client and product suite which includes:  email, calendar, task, contact, instant messaging, global address, web access, and directory services (if required). The size of the mailboxes and further similar details are immaterial for purposes of this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

Question No. 10:  The solicitation does not appear to specify any specific platforms and/or desktop requirements.  This vendor understands that there are a number of platforms currently supported within the DOC (e.g., Windows, Linux and versions of UNIX, etc.).  Does the Government require the proposed electronic communication and messaging solution be able to support all the platforms specified above?  How does the Government intend to evaluate Quoters proposed product solutions in regards to scope of platform support for DOC systems? 

DOC Response:  The expectations are that the software will perform on all current, stable, in production, releases of the existing operating systems within the DOC for both desktop/web and server environments

Question No. 11:  According to the solicitation there are a number of messaging systems used within Commerce to date. Is there a desktop requirement for thick vs. thin client?  Does the Government intend to evaluate Quoters proposed product solutions in regards to its type of client support as part of this solicitation?

DOC Response:  The software must perform in both thick and thin desktop environments.

Question No. 12:  In the requirement to support instant messaging capabilities, does the Government require any of the following related capabilities that provide value to the end user community: Ability to securely access to public Instant messaging; Ability to securely store and log instant messaging and/or chat history?  Will any of these capabilities be factored in to the evaluation criteria for this solicitation?

DOC Response:  Public instant messaging ? No  Ability to securely store and log history - No

Question No. 13:  As part of the evaluation of the proposed vendor product solutions, does the Government intend to take into consideration additional desktop software dependencies of the vendors proposed software in its cost evaluation?  That is, if a vendors messaging solution has dependencies on specific versions of additional required programs or other software programs running simultaneously on a DOC end users desktop, will the deployment and/or upgrade of those other programs be evaluated as a cost consideration for that vendor solution?

DOC Response:   Yes, the Government does intend to take into consideration the cost for additional software or products to perform the requirements stated for a fully integrated desk top client and product suite which includes email, calendar, task, contacts, instant messaging, global address, web access, and directory services (if required) however; desktop upgrades are outside the scope of this effort.

Question No. 14:  There are nine LARs who are able to sell to the public sector. We are unaware of any other LAR that meets the NAICS 423430 criteria. Please consider removing the NAICS 423430 criteria and simply specifying small business instead.

DOC Response:  DOC has determined that given the size and complexity of this Department wide requirement that DOC needs can only be satisfactorily met by a resellers that has been currently qualified by GSA and is on the GSA Schedule 70, Information Technology (IT) Schedule, Special Item (SIN) 132-33, Perpetual Software Licensees.  

Question No. 15:  The Combined Synopsis/Solicitation No. CM1301-7-RQ-0005 states that the corresponding NAICS code of 423430 with associated small business standard of 100 employees.  When reviewing the SBA web site for government procurement, it appears to state that "The non-manufacturer size standard of 500 employees shall be used for purposes of Government procurement of supplies".  It is difficult to tell exactly where this statement applies but appears to apply to most IT procurements.  Does this statement on the SBA site allow a small business to be defined as 500 employees or less for your procurement?

DOC Response:  DOC will issue an Amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation changing the small business definition from 100 employees to 500 employees.

Question No. 16:  My company is an IBM Lotus Partner and we meet the small business set aside requirements for solicitation CM1301-7-RQ-0005.  I noticed the solicitation references Large Account Reseller (LAR) on several occasions.  This terminology is specific to the Microsoft federal reseller program.  We are an IBM Lotus partner we are not a member of the Microsoft LAR program.  We would like to respond with the IBM Lotus solution.
 
Are we precluded from responding since we are not a Microsoft LAR? 

DOC Response:  Your company is not precluded from responding to this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

Question No. 17:  This vendor understands that there are a number of agencies within Commerce who support have high-availability / messaging server clustering within their current messaging solutions. Does the Government require the proposed electronic communication and messaging solution be able to support clustering of the messaging server/high availability?  How does the Government intend to evaluate proposed product solutions in regards to server clustering and high availability? 

DOC Response:  We expect the solution to be highly available.  

Question No. 18:  For this requirement CM13017RQ0005 is there an incumbent.  If so, please provide the following information: contractors name, contract number, date, expiration date and value.

DOC Response:  This is a new procurement and there is no incumbent.

(2) The NAICS code is 423430 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be a member of the Technical Assistance Group.

The incumbent will also play a central role in the implementation of the USAID's IDP and protection policies and coordination within USAID, and in conjunction with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, donors, and non-governmental partners.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will have substantial knowledge of current development and disaster theory and research regarding IDPs and protection, and practical experience in the field, working with private voluntary organizations (PVOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or international organizations (IOs) at resettlement or disaster response locations.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The DRM Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster contexts.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, the Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).  

OFDA is mandated to respond rapidly to emergencies, providing assistance to those populations that have been uprooted from their homes, known as internally displaced persons.  There are an estimated 25 million people displaced throughout the world.   Internally displaced persons often are among the neediest and most vulnerable populations in a disaster situation.  They are separated from their houses and property, their lands, and sometimes their families, torn from their livelihoods.

OBJECTIVE

The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will be assigned to the TAG and will work closely with the staff of the Office of the Director.  The incumbent will be a senior advisor to OFDA on policy and program issues regarding protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations. 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The position involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of USAID policy and programs within a broad and complex geographic and functional specialty area.  This requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradictory.  The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance to the decisions and actions of senior policy officials, and to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  As part of this effort, the advisor must be able to rapidly identify and anticipate problem issues, help formulate strategic and programming priorities, and write under tight deadlines to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues as well as keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments. The work requires extremely strong writing and verbal skills.  

Collaboration with other offices, bureaus and agencies within and outside of the USG is also critical to this position.  Contacts will be with the Department of State and USAID employees at all levels, personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in other agencies, congressional staff, experts, United Nations (UN) staff, representatives of other donor governments, consultants, researchers and educators, and officials of non-governmental organizations.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings in Washington, foreign capitals, and in the field.  The Senior Internal Displacement and Protection Advisor will participate in open meetings and conferences where s/he may be called upon to explain and defend USAID activities/approaches with regard to internal displacement and protection. 

Specific duties and responsibilities are as follows:

* Serve as an authoritative source of information on and analysis of internal displacement and protection issues for OFDA.  Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to protection, IDPs and other vulnerable populations;


* Help coordinate development of clear and articulate policy on internally displaced persons and protection issues for OFDA and USAID in general.  Make decisions and provide guidance that significantly affect OFDA and Agency IDP and protection policies;

* Serve as a key member of and provide guidance and direction to the DCHA Protection Working Group;

* Prepare OFDA senior management and DCHA senior leadership, where necessary, to speak on IDP and Protection issues before UN bodies, NGOs, Congress and other parts of the USG;

* Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with UN agencies and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of protection and IDPs; 

* Coordinate and provide front line communication with the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) regarding the development of strategies addressing displaced populations;

* Respond to relevant congressional and public inquiries and speak to various visiting groups about protection and displaced persons;

* Improve awareness and expertise of OFDA staff on IDP and protection issues.  Assist OFDA with better integration of IDP needs and protection issues into normal humanitarian relief, transition, and developmental programs;

* Coordinate with the OFDA Technical Assistance Group's IDP/Protection Specialist and with the Humanitarian Coordination Specialist within the Office of the Director in the development of IDP and protection policies, strategies, and program standards;

* Based on analysis and research, clarify and define USAID's leadership role within the USG in relation to IDP issues, including providing country-specific recommendations on how to address IDP needs;

* Coordinate with the various DCHA offices, including the Office of Transitions Initiatives (OTI), Office of Food for Peace (FFP), Office of Democracy and Governance (DG), Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Office of Program, Policy, and Management (PPM) on IDP and Protection issues;  

* Work with counterparts in other donor organizations to exchange information, establish meetings, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities regarding IDPs; and coordinate these activities with relevant DCHA offices; 

* Articulate IDP and protection policies to personnel within OFDA, the DCHA Bureau, USAID Missions and other USAID Bureaus, and to other U.S. Government agencies, other donors, and implementing partners, through participation in conferences, speaking engagements, and field visits;

* Participate in OFDA grant review process as needed, including reviewing partner proposals and providing technical recommendations;

* Assist OFDA staff to translate policies and strategies into effective programming, as needed;

* Represent USAID on multi-donor missions to emergency situations in the field;

* Travel to the field as needed, sometimes on short notice, for possible durations of several weeks;

* Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis;

* Serve as a member of the Washington-based Response Management Team (RMT), which provides services and support to Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) deployed in response to disasters. The duties on the Response Management Team will be varied.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.

The due date for quotations, Friday, January 12, 2007, remains unchanged by reason of this amendment.

QUESTIONS
1. Are there any specific times and days that deliveries are accepted at NIST?

2.  Are there any security measures that may affect this delivery?

RESPONSES
Deliveries are normally done during the week, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 0600 and 1700.  

The general procedure is for the delivery driver drive up to the gate and provide the NIST Police Officer the delivery paperwork.  The Officer will let the driver on site.  

Sometimes the Police will perform an inspection of the truck
looking for bombs or other prohibited items. 

Should a delivery be required outside of these hours, special arrangements would be made.  This would be handled on a case-by-case basis.

In the event NIST would go into a heightened state of emergency condition, documentation on the delivery driver's name, and country of citizenship would be required.  This too, would be handled on a case-by-case basis.
