<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 334516 with size standard of500 employees.

The Governments estimated expected delivery date is 2-4 weeks after receipt of the purchase order.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, has determined that the sole /single source reference is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein.

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) National Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC)  intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Biotage, Inc., 1725 Discovery Drive, Charlottesville, Va 22911, to purchase an (1) Initiator 60 Exp Microwave System and (2) Initiator 60 installation and training.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the equipment is manufactured by Biotage, Inc.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Small Business Utilization: Complexity and Extent of Small Business Utilization<BR><BR>d.	Cost<BR><BR>Contract Type:<BR>Any contract awarded will be a cost-plus-award-fee-type contract.<BR><BR>Organizational Conflict of Interest:<BR>It has been determined that the solicitation for the DMC mission will contain a detailed provision regarding Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) which will also be included in any resultant contract award.  A summary of the provision is outlined below: <BR><BR>a.  Definitions:  <BR><BR>Organizational Conflict of Interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.  Person as used herein includes corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and other business enterprises. <BR>	<BR>The term contractor as used, includes any person, firm, or corporation that has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor or in any parent corporation thereof, any person, firm, or corporation in or as to which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest.  The term also includes the corporate officers of the contractor, those of any corporation that has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor, and those of any corporation in which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest.  All references to the contractor as contained shall apply with equal force to all of these included.<BR><BR>Contract shall be used as applicable to the level at which this clause is being invoked.<BR><BR>b.  Exclusions: <BR><BR>In order to prevent a future OCI resulting from potential bias, unfair competitive advantage, or impaired objectivity, the contractor awarded the DMC contract shall be subject to the following restrictions:<BR><BR>	(1) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract for which, in the course of performance of this contract, the contractor has received advance procurement information before such information has been made generally available to other persons or firms.<BR><BR>	(2) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract for which the contractor assists in the development of workload and budgetary information or determining or validating program requirements.<BR><BR>	(3) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for or award of any Government contract that calls for the evaluation of system requirements, system definitions, or other products developed by the contractor under this contract. <BR><BR>	(4) The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract that requires the construction or fabrication of any system, equipment, hardware, and/or software for which the contractor participated in the development of requirements or definitions pursuant to this contract <BR><BR>    	(5)  The contractor shall be excluded from competition for, or award of any Government contract, that involves workload when the contractor has had the potential to influence or have advance knowledge of workload direction. <BR><BR>The exclusions contained in this clause shall apply for the duration of this contract and for three (3) years after completion and acceptance of all work performed hereunder.<BR><BR>If any provision of this clause excludes the contractor from competition for, or award of any contract, the contractor shall not be permitted to serve as a subcontractor, at any tier, on such contract. This clause shall be incorporated into any subcontract or consultant agreement awarded under this contract unless the Contracting Officer determines otherwise.<BR><BR>c.  Compliance:  <BR><BR>Compliance with this OCI requirements is a material obligation of this contract.  The rights and remedies described herein shall not be exclusive and are in addition to other rights and remedies provided by law, including those set forth at FAR Part 9.5, or elsewhere included in this contract.  If the contractor takes any action prohibited by this requirement or fails to take action required by this requirement, the Government may terminate this contract for default.  For breach of any of the restrictions contained herein, or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, the Government reserves the right to terminate this contract for default, disqualify the contractor for subsequent related contractual efforts, and to pursue such other remedies as may be available under law.  If in compliance with this clause, the contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest subsequent to contract award, the Contracting Officer may choose to terminate this contract for convenience of the Government, when such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.<BR><BR>d.  Avoidance of OCI: <BR><BR>The policy of the government is to avoid contracting with contractors who have unacceptable organizational conflicts of interest.  <BR><BR>It is not the intention of the government to foreclose a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI.  The Contracting Officer must evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances.  The final determination of such action may be negotiated between the impaired vendor and the Contracting Officer.  <BR><BR>The Contracting Officers decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and the efficacy of any proposed mitigation shall be final.<BR><BR>e.	Mitigation Plans:  <BR><BR>The successful contractor will be required to permit a government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for verification purposes.  The government reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is not in the best interests of the government. Additionally, after award the government will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed, in the event of changes in the vendor community due to mergers, consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest.<BR><BR>Contact Info:<BR>If after reviewing this synopsis, you are interested in this requirement, please send an email notice to melissa.light@us.army.mil stating your companys interest.<BR>Thank you.<BR>

<DESC>The USACE Vicksburg District intends to modify Contract No. W912EE-07-D-0003 with ABMB Engineers, Inc., to increase the contract value by $500,000 on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS under authority provided by 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Miscellaneous Design Support Services Performed on Projects Primarily within the Boundaries or Assignments of the Vicksburg District, Vicksburg, Mississippi, but may be within the Mississippi Valley Division or Other Missions of the Vicksburg District of the USACE.  Currently the contract has a value of $3 million with a Base Year and two Option Periods.  Design and preparation of construction plans and specifications for the initial phase of a multi-phase project for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Centers (ERDC) Information Technology Laboratory and Department of Public Works in Vicksburg, MS, has been completed (Building Phase 1 - a 10,000 square foot computer facility building requiring tilt-up construction); design work is also underway for an additional phase (connecting internal access roadway); and the added contract value will provide for the final design phase (Building Phase 2 - a second 10,000 square foot computer facility building requiring tilt-up construction and 55,000 square foot office building addition).  The Vicksburg District has determined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying Vicksburg Districts requirements may contact Ms. Jeri McGuffie at 601-631-5357 for additional information.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a solicitation (Request for Proposals) for warehouse and logistics services under an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The purpose of this RFP is to obtain warehouse services for USAID Title II Food Aid Pre-position program commodities.  Such commodities will consist of packaged agricultural products to be used to respond to humanitarian emergencies worldwide, with an emphasis on the Horn of Africa.  This RFP will seek proposals for warehouse services at one or more locations within each of the five regions specified below.  Contractor will be required to provide warehouse space at the offered warehouse locations upon request by USAID.  However, contractor need not maintain open warehouse space when not required by the USAID food aid program.  Contractor will be required to have warehouse space available in any/all proposed warehouse locations at the request of USAID with 30-day notice.  It is anticipated that two locations will be maintained throughout the duration of the contract, although USAID may require greater or fewer warehouse locations be opened as program requirements dictate.  USAID anticipates one warehouse location in the United States Gulf Coast region; and one near the Horn of Africa with preference for Djibouti.  Other proposed warehouse locations should be based on historical data of Food for Peace responses to emergency food aid requirements, which will be included in the RFP.  Warehouses will be maintained on behalf of USAID for a required period of time.  At the end of the required time period, USAID will request that the warehouse(s) services cease at that location.

Regions:
Horn of Africa: Supporting areas from Algeria to Somalia
Central and Southern Africa: Supporting areas from Kenya to South Africa
South East Asia: Supporting areas from Afghanistan to Japan
West Africa: Supporting areas from Northern Mauritania to Angola
United States Gulf Area: Supporting areas from Central America to the Caribbean

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) Only.   NAICS 333611
The Bureau of Reclamation, Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee Washington, is considering replacing the shaft seals in the Third Power Plant, on units G22-G24, 700 MW hydro-electric turbines.  These seals extend between the head cover plate in the turbine pit and the turbine shaft, preventing river water from flowing into the turbine pit.  The existing shaft seals consist of a braided rope packing box design.  The Government is considering replacing the rope packing box seal system with a face-type, multi-segmented mechanical seal system.  The new seals must hold leakage to less than 100 GPM.
The turbines are 960,000 hp Francis-type turbines, designed by Allis-Chalmers, 1977-1978.  The operating conditions are as follows:  85.7 rpm, clockwise, 160 rpm overspeed; centerline of turbine EL 946, center of packing box EL 950; shaft runout, up to 0.100 inch; 11.0 foot diameter shaft, shaft is internally flanged and bolted; head range, 220 to 360 feet, tailwater varies between EL 958 and EL 1011 (flood); runner throat diameter of 32 feet; turbine operates in condense mode, compressed air is injected through the headcover (80 psi) to blow down the water.  Drawings are available for review.
Please provide any additional information needed to prepare for the manufacturing of the seals with your response to this RFI. 
Interested parties may request drawings by faxing their company name, contact person's name, physical address, phone number, fax number, DUNs number, and TIN to Caroline Walsh, fax 509-633-9175.
Those parties responding to this RFI are asked to provide documentation on technical capability and expertise, characteristics of the mechanical seal proposed, estimated manufacturing time and estimated cost per seal for three (3) seals.  Responses to this RFI are requested no later than 02/25/09 by close of business, 5:00 PST.
Responses may be mailed to: Bureau of Reclamation, Attn: Caroline Walsh, PO Box 620, Grand Coulee, WA, 99133 or may be delivered by Federal Express to Bureau of Relcamation, Attn: Caroline Walsh, WHSE B Door 6 IND Area, Grand Coulee, WA, 99133.
Responses to the RFI will be evaluated for technical competencies and expertise, estimated manufacturering time, and the availability of the seals being manufacturered in the industrial commerical marketplace.  The evaluation of the RFI will allow the Government to determine whether there will be a resulting solicitation for acquisition.
Please address all questions concerning this Request For Information in writing to Caroline Walsh, 509-633-9175.

<SUBJECT>Chemical imaging system based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) scheme
<SOLNBR>AMD-09-SS12
<RESPDATE>021309
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement to perform mass spectrometric chemical imaging at atmospheric pressure.  Specifically, NIST is requesting information on a chemical imaging system based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) scheme.  This scheme should be fully adapted to operate at atmospheric pressure and be fully integrated with an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex 4000 QTrap atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer (API-MS), in terms of both hardware and software.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.


NIST needs an atmospheric pressure-based, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) system that meets or exceeds the following requirements:

	The atmospheric pressure, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (AP-MALDI) system must be fully integrated with an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex 4000 QTrap atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer (API-MS), in terms of both hardware and software.
	The AP-MALDI system software must directly acquire mass spectrometric information via the 4000 QTrap data acquisition system, and be capable of chemically mapping the acquired mass spectrometric data in two dimensions (x vs. y).  Strongest consideration will be given to systems where sample manipulation capabilities in the z-axis are in addition to x- and y-axis movement.
	The AP-MALDI system must connect to the 4000 QTrap via the Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex nanospray interface.
	All necessary components must come with the AP-MALDI system, including, but not limited to, a Nd:YAG laser, sample plate/stage(s), focusing system, sample stage manipulation control, all pertinent electrical connections/cables, all pertinent software (including media), and all pertinent hardware (including mount to the nanospray interface).
	AP-MALDI system software must be compatible with the Microsoft Windows XP OS to display, analyze, and record data, and must be capable of operating with the latest security patches and service pack updates from Microsoft.  
	The supplier of the instrument must have a proven record of reliability and experience in the area proposed, which in this case will apply to engineering and selling AP-MALDI systems that meet the requirements noted above, with particular attention give to the proven connectivity and reliability with Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex 4000 Series mass spectrometers.
	Delivery must be made to NIST within 30 days after the award.  The supplier shall schedule and facilitate instrument training that provides a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data collection and manipulation, and basic troubleshooting for multiple NIST scientists. This training shall continue for as many days as needed to ensure that each NIST scientist can acquire and manipulate data for all equipment modes, as well as perform basic maintenance and troubleshooting duties.  
	Price must include unlimited telephone support for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture a system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each system for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

The precursor chemical used in the Benzinger process is 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB) and a survey of industry to identify sources of this material is also being conducted.  As an indicator of your qualifications, a respondent to this market survey must be able to demonstrate that they have adequate technical and manufacturing capacity, and acceptable past performance, in the processing of TATB and TCB and/or similar explosive/chemical material(s).  Interested companies who feel that they have the necessary capabilities or have interest in establishing these capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information within the time-frame as established above:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities; description of facilities, personnel and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities with associated prices and lead-times; whether TATB using the Benzinger process is currently in production or when last produced; other explosive material(s) produced; and the minimum procurement quantity (MPC) required for production.  If a respondent does not currently have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent is requested to provide the estimated time and cost to establish this capability.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub tier sources or subcontractor for precursor materials, it is requested that these source be identified.  A respondents available production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture/supply TATB at annual quantity of 15,000  20,000 lbs.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) Joint Munitions & Lethality LifeCycle Management Command in support of the 40mm NL Ammunition Engineeringbranch at Picatinnys Armament Research, Development and Engineering Centeris investigating the use of pressure sensor mapping technology to assess the non-lethality of 40mm NL projectiles.  This investigation consists of shooting a NL projectile into the sensor surface that is backed with a soft resilient material and obtaining pressure vs. time and area vs. time maps in a digital output format.  The sensor shall be able to survive repeated low velocity impacts of various projectile profiles, operate in temperature extremes, and high humidity environments.  The impacts will range in magnitude from 0  1000 psi and possibly higher.  The sensor must be capable of obtaining pressure data with an accuracy of plus/minus 1 psi.  Respondents must be capable of providing the sensor system and training in the proper use of the sensor and any associated software programs.  This market survey is intended to find suitable technology to replace the clay block test (NIJ-STD 0101.04) in the evaluation and qualification of non-lethal munitions (M1006, M1012, M1013 and M1029).  This sensor will be used to evaluate the performance of kineticenergy non-lethal rounds in development as well. All interested sources are encouraged to electronically submit their capabilities data in regard to the above no later than March 2, 2009 to the following POC: roger.tang@us.army.mil.  All submittals should include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of contact, and brochures/literature.  In addition, it is requested that interested firms indicate their business size status (Large/Small).  Potential candidates should adequately describe their experience in pressure mapping technology. This announcement is for informational planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal, nor does it obligate the Government to issue a Request for Proposal.  Please be advisedthat the Government will not pay for any information submitted under his announcement.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of he results of this survey.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis   This is not a Notice of Solicitation.     The Walla Walla District is issuing this notice to determine if there are any sources capable of providing this study without compromising prior testing results and at a competitive price to the prior studies performed by Oregon State University. (O.S.U.).  Years of prior research have been already completed by O.S.U. and future results could be compromised if the follow on work is not exact to earlier test conditions set up by O.S.U.  For this and the following reasons, the Corps of Engineers intends to sole source this to Oregon State University based on statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for requirement under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The following provides the particulars:<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, CENWW, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, WA 99362, intends to issue a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price Base plus three option Periods award to OSU-Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit to provide continuing ongoing work to evaluate the impacts of Avian Predation on Salmonid Smolts from the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Under the National Marine Fisheries Service<BR>(NMFS) 2008 BiOP for the Operation of the Columbia River Power System, Predation Management Strategy 2, RPA#47; the Corps of Engineers has an obligation to provide the region with information on the impacts of predation on juvenile salmonids and whether management actions are warranted. The installation of new spillway passage weirs on the Snake River, delayed start of juvenile fish ,transportation programs, will likely increase the impacts of avian predation on juvenile salmonids; particularly selective predation on steelhead. The OSU-Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit has been conducting this research since 1997 and is a sole source that has developed specific knowledge of PIT tag deposition rates on Crescent and Foundation Islands, cormorant social attraction methods, Caspian tern and cormorant monitoring techniques, cormorant nesting platforms, PIT tag recovery techniques, bio-energetic modeling, stock-specific predation rate analysis, PIT tag detection efficiency methodology, PIT tag deposition rates, kleptoparasitism rates, and smolt vulnerability analysis. This study is ongoing and it is essential to maintain study continuity. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), and implemented by FAR 6.302-l(a)(2), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. .<BR><BR>CONTRACTOR SERVICES: <BR>Purpose:  Evaluate the impact of avian predation on salmonid smolts from Caspian terns on Crescent Island and Double-crested cormorants on Foundation Island located below the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers.  The long term goal for Crescent Island Caspian terns and Foundation Island cormorants is to determine the impact of predation on juvenile salmonids under a variety of system operations and help determine if land management actions are warranted.  Based on information resulting from this contract, the Corps plans to develop and implement an avian management plan for Corps owned lands, including avian colonies on Crescent Island, and associated shallow-water habitat. The primary objective of this plan will be to improve Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed anadromous fish survival for fish rearing and migrating through the lower Snake and Columbia rivers.  <BR><BR>Objectives: <BR>"	Research, monitor, and evaluate predation on salmonid smolts by Caspian terns, and Double-crested cormorants; and to a lesser degree, other piscivorous waterbirds, on the Columbia Plateau.  Determine colony size, habitat use, nesting success and factors limiting colony size and nesting success of the Caspian tern colony on Crescent Island and the Double-crested Cormorant colony on Foundation Island. Calculate 95% confidence limits for the estimate of the number of breeding pairs.  Determine gull kleptoparasitism rates on terns, disturbance rates to the tern colony, predation rates on tern nests, and other causes of tern nesting failure in order to evaluate those factors that limit nesting success at the Crescent Island Caspian tern colony.  <BR><BR>"	Determine diet composition and consumption of juvenile salmonids by Caspian terns nesting on Crescent Island and the Double-crested Cormorant colony on Foundation Island. Determine taxonomic composition of the diet of Caspian terns nesting on Crescent Island and the Double-crested Cormorant colony on Foundation Island.  Identify prey salmonid species as salmon or steelhead and estimate annual smolt consumption for the Crescent Island Caspian tern colony and the Double-crested Cormorant colony on Foundation Island using the bio-energetic modeling approach (95% confidence intervals will be calculated for estimates of smolt consumption by terns).<BR><BR>"	Determine species and stock-specific predation rates on juvenile salmonids from the Snake and Columbia rivers by Caspian terns nesting on Crescent Island and the Double-crested Cormorant colony on Foundation Island using derived estimates from bio-energetic modeling and PIT tags recovered from the island. Detect and recover PIT tags from the Crescent Island tern colony using previously established methods to estimate PIT tag detection efficiency and deposition rates in order to determine species and stock specific predation rates (95% confidence intervals will be calculated for estimates of predation by terns).  Measure PIT tag detection efficiency using previously establish methodology.  On Foundation Island, the Contractor shall construct nesting platforms and encourage cormorant nesting on the platforms to enhance the ability to detect PIT tags egested by nesting cormorant colony on Foundation Island.  Detect PIT tags at selected gull and other piscivorous waterbirds colonies as a means to evaluate relative and species and stock-specific (where feasible) predation rates on juvenile on juvenile salmonids.  Detection efficiency estimates will be calculated relative to the sowing date and plot, thereby describing both temporal and spatial variation in detection efficiency.  <BR><BR>"	Determine predation rates and total annual and seasonal fish consumption of Snake River wild steelhead and wild Chinook using PIT tags recoveries for year 2005-2009.  Methodology shall be developed in collaboration with NMFS<BR><BR>"	Determine how various biotic and abiotic factors are associated with differences in smolt vulnerability to predation on Snake River steelhead by Crescent Island Caspian terns, Foundation Island cormorants, and other piscivorous waterbird colonies.  Evaluate fish pathology and whole body chemistry of sub-sampled steelhead as a measure of fish health using established protocol.  Investigate how abiotic factors are associated with differences in smolt vulnerability to predation by birds; factors include temperature, inflow, outflow, spill levels, spill duration, and turbidity.  Determine differences in predation rates associated with fish length, weight, condition, origin, abundance, and release date.  Contractor will continue to work collaboratively with NOAA Fisheries to utilize existing and future telemetry data from tags collected on Crescent and Foundation Islands. Data acquired recovery of acoustic and radio tags may be sufficient to determine whether smolt travel times, migration behavior, and passage histories are associated with vulnerability to predation.<BR><BR>"	Detect the formation of new Caspian tern colonies and new double-crested cormorant colonies on the Columbia Plateau and investigate colony size, habitat use, nesting success and factors limiting colony size and nesting success of incipient tern and cormorant colonies. Surveys shall be conduct to determine the distribution and size of double-crested cormorant colonies on the mid-Columbia River (from the Dalles Dam to the head of Wanapum pool) and on the lower Snake River (from the mouth of the Clearwater River to the confluence with the Columbia River), as well as at sites off the Columbia and Snake rivers that are within foraging range of cormorants.<BR><BR>"	For Caspian terns, asses the inter-colony movements, survival, and average age of first reproduction of terns banded at breeding colonies through out the western United States. Assess the relationship between management related changes in the size and productivity of colonies in the Columbia River estuary and changes in recruitment and reproductive success at colonies on the Columbia Plateau.<BR><BR>"	For Double-crested cormorants determine the distribution, relative abundance, and diet composition of cormorants along the mid-Columbia River and lower Snake River up to the confluence of the Clearwater River and Snake River during the post breeding season to assess the impacts of predation by over-wintering cormorants on residual fall Chinook salmon. <BR><BR><BR>PROFESSIONAL SKILLS:  Changes on to Dam and juvenile fish transport program operations may change the impacts of avian predation on juvenile salmonids; particularly selective predation on steelhead. The ability to determine the impact of avian predation on juvenile salmonids from Caspian terns and cormorants require specific techniques and methodologies, analysis procedures, and equipment in order to maintain continuity of data and regional acceptability of the work.  This work includes specific knowledge of PIT tag deposition rates on Crescent and Foundation Islands, cormorant social attraction methods, Caspian tern and cormorant monitoring techniques, cormorant nesting platforms, PIT tag recovery techniques, bio-energetic modeling, stock-specific predation rate analysis, PIT tag detection efficiency methodology, PIT tag deposition rates, kleptoparasitism rates, and smolt vulnerability analysis.<BR><BR>CONDITIONS:  <BR>a. Equipment: All non-expendable equipment purchased under this work order will remain the property of the Corps. <BR>b. Endangered Species Act (ESA) Permits: Unless otherwise approved by the Corps, prior to initiating work under the terms of this Memorandum of Agreement it is the responsibility of Contractor to obtain any permits which may be required by the ESA, 16U.S.C. Section 1531 et. seq. In the event such a permit is denied for the research work contemplated by this agreement, the Corps may terminate this work order in whole or part. <BR>c. Fish Handling: All handling of ESA listed species must conform to the Conditions Related in the NMFS Biological Opinion (2008).<BR><BR>ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION: The solicitation will be available on the FedTeDS website: https://www.fedteds.gov The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a Size Standard of$6.5. This is not a request for bids, but notice that our intent to issue a Sole Source solicitation for this requirement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.<BR><BR>The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of SUCTION CATHETERS AND YANKAUER INSTRUMENTS. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  Point of Contact:  Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil.<BR>  <BR><BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of SUCTION CATHETERS AND YANKAUER INSTRUMENTS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $26,335.24. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) FLORIA.JONES@US.ARMY.MIL.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Floria.Jones@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Suction Catheter and Yankauer Instrument products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.   <BR>a.	At a minimum a complete product line includes:  Sterile disposable/single use Suction Catheters and Yankauer Instruments.  Suction Catheters MUST be available with and without (control vents and graduated depth markings).  Catheters MUST be provided in a wide range of French sizes (5 FR, 6 FR, 8 FR, 10 FR, 12 FR, 14 FR, 16 FR and 18 FR) with catheters packaged as (loop, coil and straight).  Yankauer Instruments MUST be provided with (tapered bulbous tip, bulbous tip and straight tip); available with and without (control vents and pre-attached suction tubing). Catheters and Yankauer Instruments MUST be latex safe/free.<BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for Suction Catheters and Yankauer Instruments product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Suction Catheters and Yankauer Instruments in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Suction Catheters and Yankauer Instrument products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) attention at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale.   A one to five scoring range will be used to rate the sample products.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical / non-patient care setting. <BR>    <BR>The following Clinical /Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Suction Catheters<BR><BR>1.	(Patient Safety Goal 16  Improve recognition and response to changes in a patients condition) ___Suction catheter tip opening is adequate for sufficient removal of secretions.<BR>a.	Congested /obstructed breathing requires adequate removal of secretions from patients airway to prevent respiratory blockage.<BR>b.	Clinician will visually inspect the catheter tip opening using gloved hands attach catheter to operational suction equipment and perform suction procedure observing secretion removal and will listen to patients airway and chest for clear breath sounds after suctioning.<BR>2.	 (Patient Safety Goal 16- Improve recognition and response to changes in a patients condition) ___Suction catheter has control vent that is responsive to Clinicians manipulation.<BR>a.   Catheter with a responsive control vent allows the Clinician to regulate suction    pressure required to remove secretions from airway to prevent air way obstruction.<BR> b. Evaluator will suction patient using control vent as needed to increase vacuum pressure to clear patients airway while observing control vent response to manipulation.<BR><BR>Yankauer Instrument<BR><BR>3.	(Patient safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk for healthcare associated infection)____Yankauer     suction tip opening is large enough to allow thick liquid and particles to pass. <BR>a.	 Suction tip opening must be large enough to remove particles and/ or thick liquid from the patients air way to prevent aspiration of unwanted material into the lungs that may cause pneumonia.<BR>b.	The evaluator will observe the suction efficiency by attaching the Yankauer device to an operational vacuum system and suction a known thick liquid with particles from a container to determine if suction tip opening can remove particles and thick liquids.<BR>4.	(Patient Safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk for Healthcare associated infection) ____Yankauer suction has a bulbous tip configuration.<BR>        a.   The bulbous tip openings are positioned to prevent pulling to soft mucosal tissue causing irritation which can create an area for infection<BR>         b.   Evaluator will establish suction using the bulbous tip Yankauer, using a thin layer of gauze; adjust the vacuum system to create high suction pressure while placing the suction tip near and against the gauze. Evaluator will observe the bulbous tip for grabbing or pulling the gauze<BR>Pricing Analysis Process:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified /invited to provided their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region, (Post-Standardization Costs).  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 20 FEBRUARY 2009 5:00 PM EST.<BR>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture  Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) anticipates a sole source (name brand) procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following requirement: A Better World Plastic Multi-Lure trap.

The USDA-APHIS-PPQ-FMS uses a delimitation grid that relies on Mutli-Lure based traps and that have been proven effective at detecting male Medflies.  The Multi-Lure trap is also the approved trap for the Biolure bait.  Without this trap it will be difficult to 
maintain an effective survey to monitor the presence or absence of any other wild
Medflies within the release area. Failure to detect additional wild flies would seriously
compromise the integrity of the eradication effort and could ultimately either add to the
overall cost or even prevent its successful completion.

A Better Trap Inc. is the only manufacturer of this trap. The Multilure trap is patented in the United States and the patent number is US 6,532,695 B1 dated March 18, 2003.

The USDA anticipates a three year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract worth approximately $50,000.00 per year.

Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office.  Small business concerns are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive (i.e., non-brand name) procurement.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your Statement of Capability.   The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email Statements of Capability Nathan Johnson Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  Closing date for submission of Statements of Capability is Thursday, February 12th at 3:00 PM Central Standard Time.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 326199 with a small business size standard of less than 500 employees.

In order to prevent the migration of ACP, Mexico, the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service-International Services (USDA-APHIS-IS) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) will lead the effort through the  establishment of an ACP Pilot Program" to suppress insect populations in the States of Baja Mexico (California Norte). Phase I of the ACP Pilot Program will consist of preventing the migration of this insect vector into commercial citrus producing areas by providing foliar and soil applications of pesticides throughout the Baja municipality of Tijuana. Accordingly, given the potential of severe economic consequences to both governments should this disease be allowed to spread to unaffected areas, the USDA-APHIS-IS intends to award a sole source contract to Fumigadora Union, Servico De Garantia En Control De Plagas, Av. San Vicente # 20626, Buenos Aires Norte, Tijuana, Mexico to provide Phase I emergency foliar and soil applications of pesticides. This procurement will be conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-2 (Unusual and compelling urgency). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 115112, and the size standard is $7.0 million. Contract is firm fixed price. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these products to the Contracting Officer by 3:30 p.m. Central Time (CT) on Wednesday, February 11, 2009. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Responses received after the response date or without the required information will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Daniel M. Kline, Contracting Specialist, USDA-APHIS-MRPBS, ASD Procurement Branch, Butler Square Building, 5th Floor, 100 N. 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, or via email @ daniel.m.kline@aphis.usda.gov or fax @ (612) 336-3550.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) intends to award three (3) sole source service agreement contracts for support of laboratory equipment located in various state and USDA Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories (VDL) which together comprise the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN).  One of the primary missions for the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) in the event of an outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry. To meet this goal, the NAHLN has purchased certain laboratory equipment which has been distributed to participating state laboratories to increase their respective testing capacity. All of the equipment requires annual preventative maintenance, software upgrades, and emergency repair services. The equipment list is as follows:  Twenty-six (26) Biomek NXP units purchased from Beckman-Coulter, twenty (20) BioSprint96 units purchase from Qiagen, and twenty-three (23) ABI 7500 FAST units, purchased from Applied Biosystems. Each unit is located in a separate state VDL. Based on market research and past attempts at competition, USDA-APHIS has determined that there are no qualified laboratory equipment service providers that possess the capabilities to furnish the Governments requirements for annual preventive maintenance, software upgrades, and emergency repair services on the referenced equipment other than the listed Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). Accordingly, the procurements will be conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1, (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements). Contracts will all be firm fixed price. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $7.0 million. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its services, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these services, to the Contracting Officer by 3:30 p.m. Central Time (CT)  on Wednesday, February 11, 2009.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Biobased Document Protectors and Project Folders by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0889 Protector, Document, Biobased, Clear, 50/BX</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0890 Protector, Document, Biobased, Clear, 100/BX</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0891 Folders, Project, Biobased, Clear</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Biobased Document Protectors and Project Folders to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>C-Line 62607</p>
<p>C-Line 62627</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 12, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data. G</p>
<p>eneral information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to pursue a competitive Performance Based Logistics acquisition for future operations and sustainment support for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system and associated support facilities.  Anticipated acquisition will commence not later than fiscal year (FY) 2011.  The GMD Weapon System is a complex system of systems that consists of hardware and software, including Ground Based Interceptors (GBIs), GBI silos, and related flight and ground test equipment; Launch Site Components, Command Launch Equipment, and related Peculiar Support Equipment; the Re-locatable In-Flight Interceptor Communications System (IFICS) Data Terminal (IDT); and tactical/non-tactical communications equipment and support facilities that are geographically dispersed across the globe.  The principal locations of GMD program performance are MDA and contractor operated facilities located at Huntsville, Alabama; Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado; Vandenberg Air Force Base, California; and Fort Greely, Alaska.  MDA in Huntsville, Alabama, is the contracting activity.  As a part of this acquisition-planning process, MDA intends to engage industry in a variety of forums including site visits, industry days, one-on-one meetings, and other opportunities to assist the government in refining a Performance Based Logistics construct for the GMD system.  The acquisition will have an anticipated length of 5 to 10 years with a period of performance that begins in FY 2011.  The acquisition will have an approximate annual value of $200 million at award.

<DESC><p><strong>Motorola is an Industry Leader in Communications Systems. GSA currently utilizes a Motorola radio system at 170 Federal Plaza in Central Islip New York. At this location, there exists a Single Site Astro 25 System. Astro is Motorola's trade name for its proprietary digital radio communications technology platform which addresses the APCO 25 public safety industry standards. These standards were developed by APCO. APCO (which is an acronym for Association of Public Safety Communications Officers) is an independent committee comprised of Police and Public Safety agencies across the United States. Project 25 is the specific standard developed by APCO to address spectrum efficiency, digital migration path and encryption in the Public Safety market. This standard has come to be known within the industry as APCO 25. The Federal Government has adopted this APCO 25 Standard and has become a requirement for DHS, FPS and other agencies as a result of the post 911 security standards. At the bottom of this special notice, you will find an outline which has been copied and pasted off the APCO Web site. It outlines the APCO 25 Standard.<br />At the time of purchase of the radio system at 170 Federal Plaza, this site was designed as the first phase for a Multi Site Astro Simulcast System that would cover GSA's area of operation and comply with DHS and FPS APCO 25 requirements. The current project is to add two additional sites and integrate these sites with the existing equipment to create an ASTRO 25 Simulcast System. The additional equipment must be compatible with the existing Motorola ASTRO 25 Simulcast equipment to allow for a seamless integration. Motorola is the only manufacturer that can provide the equipment necessary to migrate the existing equipment into an ASTRO Simulcast System. <br />At times, Motorola utilizes Independent Resellers to distribute their product. Motorola reserves the right determine the distribution method on all opportunities. Motorola is the only company that has knowledge of the current system which has been specifically designed and engineered for GSA with its prime site located at 170 Federal Plaza in Central Islip. Due to the complexities involved with the integration of the Phase II equipment (to be installed at the Addabbo Site in Jamaica and the Holtsville Site in Suffolk) into the existing Motorola System, GSA requests that your firm submit a statement of capability. &nbsp;This is the only way for Motorola to assure proper system integration in compliance with APCO 25 standards which will meet GSA's expectations.<br /></strong></p>

No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated items is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated items.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at:  USAMRAA, ATTN:  MCMR-AAA-P (Jodi Cardoza), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.<BR><BR>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition Justification<BR><BR>1.	Contracting Activity:  The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity.<BR><BR>2.  Description of Action:  This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed price contract using R&D Fiscal Year 2008 funds.<BR><BR>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC) has the requirement to obtain 30 TaqMan 1000 RXN Gold with Buffer A Packs part number 4304441 and 65 GeneAmp dNTP s with dUTP kits part number N8080095 from Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI) in support of national security in the NBFAC Molecular Biology Laboratories.<BR><BR>4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  While there are other vendors that offer comparable reagents for Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), the NBFACs Molecular Biology Department has validated and verified these reagents manufactured by Applied Biosystems Inc. for use within their ISO 17025 accredited assays. Using different reagents within the ISO 17025 accredited assays would stop the NBFACs ability to perform work in accordance with their ISO 17025 accredited program, ultimately inhibiting the NBFAC from delivering ISO 17025 accredited results to their customer.  Maintaining and adhering to their ISO 17025 accredited program is a requirement of the NBFACs customer.  <BR><BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  No efforts will be taken to obtain competition as a delay in performance of casework could occur if a new vendors reagents are to be used.<BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Increasing competition is not possible at this time.  <BR><BR>8.  Market Research:  Market research was performed by Christina Pfotenhauer in November 2008, which revealed USB, a component of Affymetrix Inc., markets dNTPs with dUTP for the same price as ABI.  This would not have any cost savings and there could still be a delay in performance of casework to allow time to verify these reagents work for NBFACs Molecular Biology Assays.<BR><BR>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have written to express interest in this requirement.  The notice required by FAR 5.201 shall be published and any bids or proposals received shall be considered.<BR><BR>10.	Other facts:  <BR>a.	Procurement history.  Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from the computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are expected:<BR><BR>i.	Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards. These items were not previously purchased via a sole source.<BR>ii.	Competitive status of these actions.  --Not applicable<BR>iii.	Authority previously used for less than full and open competition. --Not applicable.<BR>iv.	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.  --This is not applicable as there have been no sole source justifications written for previous procurement actions.<BR>v.	If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, detailed explanation of the change circumstances. --Not applicable.<BR>vi.	An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive urgent buys.  --Not applicable.<BR>vii.	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes.  --Not applicable.<BR>b.	Acquisition data availability.   No statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition has been developed.<BR><BR>c.	Unusual compelling urgency.  Not applicable.<BR><BR>Subcontracting competition:  Not applicable<BR>

STATEMENT OF WORK

Rapid Biodiversity Assessment (RBA) for Malagarasi Hydropower Project at Igamba Falls


1.	INTRODUCTION

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation under Title VI of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriation Act, 2004.   The MCC has a requirement for a Rapid Biodiversity Assessment (RBA) Contractor to conduct an assessment of the Malagarasi Hydropower Project described in Annex I of the Tanzania Compact at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/compact-tanzania.pdf.


After Compact signing, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) discovered that in 2005, a group of scientists led by Dr. Ellinor Michel of the Natural History Museum, London, had conducted a biodiversity study of the Malagarasi River, including Igamba Falls. 

As a result of the study, several new aquatic species were discovered, some of which are believed to be endemic to the Igamba Falls area, namely two fish species (a catfish and a cichlid), and a snail. To date, key ecological and biological information on these species, (i.e. degree of endemism, genetics, lifecycle/reproduction, habitat, predator-prey relations and feeding ecology) is poorly understood. The Millennium Challenge Account-Tanzania (MCA-T), a Government of Tanzania (GoT) agency tasked to execute the Compact, has contracted with a consulting engineer for the energy sector (ESB International, or ESBI) whose contract includes conducting a baseline survey at Igamba Falls and producing a Comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (CESIA) of the investment; however the scope and skills required to answer key biodiversity questions raised as a result of Dr. Michels study are beyond the scope of the ESBI contract and require specialized expertise.

Therefore, MCC would like to enhance and supplement ESBIs work through procurement of a RBA to collect key data in and around Igamba Falls, in order to help answer questions regarding population distribution. Fieldwork will center on identifying whether the target species exist in other areas of the Malagarasi basin and gaining an understanding of the relative importance of the Igamba population if found elsewhere.

2.	BACKGROUND

The United States of America, acting through MCC, and the GoT signed a Millennium Challenge Compact in February 2008, which sets forth the general terms and conditions on which MCC will provide funding of up to $698 million to the GoT. The Program, which comprises projects in the Transport, Energy and Water sectors aims to reduce poverty through economic growth by increasing productivity and raising incomes.

The Energy project includes the proposed construction of a small run-of-river hydro power plant on the Malagarasi River to supply affordable and reliable electricity to Kigoma and surrounding towns of Kasulu and Uvinza. The proposed project will involve the construction of an 8MW hydropower power plant at Igamba Falls, and is part of an overall scheme known as Igamba Falls Stages I, II and III, planned to generate a total of 24 MW of electrical power. The MCC-funded portion is Stage II. (See Annex I of the Compact at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/compact-tanzania.pdf .

As with all MCC Compacts, the Tanzania Compact has a five-year time constraint for completion.  Thus, because all of the investments must be completed by September 2013, there is a significant time constraint in executing the Malagarasi Hydro-power investment.  For this reason, MCC plans to make a go/no-go decision on whether or not to provide funding for the Malagarasi investment by July 2009 (the date by which bidding documents for construction would need to be released in order to complete the project by 2013).  Consequently, the work envisaged under this SOW needs to be completed as soon as possible to provide decision makers with sufficient information for making an informed decision about the future of the investment.

3.	SCOPE of WORK

MCC requires an RBA assessment that is inclusive of a biological survey designed to generate scientific information in a short period of time, focusing on those species identified in Dr. Michels report as endemic to Igamba (target species), to help MCC reach an informed decision on how to move forward with the Malagarasi Hydropower Project ..



4.0	TASKS
The Contractor shall assemble a team of well-qualified scientists, recognized experts in their disciplines, to produce a rapid assessment of the distribution of the target species.  This should be accomplished by conducting sampling at both Igamba Falls as well as other areas within and around the Malagarasi basin with similar micro-ecosystems where the species identified at Igamba may also be found. The combined knowledge of the experts should allow them to assess in a three- to four-week survey period the endemism of species at Igamba Falls and report to MCC on their findings. 

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

4.1	Assemble the key personnel identified in this Statement of Work, including recognized experts in the fields of ichthyology, malacology and freshwater ecosystems, to manage the literature review and consultations with scientists with experience in the Malagarasi area;
4.2	Conduct a thorough literature review and gap analysis, including consulting with Dr. Michel and her team, to further refine and focus the scope and location of field activities;
4.3	Consult with scientists in Washington, DC, Cornell University, Dar es Salaam and London, UK, as needed, to gather information, view specimens collected in 2005 and confer with original members of Dr. Michels team;
4.4	Recruit the remainder of the field team  experts in ichthyology, malacology, and freshwater ecosystems  as needed to complete sampling while in country.
4.5	Conduct sampling at Igamba Falls, focusing on those species identified in Dr. Michels report as possibly endemic to Igamba Falls; 
4.6	Conduct field work in other areas of the Malagarasi Basin or in other areas to be identified by the team of experts as having the potential to harbor such species; 
4.7	Consult, as needed, with the engineers and environmental staff of MCA-T and MCC (and their consultants) to better understand the potential changes in hydrology and hydraulic regime, water quality or other habitat changes associated with the project. 
4.8	Produce a written report that includes both the findings of the fieldwork as well as provides guidance about the possible impacts of the proposed hydropower project on populations of the target species.


5.0       PROJECT PHASES

5.1 Phase 1. Literature and Secondary Data Review 

Conduct a thorough review of existing reports and other literature, including the appended 2005 study report, and any subsequent papers published. The purpose of this step is to identify the extent of current knowledge and gaps concerning the target species (including any available initial assessments on the impact of the project on the lifecycle of species) and aid in the planning and refining of the field mission. A written synopsis of the results and conclusions of this review shall be submitted to the MCC.

5.2 Phase 2. Expert Consultation

Confer with members of Dr. Michels team in New York, London and Tanzania to view original specimens and gain a sense of what is currently known or assumed about the target species biology.  This activity shall be done concurrent with the literature review. If acceptable to the authors, the Contractor shall study any draft papers concerning the target species. The results of the literature review and expert consultations shall directly inform team selection as well as the Consultants guidance regarding the potential impacts of the investment.  In addition, the Consultant should engage in consultations with MCA-Ts and MCCs Engineers and Designers in order to gauge the effect of project development on the Igamba Falls habitat and its biodiversity, including the three potentially endemic species.  The Consultant should discuss with the project engineers and designers the potential changes in water quality (physical and biological characteristics), water flow volumes, peaks, lows, periodicity and seasonality, water storage/impoundment during construction and operation of the hydropower scheme to better understand how these changes could affects the Igamba ecosystem

5.3 Phase 3. Team Selection 

Recruit a field team of experts in ichthyology, malacology, hydrology, and other natural science/ecological fields as needed for the study subject to approval by MCC and concurrent with and relying heavily on information garnered through literature review and expert consultation.  CVs of prospective team members shall be submitted to MCC for approval.

5.4 Phase 4. Field Work

Conduct sampling operations at Igamba Falls and similar sites with suitable habitat based on information gathered during the previous phases. The purpose of this operation is to ascertain whether the target species exist elsewhere in the area. If found elsewhere, the team will also estimate their numbers so as to determine whether other viable populations exist and to what extent those populations are dependent on the Igamba Falls habitat. The assessment should also include observations and considered opinions and views (based on primary and secondary data analysis) on whether and how potential impacts of the proposed hydropower plant on the target species could be mitigated.

5.5 Preliminary Report

Submit a preliminary report of findings to MCC, no later than 15 days after returning from Tanzania. Submission of this report shall be followed in short order by a face-to-face meeting with MCC in Washington, DC, wherein the consultant will discuss the results of their findings, respond to questions and provide input on possible impacts and recommended mitigation.


5.6 Final Report
Submit a Final Report of the findings of the operation within 30 days of receipt of questions and comments from MCCs review of the Preliminary Report. The report shall include an assessment of the endemism of the species found at the Igamba Falls site, the relative importance of the Igamba Falls site to the viability of the populations of those species, potential impacts of the proposed hydropower project both during construction and operation on such parameters as minimum flow velocity, etc., as well as a preliminary discussion of possible impacts and available mitigation measures.

<CONTACT>Jisun Kang, Phone 951-413-2211, Email jisun.kang@dodmedia.osd.mil
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation with a notice of intent to issue an order to Omnitec Solutions, Inc, 6701 Democracy Blvd., Suite 300, Bethesda, MD 20817-1828, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The proposed procurement is to provide professional advisory assistance in establishing the immediate office of the Director of Defense Media Activity. Rationale for sole source: There is an immediate need for BRAC transition advisory and assistance services while the Defense Media Activity establishes Initial Operating Capability staff support. Procurement by Other than Full and Open Competition is necessary because the need for professional assistance is urgent, and Omnitec Solutions Inc. is prepared to immediately provide the support required with the personnel who have the level of expertise needed to successfully establish the required capabilities for a new Defense Field Activity, due to their ongoing effort in Advisory and Assistance Services for BRAC contract awarded on 31 Jan 06. This is a temporary requirement (90 days only) to maintain current capability for this support until a follow-on contract for the continued provision of these highly specialized services can be fully competed to award on new contract, and will no longer be required when a replacement contract capability is fully compted and awarded. This announcement constitutes the only notice; a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Quote (RFQ). A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
This order will include the following referenced clauses which may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov: Provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23 effective 26 Dec 2007 and DFARS Change Notice 20071207. (1)  FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items) (NOV 2007): (a) Re para (a):  NAICS 541611; small business size standard is $7.0 M. (b) Note that para (k) requires quoter to be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at time order is issued and throughout performance.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK-QUANTIFERON GOLD-IN-TUBE TESTING <br /><br />Scope of Work: <br /><br />The proposed study, entitled "Screening for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) in US Army Recruits" aims to assess the feasibility and potential impact of using a targeted testing approach and two interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), the Quantiferon Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT.TB, as an alternative to the universal application of the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) to identify latent TB infection (LTBI) among military recruits.</p>
<p><br />The Quantiferon-Gold-in-tube test is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease. The QFT-GIT Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) measures interferon-gamma released from lymphocytes in whole blood samples incubated with antigens to MTB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Earlier generations of the test have been used in the United States for several years, and this generation product was approved by the FDA for use in the US in October 2007. <br />Three additional milliliters (3 ml) of blood will be collected for QFT-GIT testing from each subject during the entry level medical examination. The set of three QFT-GIT tubes containing 1 ml of fresh blood will be incubated at 37o C at Fort Jackson by study personnel for 16 to 24 hours. Incubation will begin within 12 hours of collecting the blood. After incubation the tubes will be centrifuged for 5 minutes and stored at 2 to 8 o C until shipped cold via Federal Express or other contract carrier to the laboratory where the test will be completed. Only study ID number will be affixed to the sample, and will not include any identifying or other information.</p>
<p><br />To measure the inter-assay reproducibility of the QFT-GIT, 10% of the participants will have two samples collected at enrollment but tested in separate batches, and the results compared. <br />QFT-GIT results will not be used in clinical care of subjects. <br /><br />Tasks and Responsibilities: <br />o Provide fully qualified and proficient personnel and equipment <br />o Have the capacity to perform QFT-GIT testing for up to 2,750 specimens <br />o Meet the processing window listed in the package insert <br />o Prepare and maintain diagnostic reagents provided by USUHS. <br />o Provide proper preventive maintenance, calibration, operation and quality control of laboratory instruments and equipment necessary to obtain an accurate determination of laboratory procedure. <br />o Recognize any abnormal results obtained and promptly bring this information to the attention of the supervisor. <br />o Coordinate with study personnel at USAMEDDAC Ft. Jackson to addresses supply problems and issues related to sample labeling and receipt. <br />o Use software provided for analysis of QFT-GIT raw data and calculation of results. <br />o Submit final results to the Clinical Data Manager at the Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC). <br />o Coordinate with the Clinical Data Manager to resolve any data queries. <br />o Perform all Quality Control and Quality Assurance functions related to QFT-GIT testing <br />o Adhere to Good Clinical Laboratory practice <br />USUHS/IDCRP is responsible for:<br />o Obtain IRB approval <br />o Obtain and hold IND for Battey antigen <br />o Perform consent, questionnaires, blood draws, and skin test administration, reading and documentation on 2500 recruits (2750 specimens) <br />o Obtain QFT-GIT Tube Packs for obtaining specimens <br />o Obtain and provide QFT-GIT ELISA kits <br />o Provide software for analysis of QFT-GIT raw data and calculation of results <br />o Collect and handle specimens according to the QFT-GIT package insert. <br />o Perform initial processing of lab specimens, including incubation and centrifugation of specimens at USAMEDDAC Ft.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY  SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989)

The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule.  The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only.  The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary.  Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period.  The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both.  When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation.  A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided.  Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period.  To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option.  In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits.  The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period.  However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Disaster Operations Specialists (DOSs) play a central role in the U.S. Governments (USGs) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.

They manage portfolios consisting of one or several countries, and are members of regionally focused humanitarian response teams consisting of other DOSs, a Regional Coordinator, Information Officers, and Technical Specialists.

This team consists of five regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA), Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean (ASIA/LAC), Southern, Western and Northern Africa (SWAN), East and Central Africa (ECA) and Sudan.  Each regional group is managed by a Regional Coordinator.

In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p><br /><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT OVERVIEW (Original)</strong></p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Autonomous Space and Ground Systems for Space Superiority</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA_RV_08_02</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S): 12.800 AIR FORCE DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES PROGRAM and 12.910 RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: <strong>This is a 35 day Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for the United States Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Spacecraft Component Technology Branch</strong>, which is supporting the advanced decision support and autonomy efforts in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Command and Control (C2), and Defensive CounterSpace (DCS). The technologies developed under this solicitation will provide affordable and reliable solutions to enable the next generation of Air Force space systems. This effort will require access to classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN; therefore, foreign owned firms are precluded from submitting proposals. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards for contracts or assistance instruments using an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract for Task 1; it will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract's guaranteed minimum order requirement. The anticipated ordering period for individual award(s) resulting from this BAA is up to 48 months in duration with individual task order period of performance ranging from 18 - 48 months.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: This BAA will remain open for a period of 35 days from the date of publication. The due date for proposals submitted in response to this BAA is no later than 12:00 p.m. MST on 19 JANUARY 2009. Proposals received after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Anticipated funding for this BAA (not per contract or award) is: FY09-$1.5M; FY10-$1.5M; FY11-$1.4M; FY12-$1.0M. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unforeseen budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The applicable NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a size standard of 500. This acquisition is unrestricted and is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps/EPS http://www.fbo.gov and/or Grants.gov/FIND http://www.grants.gov in the event this announcement is amended. Due to past problems with posting notices to Grants.gov/FIND, offerors are advised to monitor both websites to ensure timely receipt of notifications.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype, grant, cooperative agreement, or OT for Research. The Air Force may also consider award of an appropriate technology transfer mechanism if applicable. Specific instructions for assistance awards are in paragraph 7 of this BAA. It is anticipated that award under this BAA will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) completion contract which requires successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding multiple contracts or assistance instruments. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make one award or no awards pursuant to this BAA.</p>

Limitation of competition under simplified acquisition procedures is permitted when justified by FAR 13.501.  RBP has identified the Motorola XTL 5000 03 Control Head because it is the only control head of it's size and weight that is compatible with special communications equipment used.  The Motorola XTL5000 mobile radio has direct day to day communications between E&E and EAC members abroad.  These radios are used in all types of climate areas around the world from humid, very hot, to extreme cold conditions.  Although Motorola makes a very good product, over a period of time with frequent usage, the control heads beigin to malfunction or just fail to operate for proper communications.  The control head that comes with the XTL5000 mobile only comes in kit form, thus the need to purchase spare control heads.  This product features all of the specifications required by the Radio Programs Branch, and provides maximum interoperability with equipment and procedures already in place.<BR><BR>

<DESC>UPDATE TO SOURCES-SOUGHT SYNOPSIS

We appreciate all interest in our recent request for information.  We want to be intelligent consumers and we want to be able to make prudent decisions about planning our approach.  For this reason, we included the following blurb in our posting:  Potential providers of audiovisual hardware for the two visitor centers and/or the production of movies for each site with options noted above are invited to identify themselves by submitting information and/or responses no more than four pages in length to the following items to help us understand such matters as (a) what capabilities exist in the marketplace to meet our needs; (b) whether the sequence of the RFPs (with hardware before production) is of critical importance; (c) how much detail is recommended for storyboards and written narration for the productions success; (d) whether our deadlines for outcomes are reasonable and doable; (e) thoughts on how the Forest Service might evaluate proposals to identify the best hardware and movie production solutions; (f) ideas and thoughts regarding the costs the Forest Service might be expected to pay; and (g) other information that might be helpful to the Forest Service as we determine our requirements and our approach to the acquisition.

We are most sincerely interested in receiving industry responses to these questions, written with the purpose of helping us be intelligent consumers in the hardware and production marketplaces.  

At this time, we are not prepared to talk to any one source about making commitments or purchases.  Were interested in learning.  Or in other words, we're seeking for knowledge and insight rather than specific solutions.  And for the time being, we prefer written information rather than telephone or face-to-face exchanges.  We intend to evaluate and understand the inputs you in industry will give to us and then to proceed to more definitive discussions and decisions in the future.

We hope this update will be helpful to you in understanding our needs.  If you have already sent us a response, and you want to re-do it in light of this update, feel free to do so.  If you havent responded yet, please let this update shape your response.
