<DESC>In support of RAF Alconbury, the government intends to award a contract for youth ministries services.  This is a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation. There will be no public bid opening. This is a Request for Proposal (RFP), Performance Price Trade-Off (PPTO) solicitation. Award will be based upon Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 15 and the terms in the solicitation. This will be awarded unrestricted. The NAICS code for this requirement is 812320.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  The entire solicitation, including the performance work statement, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package, and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and attachments, which should be on or about 14 August 2007.  Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://orca.bpn.gov/. Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g. agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.  Contractors are also advised that they must register with the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), or risk having their proposals declared non-responsive.

The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) Contracting (AFCEE/ACH), Brooks City-Base, Texas is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Post Closing Management requirement.  This is a major source selection for Advisory & Assistance Services (A&AS) in support of the AFCEE and its customers on DoD (primarily Air Force) installations, as well as any other sites for which the AFCEE customers have responsibility.

The resulting contract will provide A&AS for long-term post closing management in support of the Air Force?s privatization programs.  This includes oversight, monitoring, and management of privatized real estate assets such as housing, enhanced use leasing and other privatization endeavors throughout the United States.  Some of the responsibilities include, but are not limited to, oversight and monitoring, analysis, reporting, document management, and education and training.  The Contractor may be required to provide program support services for other tasks in support of the process by which the Government plans and implements the portfolio management of other privatized endeavors. 

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto.  The contract is contemplated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with a firm-fixed-price ordering arrangement. The Government anticipates awarding one (1) full and open contract with a program ceiling of $73 million, an ordering period of sixty months, and an additional twelve months for task order completion.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541611.

We anticipate releasing the Final RFP on or about 10 September 2007.  The Final RFP will be issued via the FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE PCM website located at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/pcm/default.asp?CID=70&folder=PCM.

All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP.  The due date will be no less than 45 calendar days after the release of the RFP.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address.  Inquiries may be directed to afcee.PCM@brooks.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Proposal (RFP No. GAO-2008-N-0004).  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in five (5) parts:  (1) General Requirements; (2) Specific Requirements; (3) Cost Proposals; (4) Technical Evaluation Criteria; (5) Point of Contact.  1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has a need for delivery of Mid-Career  and Pre-Retirement Planning Seminars.  The Human Capital Office (HCO) Benefits Staff is responsible for providing retirement services to GAO employees.  To do this, HCO offers mid-career and pre-retirement planning seminars.  Typically, the mid-career seminars are made available to employees who are within 10-15 years of retirement eligibility and the pre-retirement planning seminars are made available to GAO employees who are within 5 years of retirement eligibility.  Both seminars last for several days and provide in-depth information to assist employees in making critical decisions as they approach and prepare for retirement.  HCO does not  have the necessary subject matter knowledge to conduct the seminars of the scope desired, nor is such expertise available elsewhere in GAO.  In addition, by addressing groups rather than single employees, the seminars represent a cost-effective way of conveying retirement information.   2. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: (A) Scope of work: The contractor will provide an off-the-shelf seminar meeting GAO?s requirements. The Mid-Career Seminar will be for two (2) days.  Forty Five (45) participants normally will attend each session.  It is anticipated that the Mid-Career  Seminar will be delivered at least two (2) times a year at GAO headquarters.  The Pre-Retirement Planning Seminar will be for three (3) days.  Thirty (30) participants normally will attend each session.   It is anticipated that the Pre-Retirement Planning Seminar will be delivered at least four (4) times a year at GAO headquarters and a minimum of  one (1) to a maximum of three (3) times a year at GAO field offices.  (B) Course Contents:   The objectives of the seminars are to provide GAO employees with an array of information to increase their level of understanding and awareness of retirement policies and procedures.  The training will also enable GAO employees to better plan for and make decisions about retirement.  The contractor will use teaching techniques appropriate to the subject matter and the audience.  Each seminar will cover, at a minimum, the following subjects: 
I. The Mid-Career:  Federal Retirement Systems ?

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Dakota Technologies, Incorporated (Dakota), 2201-A 12th Street North, Fargo, North Dakota 58102-1808.  The USCG requires an estimated amount of 16 each Ballast Water Exchange Assurance Meters (BEAM), together with necessary accessories, consumables, training, technical and logistics support.  Delivery is required 90 days after the date of award.  The BEAM units were designed, developed, and manufactured by Dakota under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract.  The BEAM units are a battery-operated handheld meter, weighing less than five pounds, which are designed to assess the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) content of ballast water.  The BEAM units will be used by USCG field personnel, such as Marine Inspectors, Boarding Officers, and Port State Control Officers, to verify and enforce compliance with USCG regulations for the management of ships? ballast water by mid-ocean ballast exchange pursuant to the National Invasive Species Act of 1996.  The BEAM units have the following characteristics: a. water resistant, b. ruggedized to withstand typical shipboard handling conditions, c. capable of operating properly in the temperature range of 33-100?F, d. contain a built-in silica cuvette well with 10mm path length, e. excite and monitor the humic/fulvic acid portion of CDOM in ballast water where 250-400 nm excitation is coupled with 420-480 nm emission, f. capable of a less-than 1.0 ppb limit of detection on quinine sulfate reference, g. an accuracy of at least 5% relative difference between the unit and a reference grade instrument using quinine sulfate over the range of 1-100 ppb, h. a measurement repeatability (relative standard deviation) of triplicate measurements of samples over the range in g. above, i. an inter-unit reproducibility error of 3% or less when measuring subaliquats of  the same test solutions over the range in g. above.  Dakota is the only known company that can provide a device capable of performing this requirement.  Contracting with Dakota will avoid a substantial duplication of cost necessary for any other company to design, develop, and manufacture a device that is able to assist the USCG to perform its mission in regulating ballast water exchange practices of ships bound for ports or places of the U. S.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. If your company believes it can provide the required equipment in a timely manner, you may submit a statement of your capabilities by 2:00 P.M., local time, September 7, 2007 to the Contracting Officer at USCG Headquarters, Commandant (CG-9122), 2100 Second St., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20593-0001.  Information may be faxed to 202-475-3905, or may be e-mailed to Eugene.M.Feinberg@uscg.mil .  Pursuant to authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, supplies or services are available from only one responsible source.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note 22.

If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit the New Orleans area, this will require that USCG Sector New Orleans stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  Sector New Orleans will be forced to reconstitute full operations from this satellite location.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The facility must be at least 50 miles and no further than 250 miles North of Sector New Orleans (located in Downtown New Orleans).  A total of 95 hotel rooms will be needed in addition to 2 conferences rooms.  Parking will be needed for up to 200 vehicles.  The NAICS code is 721110.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
The United States Government ("Government") is seeking expressions of interest from potential sources for office space in St. Clairsville, OH.  The US Government's existing lease in St Clairsville is expiring and the Government is considering if it would be economically advantageous for the Government to relocate.  The Government is interested in leasing approximately 9,911 useable square feet of office space which includes 1,000 useable square feet of storage space with vehicle drive-up access for use by the Mine safety & Health Administration within the following delineated area:

5 miles North on Route 9 and 5 miles South on Route 9, 8 miles East on I70 to the river and 5 miles West on I70 

The space must yield a minimum of 9,911 ANSI/BOMA ("Useable") square feet of contiguous space.  The anticipated term is 10 years, 5 years firm as a fully serviced lease.  In addition to the rental costs the Government will also factor in costs of moving to a new location including, but not limited to, physical move, tenant improvements, above-standard/specialized alterations/equipment, furniture relocation, telecommunications, and other related costs.  Note that these same costs may not be factored in when evaluating whether it is most advantageous to the Government to remain in the current lease location.  

The building must be located in a professional surrounding and/or tasteful rehabilitation in current use.  Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained.  The Government requires a minimum of 40 dedicated, secure parking spaces for Government vehicles, plus sufficient parking for privately owned vehicles and visitor parking.  Building ownership may not be affiliated with the mining industry.  The Government has a preference for first-floor / ground level space.  The location should provide covered entrance ways.  

Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to demonstrate meeting all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and local codes and regulations including but not limited to fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at minimum (This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):

Building name/address

The USJFCOM requires the equipment as network domain separation units for NSA certification, testing and evaluation of the Multinational Information Sharing Cross Domain Collaborative Information Environment capability.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with BAE Systems and its authorized resellers for this requirement.

The XTS-410 is the only currently available device that supports STOP/OS 6.4, is under evaluation for Common Criteria EAL 5+ augmented, and supports the Data Sync Guard software.  BAE Systems owns the proprietary rights as well as copyrights and patents to the hardware/software and is the sole manufacturer of the products.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 334119 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.

<DESC>The Naval Air Weapons Division China Lake seeks proposals for a firm fixed price research report on thermochronometric analysis of the advection of mass and heat as it may relate to formation of a geothermal system using the Hawthorne, NV, area as a model.  This study shall utilize (U-Th)/He mineral thermochronometric techniques to assess the rate of uplift and cooling of rock mass in the vicinity of the central Wassuk Range that lies adjacent to the Hawthorne Army Ammunition Depot (HWAD) located in west-central Nevada. These techniques shall be applied to apatite, zircon, titanite, monazite, rutile, magnetite, and xenotime recovered from exposed plutonic rocks that crop-out less than 5km from a hot geothermal well in the Walker Lake basin. The successful offeror should have the capability to analyze for U-Th-Pb series mineral as well as samarium, all of which can be vital to correctly interpreting the basic thermochronometric data. The study must incorporate and reconcile previous thermochronometric work done in the study area, and shall utilize previously existing geological and geophysical data sets that are available to prepare an uplift-cooling model for the Wassuk Range.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for - Satellite Modem DMD20 (quantity required 2 each) - L-Band RX Option (quantity required 2 each) - L-Band TX option (quantity required 2 each) - 20Mpbs option (quantity required 2 each) - 8PSK option (quantity required 2 each) - 16QAM (quantity required 2 each) - Turbo Codec 20M option (quantity required 2 each) - Ethernet bridge option (quantity required 2 each) - 20 MBPS Option (quantity required 1 each) - 8PSK option (quantity required 1 each) - 16QAM Option (quantity required 1 each) NASA/GRC intends to purchase the item from Radyne Corporation.	This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: NASA Ames purchased several Radyne DMD-20 satellite modems and delivered one modem to NASA GRC to support various satellites based inter-center demonstrations.   NASA GRC and ARC have supported multiple disaster preparedness exercises and various field exercises in support of research projects.  Other NASA Centers are developing ground stations which could be used to link NASA Centers together in the event of an emergency.  Satellite Modems are typically not compatible with each other due to the large number of features, options and settings between models.	New modulation formats are available such as O-QPSK, 8-PSK, and 16-QAM which increase the information data rate for a given bandwidth. NASA also needed to confirm compatibility between the different types of overhead channels, scrambers, and interleavers, used.  The DMD-20 satellite modems have become the standard for use between NASA centers. They are a current generation product and include the latest technologies. Purchasing DMD-20 satellite modems is necessary to maintain compatibility with and ensure interoperability between the DMD-20 modems used by other NASA centers.  Therefore it would be the best interest of the government to purchase directly from Radyne Corporation. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 noon local time on August 15, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Ametek HD300M Dycor Dymaxion Mass Spectrometer. Please, contact only Tim Carson about quotes and other information at tim.carson@nasa.gov. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Vacuum Solutions Group Southeast for the following reasons: 1.	The purchase of the HD300M-Dycor Dymaxion Mass Spectrometer will allow the Environmental Test Facility to daisy chain the Dycor Mass Spectrometers to the existing Dycor Mass Spectrometers in use at the Environmental Test Facility at this time. It will eliminate the possibility for incompatibility of different makes of Mass Spectrometers to be daisy chained together and not being able to talk to one another. 2.	The Data Acquisition Computer and Software Operating System that support and operate the Dycor Mass Spectrometers is already in use with the Dycor Mass Spectrometers in the Environmental Test Facility.  This will eliminate the need to purchase and checkout a new type of Data Acquisition Computer and Software Operating System. 	  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 13, 2007.

<SUBJECT>D -- Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) Contractor to support Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)
<SOLNBR>RFP-CMS-2007-0021
<RESPDATE>082307
<ARCHDATE>09072007
<CONTACT>John Webster, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-7229, Fax 410-786-9922, Email John.Webster@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to develop a Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) front-end application for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) claims processing contractors.  

Currently, front end Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) processing for DME claims occurs in 4 separate systems. Two of these systems are operated by DME MACs and two are operated by data services contractors under direct contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The front-end EDI systems perform edits on incoming Medicare DME claims and forwards the output data from transactions that pass edits to the core of the VMS shared system claims processing environment. Each of the 4 systems used for DME front end transaction processing has been developed as a proprietary system to meet its developer?s own business objectives. Logic specific to Medicare requirements was added to accommodate the Medicare claims transactions.  Also, these EDI environments accept data files from the VMS shared system processing to create transactions to be sent to EDI trading partners (e.g., banks, suppliers, providers, other CMS contractors), in the form of claims payment remittance advice transactions and claims status response transactions.  The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) transactions currently passes through an exchange with VMS for both inbound and outbound transactions.

Since each system is owned and developed by separate entities, variations exist in the way in which individual front end systems process claims and in the results they produce. Accordingly, the results of transaction editing can vary from system to system for a given transaction type and can result in similar transactions being rejected by some systems while being approved by others. This creates confusion with suppliers and beneficiaries. It can also lead to the rejection of eligible claims as well as the payment of ineligible claims depending upon which front end system processed the transaction.

The CEDI DME MAC front-end system shall be discrete to the contractor and shall not be integrated with any other commercial application and processing environment. The primary functions of the CEDI DME MAC front-end system generally will include: 

?	An electronic mailbox system for suppliers to submit claims as well as offer customer support; 
?	Conducts EDI translation activities for all ANSI ASC X12 4010A1 files and future versions adopted by Federal regulation promulgated by DHHS and/or CMS.  The use of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software is preferred, but optional, at contract award; however, the use of COTS software is required before contract option year 2.
?	NCPDP Routing and translation services (optional at contract award but required before contract option year 1);
?	Connectivity support for EDI users;
?	EDI enrollment; 
?	Free Billing Software (FBS) distribution and support; 
?	Submitter profile changes and updates;
?	Transaction testing; 
?	EDI helpdesk support; and 
?	Misdirected claims and acknowledgement transfer service between the 4 DME MACs.

In order to be considered for this requirement an offeror:

?	must be able to demonstrate their experience with, and current and direct access to, VMS shared system claims processing environment.  

?	must currently process DME claims for adjudication and payment in an active production EDI environment.  

There are no exceptions to the requirements listed under the first two bullet points; offerors who do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.  

?	must possess, at the minimum, Capability Maturity Model? Integration (CMMI) Level II accreditation at contract award.  The offeror must be able to achieve CMMI Level III accreditation before contract option year 2.

?	must be able to determine the best approach for transitioning the workload (68,850,000 annual claims) from the current four DME MAC front-end systems.  

?	must have existing EDI staff familiar with Medicare front-end systems, or show the ability to recruit and train new staff within a short period of time, in order to perform the functions described in this Sources Sought Notice.  The CEDI system must be fully operational for all DME MAC claims in approximately four months from date of award.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for the CEDI DME MAC. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a competitive requirement.  This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 30, 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   Under authority granted in FAR 13.501, the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to seek a quotation on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS from Dr. Kalin to complete work on the following three tasks: The first task deals with evaluating a new methodology for estimating predictive  uncertainty of two water quality models. This task involves evaluation of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology and testing a new, Bayesian-update methodology to a suite of three models. The first is an analytical sediment-water column nitrogen flux model to be  applied to nitrogen data collected from sediment cores at sites in the Chesapeake Bay. The second is the distributed Kinematic Erosion Model (KINEROS) applied to runoff and sediment yield from the experimental Treynor watershed, Iowa. The contractor will adapt the two models to conduct MC  simulations and then examine a Bayesian-update method (originated by EPA) and compare the results with the GLUE methodology.  The second task aims at developing a process-based model for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphor) retention/removal and recycling in wetlands. The contractor will code, and if  necessary, modify, a conceptual mathematical model for nitrogen and phosphorus retention, transformation, removal, and recycling in wetlands. The module will be tested by application to real nitrogen-phosphor wetland data.  The code will be a generic standalone module to be integrated in Task 3 to  a selected distributed watershed model. The third task involves integrating the nutrient wetland model into a distributed watershed model to simulate the function of wetlands in the retention/removal and recycling of nutrients delivered from diffuse sources in watersheds. Dr. Kalin is the only  known source with knowledge of the model code development and the inner details of the watershed model.  It is not considered practical or possible for sources that were not involved in the initial code and model development effort and lack knowledge of the coding to perform this effort within a  reasonable time frame and budget. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by August 23, 2007 in order to be considered by the  EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487 2107 or by e mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this purchase order. Telephone responses will not be honored.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.  The center will provide the appropriate staff such as guards and maintenance personnel as necessary for the oversight of the work effort.  The contractor will provide labor, materials, and waste disposal as appropriate for this project.

1.5  Contract Type.  Firm Fixed Price Contract

	http://www.msha.gov/TECHSUPP/ACC/directions.pdf

 
1.7  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for this project is only the time needed to successfully complete the outlined work and be acceptable to the government.

Any questions about this notice, please contact Mr. Jun Ji, code 25331 at 407-380-4020 or jun.ji@navy.mil. All other contractor interested in subcontracting opportunities must contract CSC directly. 

Full details of the requirement as follow:
Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) Training System Modifications


Numerous Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) Training Systems are being used for training by U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard training commands.  These existing training systems require modifications in order to meet existing and emerging training requirements.  This SOO outlines modifications to the baseline software required by the training commands.

Each objective should be priced to the smallest reasonable component.  Specific objectives for the contractor, as part of the total system performance responsibilities include:

1.	Upgrade voice recognition technology to improve voice recognitions in the following areas:
a.	Modify the vocabulary to accept common deviations from exact phrases.
b.	Eliminate the need for each student to train the voice engine.
c.	Provide enhanced diagnostic tools.
d.	Provide a voice recognition engine that meets current state-of-the-art technology standards for voice recognition performance and accuracy.
2.	Upgrade propulsion system model, GUI (Graphic User Interface), and voice recognition vocabulary to provide consistency between the order given, the IOS display and console displays.  This includes enabling students to give combined and split engine orders by bell, speed, RPM, and pitch.  Issuing equivalent orders by various input means (e.g. physical helm, voice bell order, voice RPM order, etc.) should result in identical propulsion system behavior.  The standard of a 1/3 bell equals 5 knots, 2/3 bell equals 10 knots, etc should be used.  Unless specific data is available for a ship, a twisting order should result in slight forward motion for fixed pitch ships and slight aft motion for CRP ships.
3.	Separate the pitch model and the shaft RPM model on CRP (Controllable Reversible Pitch) ships to achieve a more realistic thrust response.  The result should be more realistic behaviors of CRP ships when making large throttle changes such as a crash back.  When the lee helm of a CRP ship is adjusted, it outputs two (2) commands, a throttle output for the engines and a pitch output for the CPP (Controllable Pitch Propeller) system and each system (enigne & CPP) adjusts independent of each other.  In cases where the pitch is between 100% and -100%, the throttle is fixed and there is a physics based response of the RPM in which the higher torque required for larger pitch causes a minor drop in RPM.  Conning officers are able to issue pitch or RPM orders.  In the case of a pitch order, there is a fixed throttle input, and in the case of an RPM order, there is a fixed pitch input.  When a pitch or RPM order is given, the lee helm is adjusted to achieve the exact ordered value.
4.	Enable multiple engineering states to high fidelity ships.  Instructors should be able to implement instant or delayed state changes.
a.	Full power (All engines/boilers and all shafts online)
b.	Split plant (One engine per shaft online, all shafts online)
c.	Cross Connected (For steam ships only, One boiler online, all shafts online)
d.	Trail shaft (One engine and one shaft online, other shaft freewheels with pitch set at 100%)
e.	Locked shaft (One shaft and one engine online, One shaft is locked with pitch at the pitch % that prevents torque on the shaft)
f.	Cold plant (No engines or shafts online)
5.	Add ordered pitch and RPM indicators on console GUIs.
6.	Modify IOS GUI so instructor can input an immediate change to pitch, RPM, and speed during a scenario.
7.	Modify the casualty system to better reflect common casualty drills conducted by the navy and provide a more relevant casualty control panel for the instructor.  Common casualty drills include:
a.	Steering Related Casualties
i.	Loss of rudder control ? Rudder moves to a state defined by instructor.  Rudder shall default to the current state of the rudder when casualty is activated
ii.	Loss of rudder angle indication
iii.	Loss of Gyro indication
iv.	Loss of Gyro (affects radar, chart, & gyro indicators)
b.	Propulsion Related Casualties
i.	Engine casualty ? Causes an engine (Gas Turbine, Steam, or Diesel) to trip off line
ii.	Loss of pitch control ? Pitch moves to a state defined by the instructor.  Pitch shall default to the current state of the pitch when the casualty is activated
iii.	Controllable Propulsion Casualty ? Instructor takes control of lee helm command for that shaft.
iv.	Stop and Lock ? Shaft freewheels until it is at 0 RPM (this requires the Conning officer to stop way through the water).  Once at 0 RPM the shaft locks
c.	Other casualties
i.	General Alarm
ii.	Fire Alarm
iii.	Flooding Alarm
iv.	Loss of GPS
v.	Loss of Radar
vi.	Blank Alarm - Allows instructor to type in the name of an alarm so it shows up on the console.
8.	Shorten the length of tug towing hawser.  When pulling, tug lines should be approximately one half the current simulated length.
9.	Upgrade binocular displays to current COTS technology with durability for the current training environment.
10.	Modify audio model to provide enhanced aural feedback to the student.  Engine sound on a ship is based on which engines are online, the RPM of that engine, and the location of the engine.  Anchor sounds should be louder and adjust to the rate of anchor payout.
11.	Upgrade the visual appearance of ship wakes including:
a.	Enhancing the appearance of wakes resulting from ships hull interacting with water.
b.	Add visual cuing based on wash from propellers and waterjets including the spreading effect.
c.	Add stimulated wave crests based on ship wake
d.	Wakes should have an initial velocity that slows to a stop and fades over time.  The time of persistence should be based on the level of agitation.
12.	Add multiple P&D (Phone and Distance) points on AOE model to support UNREP scenarios with all classes of U.S. Ships.
13.	Add the influence of squat on turning rates.
14.	Modify and/or optimize software to increase visual frame rate, decrease percentage of processor use, and leverage new technologies such as multiple core processors and new graphics card capabilities.
15.	Add binocular mode functionality to the HMD button.
16.	Add the ability for an observer to see a spotlight pointed directly at them.
17.	Conduct a study and provide a report on the integration of COVE with the Fredyn system and an operator guidance system such as Orpheus.  Study and report should include:
a.	Feasibility and level of effort required for integration.  
b.	Capabilities and limitations of the integrated system.
c.	Integration alternatives and risks.
d.	Detailed proposal for integrating systems.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer (CCR) Research, Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB), Immunology Section (IS) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with AppTec, 2540 Executive Dr., St. Paul, MN  55120 for Testing of CD64, HLA-A2, 4-1BBL Master Cell Bank. The mission of the Immunology Section of the Pediatric Oncology Branch is to develop effective immune based therapies for childhood cancer.  Previous work has demonstrated that commonly administered cancer therapies induce profound lymphocyte depletion in children treated for cancer and that the period of lymphopenia can be exploited for therapeutic gain if sufficient numbers of tumor reactive lymphocytes can be administered.  The POB has previously identified and published evidence demonstrating that T cells generated using artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing 4-1BBL are very potent at responding to pediatric tumors.  A major goal of the POB's research program is to administer T cells generated via aAPCs to pediatric cancer patients rendered lymphopenic by cytotoxic therapy. The Cell and Vaccine Research Center at the Abramson Cancer Institute at the University of Pennsylvania invented the 4-1BBL expressing aAPC and is an active research collaborator with the POB.  In collaboration with investigations at the Cell and Vaccine Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania, the POB generated a clinical grade master cell bank of 4-1BBL expressing aAPCs which also coexpress CD64 (the high affinity Fc receptor) and HLA-A2.  These cells potently expand antigen specific T cell populations. Prior to use in clinical trials this master cell bank must undergo a series of rigorous tests for quality control and sterility as dictated by the US Pharmacopoeia and US FDA requirements.  The creators of this master cell bank, the Cell and Vaccine Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania have recently generated master cell banks expressing several of the same molecules used in the POB?s product.  Apptec has already performed the quality control testing on these cell banks and therefore has unique experience and expertise in the evaluation of this product.  If POB were to use an alternative contractor, there would be significant introduction of new variables into the analyses which could adversely affect the ability to interpret results.  This is a continuation of an on-going research and it is essential that the cell bank be processed by the same laboratory in order not to introduce new variables into on-going clinical trial. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 2PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 17, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

The Solexa clonal single molecular array technology combined with their sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) technique on the Solexa 1G Genome analyzer can identify perfectly 25 bp sequence tag from each DNA molecule in a library and therefore allow investigators to identify the specific sequence of up to 1 gigabases in a single run.  There are no other manufacturers known to the NCI that have either not yet marketed or are not capable of producing this number of DNA sequencing reads in a single run (20 million sequences).  Without this efficient identification of DNA regions, the NCI cannot complete the studies on the function of chromatin, the regulation of genome expression, or the analysis of mutations in cancer specimens.  The Solexa Genome Analysis System is solely manufactured and distributed by Illumina, Inc.    The Solexa CSMA (Clonal Single Molecule Array), cluster growth, and sequence detection are internationally patented processes.  Solexa (now part of Illumina) holds these patents. 

To meet rapidly emerging needs of NCI investigators, the acquisition of the Solexa Genetic Analyzer Solexa is necessary for the continued successes of NCI research and studies. This instrument (manufactured by Illumina) can generate 20 million sequence reads and 1 gigabase of total sequence. The applications of this technology in cancer research are far-reaching, including exon characterization, genome location analysis of regulatory factors, and gene expression analysis by sequence tags. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order (FAR 13) on a noncompetitive basis to the Constella Group, LLC, Rockville, Maryland. Constella will provide statistical support for the Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS (CMHRA), consisting of advice on statistical issues related to experimental design, power and sample size calculations, management of data for statistical analyses, data analyses, development of statistical methods specifically needed for appropriate analysis of data of interest to CMHRA, interpretation of results of data analyses, preparation of written descriptions of data analysis methods and results for publications and reports, and preparation of manuscripts for publication of novel statistical methods or applications developed for CMHRA. When carrying out the various statistical analyses, Constella will use (in consultation with the CMHRA) a variety of statistical procedures, which may include, but may not be limited to, fixed-, random-, and mixed-effect analysis of variance, general linear models, logistic regression and other categorical analysis methods, factor analysis and other multivariate techniques, Bayesian methods, and methods developed specifically for the analysis of NIMH data.

Specifically, the primary aim of this contract is for Constella to analyze (in consultation with CMHRA) the data from the NIMH supported study PACTG 188: ?Neurodevelopmental evaluation of HIV Seropositive and Seronegative Children?.  The data from PACTG 188 will be provided by NIMH. The objectives of the study are to compare neurobehavioral development of children perinatally infected with HIV to uninfected children born to HIV+ mothers as well as a non HIV-exposed control group.  In addition, the second objective is to identify in the group with HIV-infection, those infants and children that have a divergent level of profile of functioning, and to determine both behavioral and medical predictors for such a natural history.  Finally, the NIMH wants to see whether it is possible on basis of the data, using a form of item analysis, to establish a shortened assessment that would be highly sensitive to changes in the normal neurobehavioral development and that were prognostic for a worse outcome. 
The period of performance is 12 months.  It is anticipated that 3,400 hours will be required for this requirement. 
An award to any other source would affect the NIH?s prior and current research under protocols.  Constella assisted in the novel design approach under the protocols.  Constella has also performed a similar analysis of data under a larger R&D contract.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications and Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) has a requirement for an additional 80 Radar Processors (RPs), NSN: 5840-01-547-2653, as well as options for 270 additional RPs and 50 RP spares kits consi sting of the RP components necessary to replace items that fail.  The RP is a critical component of the AN/TPQ-36(V), AN/TPQ-37(V), and AN/TPQ-46 FIREFINDER Radar Systems, performing all signal and data processing functions required to automatically locate  hostile mortar and artillery projectiles.  Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), Fullerton, CA, was competitively awarded Firm-Fixed Price Contract W15P7T-06-C-M207 on 7 March 2006 to design, fabricate, integrate, test and deliver a replacement RP for FIRFINDER Radar Systems.  TRS designed the required RP and is the only source that is in production of this item. The Government does not possess a detailed Technical Data Package (TDP) for this item.  As such, the Government intends to issue a modification to Contr act W15P7T-06-C-M207 with TRS for the aforementioned RPs and RP spares kits.

<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>09302008
<CONTACT>Karen Shelley, (937) 904-4217
<DESC>Industry Days Information: The previously advertised Industry Day for a potential contract for CLS  Support for the AUP is now postponed pending completion of a revised RFI  that will be shown on PIXS within the next 10 business days. This deferral  of the Industry Days and publication of a revised RFI and related question  set is necessary as the program is undergoing a revision in the definition  and scope of the proposed contract. This is an update to the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) CLS  Sustainment for FY09-FY13 Industry Days currently scheduled for 21-22 Aug  07 at Randolph AFB, TX.  For visitor access to the base, we have been  asked to consolidate a list of attendees by offeror.  Please submit the  attached form by 10 Aug 07. Updated Information: The previous contract was an IDIQ contract, and we do not plan to utilize  that contract type for the contract which results from this RFI.  The  COMBS operations which are envisioned apply solely to the AUP equipment  and include managing the supply and running the counter, they do not  include flight line maintenance.  List of LRUs included in AUP  modification is attached. Additional Information: Current Contractor:  McDonnell Douglas Corporation - A Wholly Owned  Subsidiary of the Boeing Company in St Louis MO Current Contract Number: F41608-96-D-0700 Current Contract Expires on 30 Sep 2008 TITLE:  T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program CLS Sustainment Description:  1.  337th Aeronautical System Group (337 AESG), 663d  Aeronautical Systems Squadron (663 AESS) is contemplating a competitively  awarded contract for sustainment of the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program  (AUP).  This Request for Information is intended to provide the Air Force  with an understanding of the interest within industry, the technology, and  resources available to support competitive acquisition of a contract to  cover contractor logistics support (CLS) sustainment of the avionics  suites of 450 AETC, 3 AFMC and 10 Navy T-38C AUP aircraft.  The T-38C AUP  avionics suite consists of approximately 60 non-developmental (NDI) and  commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  The CLS contract will be a  firm-fixed price, performance based service contract for the logistics  support and sustainment of the T-38C AUP consisting of a base year (FY09)  and with four additional years of FFP options.  The contract will provide  for: a)	Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations at  each of AETCs T-38 main operating bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus  AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB and supporting operations  for Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS); b)	A CLS program to repair removed components at the contractors (or  Original Equipment Manufacturers) facilities and return to COMBS, based  upon a fixed price for each of the annual number of hours flown by AETC,  AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 110,000 hours total  annually); c)	Over and Above (O & A) activities necessary for correction of problems  found during maintenance; d)	Materials for the O & A corrections; e)	Technical data and technical manuals, recommendations to responsible  engineering organization; f)	Field Service Representatives at each of the AETC Main Operating Bases,  Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS; g)	An effective Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages  Management (DMSMS) program; h)	A system that collects, manages and archives Maintenance Fault Lists  (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL)/engine,  flight loads and ACMI data for each  flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis  and could lead to product improvement; i)	A damaged equipment program; j)	In coordination with organization having systems engineering  responsibility resolve any issues involving software support, engineering  services and material deficiency reporting; k)	and the program management necessary to support these activities. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed AUP components,  providing spares during repair process, performing Field Service  Representative tasks, and operation of a Contractor Operated Maintenance  Base Supply (COMBS) at each AETC MOB.  The period of performance for this  contract is planned FY09 through FY13. 2.  The T-38C CLS Sustainment approach will include performance based  logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) at the avionics  level, and at the LRU level (system level avionics MTBF of 60 hours).  Guaranteed part turn-around times and issue rates at the COMBS are  planned.  In order to comply with the COMBS turn around times, the  contractor must assure that sufficient spares are available or other  arrangements are in place to assure that these times are met. Other  metrics and your suggestions for metrics will be considered.    A  technical data package (most current configuration) will be available in  Aug/Sep 2007.  The contractor must comply with the International Traffic  in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as required to support repairs if by foreign  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 3.  A companion program will be managed by ASC for software and  (potentially) hardware block upgrades to the T-38C avionics suite that are  necessary to assure that the T-38C AUP continues to provide AETC with  current up-to-date training capability.  Engineering and configuration  authority thus will rest with this ASC program.  The sustainment  contractor may need to establish associate contractor agreements with the  contractor performing the block upgrades.  The sustainment contractor  should plan for a low level of engineering change proposal activity  arising from the block upgrades, DMSMS, etc. 4. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an  offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.

<CONTACT>Sally Aultman 703-432-4126
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the offer due date to August 14, 2007/4:30 PM local time, revise the SOW and FAR clause 52.212-2, and incorporates FAR clause 52.217-7 in full text. This amendment also addresses questions received from potential offeror as follows: 1.  We have a question about CLINs 0001-0003 and Option CLINS 0101  0403. Under 52.212-2 (2) (b) page 19, the RFP states: (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). a.  Per FAR Part 15.404-1(g), pricing is unbalanced where the price of one or more of the CLINs appear significantly over or understated when analyzing the prices proposed by the offeror which may increase performance risk and could result in the Governments payment of unreasonably high prices. b.  Also, with regards to options, is there a requested timeframe that the Government desires for the Options pricing to remain valid?  In accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-7. 52.217-7 -- Option for Increased Quantity -- Separately Priced Line Item. The Government may require the delivery of the numbered line item, identified in the Schedule as an option item, in the quantity and at the price stated in the Schedule. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within one year of contract award. Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.  If the Government exercises an option, the Government shall have an additional year to exercise the next option quantities.  The Government's right to exercise the options shall continue in one year increments until all options have been exercised. 2.  On Preparation of Proposals:     a.  Does the 5 page limit include or exclude the SF 1449? The page limitation applies only to the technical proposal; it does not apply to the completed and signed SF 1449 and continuation sheets.       b.	Does the 5 page limit include or exclude the Cover page?  The page limitation applies only to the technical proposal; it does not apply to the completed and signed SF 1449 and continuation sheets.       c.	Does the 5 page limit include or exclude any Rep and Certs?  The page limitation applies only to the technical proposal; it does not apply to the completed and signed SF 1449 and continuation sheets, including the Reps and Certs.       d.	Can supplemental information be provided outside the 5 pages if it is believed by the offeror to add significance to the proposal as an addendum?  Please limit your proposal to five pages.  Additional data that may be accepted includes technical documentation, testing, and certifications to the specifications.  3.  CLIN1     a.	Is a tolerance of 2+.125 -0 acceptable for the glow tape square on CLIN1?  This means the square could be slightly larger than 2 but never smaller.  Yes     b.	Would it be judicious to require the hook fastener to be in compliance with MIL A-A-55126B?  The Government only requires the items to meet the requirements of the design specification.      c.	How many samples do you desire? One sample of each. 4.  CLIN 2 and CLIN3:     a.	Is the intent for the button on device to attach to the forward button on the shoulder pocket of the marine uniform? Yes   Does Figure 1, with the exception of square size, represent the general location for the glow square when adhered? No, when affixed correctly, the marker will extend vertically from the button to the base of the pocket.            b.	Are there specifications on the tan and green colors that should be adhered to?  No.  However, the color should be very similar to the respective colors of the Marine Corp Pattern (MARPAT) utility uniform.     c.	Is it desirable for the button on square to be free to rotate around the button?  No     d.	All offerors must be provided with the same or similar information.  Therefore commenting on the reasonableness of any offerors proposed solution prior to the actual evaluation of proposals received in response to the solicitation would be inappropriate unless the particular offeror that sought our preliminary response also provided us with explicit permission to share our response and the proposed solution to each prospective offer.  As it appears that no offeror has provided us explicit permission to share our thoughts with each prospective offeror on its proposed solution even though it has provided us a drawing, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the drawing and will not do so at this time.       e.	How many samples do you desire?  One sample of each. 5.  Is earlier delivery, at no additional charge to the US Government, desirable?  If so, will delivery be considered as part of the evaluation criteria?  Yes, early delivery is desirable.  It would be beneficial to get this equipment delivered as soon as possible.  However, early delivery will not be considered as part of the evaluation criteria since we only require that delivery dates be met.   6.  Instruction to Offerors (b) (5) requests the inclusion of, terms of any express warranty.  How will the Government consider warranty as part of the evaluation criteria? The evaluation factors for this solicitation are Technical Acceptability and Past Performance.  Warranty is not an evaluation factor.  Please include your express warranty if one accompanies your commercially available products.  An express warranty is not required for this procurement.    7.  In the Description / Specification / Statement of Work, Design Specification 2.0 specifics degree reflection angle is 0.5 degrees.  Would it be possible that the 0.5 degrees is a typo or is this correct? The degree reflection angle .5 degrees is an administrative error and should read 5 degrees vice 0.5 degrees.  8.  Is the Government going to test the samples provided by the offerors?  If so what are the intended parameters which are going to be tested?  How will the competitors be rated against each other for these parameters?   The Government intends to evaluate the products for technical acceptability based on the Description/Specification/Statement of Work included in the solicitation.  Award will be made to the responsive and responsible Offeror whose proposal (conforming to the solicitation) represents the lowest evaluated price meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors.  An excerpt from the solicitation that provides design specification is provided below: 	DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS. 	IR Reflective Personnel Markers consist of IR reflective tape, with an operating 	wavelength of 830-1060 nanometers (nM) and 5 degree reflection angle, and a 	means to secure the marker to the uniform.  To the unaided eye, the texture and 	finish of the IR reflective tape will exhibit no reflective glow.   	IR Reflective Personnel Markers for the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU)  	IR Reflective Personnel Markers for the BDUs shall be manufactured with a 	button-on, 2x 2 squares of IR reflective material that is sewn on to a nylon 	backing.  This backing will have one button hole located at the top of the marker 	so that it can be attached to the shoulder pocket buttons of the BDU. 	IR Reflective Personnel Markers for the Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) IR Reflective Personnel Markers for the FROG uniform shall be 2x 2 Velcro affixed squares. 9.  Can the Government rank the relative importance as prescribed in 52.212-2 (a) and 15.304 (e).  The solicitation shall also state, at a minimum, whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are - (1) Significantly more important than cost or price; (2) Approximately equal to cost or price; or (3) Significantly less important than cost or price.   52.212-1 included in the solicitation states Award will be to the responsive and responsible Offeror whose proposal (conforming to the solicitation) represents the lowest evaluated price meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors.  This has been added to 52.212-2 also. 10.  What is the operational effective range requirement for the specification?  Products are expected to work within what range?  800 Meters.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.  The center will provide the appropriate staff such as guards and maintenance personnel as necessary for the oversight of the work effort.  The contractor will provide labor, materials, and waste disposal as appropriate for this project.

1.5  Contract Type.  Firm Fixed Price Contract
 
1.6	Place of Performance/Hours of Operation.  The building where the work will be performed is a government-owned structure and is identified as Building #1.  the location of the building is within the Center?s confines at the following address:
MSHA Approval and Certification Center
Industrial Park Road
Triadelphia, WV 
The Center is located just off the Dallas Pike exit of Interstate 70 near Wheeling, WV.  Directions to the Center can be found on the web at the following address: 
	http://www.msha.gov/TECHSUPP/ACC/directions.pdf

 
1.7  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for this project is only the time needed to successfully complete the outlined work and be acceptable to the government.  It is anticipated that the work would require a minimum of 2 days but no more than 5 days to complete.  Because the work requires a period of dry weather conditions, it is anticipated that work will be scheduled around forecasted conditions.
 
1.8 Privacy Act.  Work on this project does not require that personnel have access to Privacy Information.  
 
1.9  Personal Service.  This task order is not being used to procure personal services prohibited by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part  37.104 titled ?Personal services contract?.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.  The center will provide the appropriate staff such as guards and maintenance personnel as necessary for the oversight of the work effort.  The contractor will provide labor, materials, and waste disposal as appropriate for this project.

1.5  Contract Type.  Firm Fixed Price Contract

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to include an additional address and point of contact, as reflected below, for the submittal of responses to the following sources sought synopsis.  Please ensure all responses are submitted to both of the people at the addresses listed below by 12:00 p.m. on 20 August 2007.

COMNAVAIRSYSCOM is seeking information from potential suppliers regarding the H-46E torque indicating system.  The torque indicating system provides engine performance information to the pilot and copilot.  The system consists of six torque sensors, two temperature compensators, two signal conditioners and two torquemeter indicators.  Inaccuracies in the existing torque indicating system have resulted in unnecessary maintenance and parts replacement.  Also, support equipment required to maintain the torque indicating system has become obsolete and is no longer procurable.  The new torque indicating system will incorporate the functionality of the signal conditioners and torquemeter indicators into one indicator that resembles the existing torquemeter indicator.  Minimal new support equipment will be required and the requirement for existing torque test sets will be eliminated.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This sources sought synopsis is seeking information from sources that are capable of manufacturing torque indicating systems.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis should be in the form of a technical approach that outlines processes needed to ensure that all aspects of a torque indicating systems engineering methodology are used in the execution of the program.  At a minimum, (1) the new torque indicating system will be compatible and integrated with existing H-46E equipment; (2) meet or exceed accuracy of the H-46E onboard aircraft integrated maintenance system (AIMS); (3) resemble the current H-46E torquemeter indicator; (4) provide torque signal validity; (5) require minimal peculiar support equipment for maintenance; (6) have minimal operational and maintenance impact; and (7) combine functionality of the current H-46E signal conditioner and torquemeter indicator into one indicator that utilizes existing location on both the pilot and copilot consoles.  Due to the urgency of the need and the need for the torque instrumentation to interface with other on board systems, the Contractor shall possess recent H-46E engine instrument development experience for this effort.  It is requested that all interested parties submit a capability statement/documentation (under 25 pages) specifically addressing the technical approach to be taken to satisfy their statement of work tasking, potential teaming arrangements, related past performance, general corporate information, and their business size.  TELEPHONE REPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING (i.e. fax, email, or letterhead).  All responses will be kept confidential and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any proposal preparation costs associated with responding to this synopsis.  Proprietary Data in the responses will be protected where so designed.  All responses shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 20 Aug 2007.  All responses must be submitted to the Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Julie Paul, Code: AIR-2.4.3.3.2., Bldg. # 2272, Suite 353, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Email address:  Julie.Paul@navy.mil; Telephone Number (301) 757-6570; FAX (301) 757-9039.

NAA is a nuclear analytical method of determining the element composition of samples. An integrated hardware and software system is used to collect data, reduce data and perform the calculations necessary to produce final results by this technique. 

The system that NIST currently has consists of 20 gamma-ray detectors with associated hardware, all of which are interfaced with VMS-based minicomputers.  This system must be replaced because the VMS operating system is not compliant with NIST Information Technology (IT) security requirements and because the VMS-based system is no longer supported by the original vendor (Nuclear Data/Canberra).

This acquisition will provide the hardware and software needed to move several of the detection systems from the current VMS-based data acquisition software to PC-based data acquisition software AND to provide new PC-based NAA software that will perform calculations on all spectral data acquired on the new and existing systems. The requested hardware/software system must be integrated for the acquisition and calculation of newly acquired data AND the software must work with data acquired on legacy systems that use the Canberra Industries CAM (*cnf) and Ortec ADCAM (*.chn)CAM spectral data format types. 

This hardware and software, which is classified as commercial, will be competed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, via full & open competition. 

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 
500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number

<DESC>The Air Force has a requirement for psychological instruments and supporting processes that accurately identify character and leadership potential with a high degree of success.   Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government?s stated requirements.  All responses should be submitted to Ms. Christine L. Hazlett (202) 767-8021, christine.hazlett@bolling.af.mil.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) this notice serves as a request for information. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research.

In the initial study the contractor will be required to develop and deliver a single instrument that would be used to accurately measure innate, targeted personality traits that are indicators of the leadership potential desired in future Air Force leaders.  The contractor will conduct interviews with select senior Air Force leaders to help inform them on desired traits; conduct a validation study to demonstrate their ability to assess recruits for integrity, character and leadership potential with a high degree of accuracy.  The next phase of the program includes delivery of a sustainable interview instrument that will be used by the Air Force for selected accession screening.  Contractors must demonstrate they have extensive experience and exceptional past performance in the area of human psychology testing and interview screening that is defensible even in court if a candidate challenges the screening process.  The critical competency required for this effort is the demonstrable capability the contractor has previously developed to understand and accurately measure the character and leadership traits inherent in very successful leaders.    
Respondents to this RFI should provide a brief qualifications and capability package (not to exceed 10 pages).  Also include information such as: Company name, address, email, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business?

(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure. This is an RFI only and all information received will be for marketing purposes. All communication regarding this RFI, including submissions, should be in writing and submitted in a commonly used format electronically. Interested respondents having questions with respect to the information requested in the RFI should direct them in electronic format only to Ms. Christine L. Hazlett, at christine.hazlett@bolling.af.mil. Telephone inquiries, questions, and/or comments will not be accepted, and a response may not be provided.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT AN OFFER. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY ANY COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION OF ANY SUBMISSION TO THIS MARKET SURVEY, OR TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES. 

Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes non-personal services in the areas of marine engineering, naval architecture, electrical and electronics engineering, maintenance engineering, shipboard testing, and failure analysis. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for the T-AOE 6 Class Machinery Control System will be issued within the next several months by MSC. Prior to issuing the RFP, MSC must verify if potential offerors are in compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). In accordance with Title 22 from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Sections 120-130, ITAR is a set of United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List. These regulations implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act, and are described in Title 22 (Foreign Relations), Chapter I (Department of State), Subchapter M of the Code of Federal Regulations.  

The upcoming solicitation will not contain technical data subject to the ITAR and may be exported to foreign persons. However, the T-AOE 6 Class Machinery Control System equipment and the Government Furnished Information (GFI) are considered to be defense articles subject to ITAR, therefore potential offerors which intend to export or to temporarily import a defense article must obtain the approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) prior to the export or temporary import.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS, intends to negotiate with the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA to provide  services for the Modification and Testing of the Precipitation Estimation using Remotely Sensed Information from Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN) Algorithm on Advanced Baseline Imager (ASBI) Data. Radiance information in the visible, infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate rainfall for decades, first using manual techniques and more recently via fully automated retrieval algorithms.  Improvement in satellite-based instrumentation and the development of more advanced algorithms  progress has been made in increasing the skill of these estimates. The potential for further improvement to these rainfall estimates is anticipated with the introduction of the advanced baseline imager (ABI) on board the GOES-R generation of platforms beginning in the next decade. Several techniques for estimating rainfall and now castings  brightness temperature fields will be incorporated into the operational GOES-R ground processing system to produce these Environmental Data Records. One of the techniques is the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) algorithm developed at the University of California at Irvine. PERSIANN uses artificial neural networks to develop and update relationships between GOES-measured parameters and rainfall rates derived from microwave data in order to produce high-quality estimates of  rainfall than would be possible using GOES data alone. The Objectives of this task will be to modify PERSIANN as needed to take advantage of the Advanced Baseline Imager brightness temperatures to the Hydrology Algorithm Team for evaluation. Deliverables: 1) Spatial fields of estimated rain rate derived from SEVIRI data (as a proxy for ABI) and microwave rainfall rates that have previously been provided the  Hydrology Algorithm Team. 2) As needed, documentation describing the provided SERVIRI forecast fields and any caveats that should be noted when evaluating the data. 3) If PERSIANN will be provided along with accompanying documentation. Assistance will also be provided as needed in implementing the code at NESDIS and in modifying the source code and producing documentation to meet Algorithm  Working Group AWG coding and documentation standard.  4) Monthly progress reports describing accomplishments, planned work, and any difficulties encountered.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K) NAICS 611310. Interested persons may identify their interest and must demonstrate their capability in order to be considered for the opportunity. This is not a request for competitive proposal. No competitive solicitation is planned, information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not to open up to competitive procedures. Note 22 applies.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CEDI_MAC_2007-JW
<RESPDATE>082307
<ARCHDATE>09072007
<CONTACT>John Webster, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-7229, Fax 410-786-9922, Email John.Webster@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) to develop a Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) front-end application for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) claims processing contractors.     

Currently, front-end Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) processing for DME claims occurs in 4 separate systems. Two of these systems are operated by DME MACs and two are operated by data services contractors under direct contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The front-end EDI systems perform edits on incoming Medicare DME claims and forwards the output data from transactions that pass edits to the core of the VMS shared system claims processing environment. Each of the 4 systems used for DME front-end transaction processing has been developed as a proprietary system to meet its developer?s own business objectives. Logic specific to Medicare requirements was added to accommodate the Medicare claims transactions.  Also, these EDI environments accept data files from the VMS shared system processing to create transactions to be sent to EDI trading partners (e.g., banks, suppliers, providers, other CMS contractors), in the form of claims payment remittance advice transactions and claims status response transactions.  The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) transactions currently passes through an exchange with VMS for both inbound and outbound transactions.

Since each system is owned and developed by separate entities, variations exist in the way in which individual front-end systems process claims and in the results they produce. Accordingly, the results of transaction editing can vary from system to system for a given transaction type and can result in similar transactions being rejected by some systems while being approved by others. This creates confusion with suppliers and beneficiaries. It can also lead to the rejection of eligible claims as well as the payment of ineligible claims depending upon which front-end system processed the transaction.

The CEDI DME MAC front-end system shall be discrete to the contractor and shall not be integrated with any other commercial application and processing environment. The primary functions of the CEDI DME MAC front-end system generally will include: 
	
-	An electronic mailbox system for suppliers to submit claims as well as offer customer support; 
-	Conducts EDI translation activities for all ANSI ASC X12 4010A1 files and future versions adopted by Federal regulation promulgated by DHHS and/or CMS.  The use of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software is preferred, but optional, at contract award; however, the use of COTS software is required before contract option year 2.
-	NCPDP Routing and translation services (optional at contract award but required before contract option year 1);
-	Connectivity support for EDI users;
-	EDI enrollment; 
-	Free Billing Software (FBS) distribution and support; 
-	Submitter profile changes and updates;
-	Transaction testing; 
-	EDI helpdesk support; and 
-	Misdirected claims and acknowledgement transfer service between the 4 DME MACs.

In order to be considered for this requirement an offeror:

-	must be able to demonstrate their experience with, and have current and direct access to, VMS shared system claims processing environment.  

-	must currently process DME claims for adjudication and payment in an active production EDI environment.  

There are no exceptions to the requirements listed under the first two bullet points; offerors who do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.  

-	must possess, at the minimum, Capability Maturity Model? Integration (CMMI) Level II accreditation at contract award.  The offeror must be able to achieve CMMI Level III accreditation before contract option year 2.

-	must be able to determine the best approach for transitioning the workload (68,850,000 annual claims) from the current four DME MAC front-end systems.  

-	must have existing EDI staff familiar with Medicare front-end systems, or show the ability to recruit and train new staff within a short time period of time, in order to perform the functions described in this Sources Sought Notice.  The CEDI system must be fully operational for all DME MAC claims in approximately four months from date of award.

b.       Company Name 
c.       Company Address

Background  
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is an Air Combat Command installation located in Southern Arizona within the city limits of Tucson.  The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) is a one-of-a-kind specialized facility within the Air Force Materiel Command structure. AMARG provides critical aerospace maintenance and regeneration capabilities for Joint and Allied/Coalition warfighters in support of global operations and agile combat support for a wide range of military operations.  

The P3 effort is reviewing supply functions within the AMARG.  The mission of the service provider is to adopt a positive approach for Team AMARG by providing best value Supply Operations through innovation and continuous improvement. The service provider will act as a central point of supply operation while supporting the mission of AMARG, meeting the customer needs, and promoting a safe, secure, and reliable working environment. 

The activities being researched for a possible A-76 Commercial Activities competition include:

A.	Manage Commercially Available Supplies and Equipment: Receive, inventory, and distribute commercially available supplies and equipment to effectively and accurately meet customers? requirements.  Operate a centralized receiving center.

B.	Manage Non-Commercial Available Supplies: Accept and process issue requests using AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, or other automated means to ensure compliance with AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. Issue property from warehouses or establish backorders, deliver property to customers at time of issue or upon receipt of backorders from the source of supply minimizing to the greatest extent possible the elapsed time between demand and delivery of the required supply items. Establish and maintain bench stocks to provide AMARG personnel with ready access to high usage expendable items. Place requisitions with AF, DoD, or other services sources of supply to satisfy demands for out-of-stock items and to establish stock levels consistent with expected future demands. Analyze stock balances to manage excesses, shortages and forecast requirements according to usage, demand and projected patterns. Safely and expeditiously load and unload vehicles, receive, in-check property shipped from sources of supply to ensure property is processed in a timely manner. Perform periodic inventories of property in storage to ensure the accuracy of accountable records. Process and file Non-Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) shipping documents from AMARG activities using the electronic document control system. Process turn-ins of serviceable, condemned and unserviceable supplies and equipment.  

C.	Manage Supplies Containing Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT): Manage the use and distribution of hazardous materials IAW AMARG?s Hazardous Materials Management Process (HMMP) Plan. Track all supplies containing HAZMAT used on the AMARG facility, from the time the supplies are requested until they are properly disposed of. Review requests for supplies containing HAZMAT to ensure proper authorization has been received prior to issue. Utilize the standard AF supply systems to requisition, receive, store, issue, inspect and distribute supplies containing HAZMAT and to maintain control of hazardous materials. Operate a central receiving point for all supplies containing HAZMAT brought on to the AMARG facility that are procured through other than standard AF supply system channels. Store and handle property in a manner that is safe, secure and in compliance with environmental directives. Analyze stock balances to manage excesses and shortages and forecast requirements according to usage, demand and projected patterns. 

D.	Manage Equipment: Manage equipment reportable through the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) using the standard AF Supply system and AFEMS.  Validate and process authorizations, requisitions, receipts, storage, issues, inspections, distributions, maintain custody receipt jacket files and initiate corrective action on excess in-use equipment, to ensure the accuracy of records and provide visibility of AFEMS reportable equipment used in AMARG. 

E.	Operate Standard Air Force Information Systems Related to Supply Operations: Process required transactions and reports for the following standard information systems IAW AF directives to ensure accuracy of databases, proper maintenance of accountable records and reliable interchange of information with other AF or DoD systems.

F.	Provide Supply Operations Automated Information Systems (AIS) Support.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Good Mobile Defense
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires 300 Good Mobile Defense Extended Variable technical support. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Good Technology Inc, 4250 Burton Dr., Santa Clara, CA 95054. Interested parties may e-mail nathan.bowles@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, SrA Nathan Bowles, not later than Monday 14 August, 2007; 10:00 a.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within six days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
United States Special Operations Command believes that award to any other source would result in substantial cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Good Mobile Defense is a deployed capability supporting the wireless technology at various USSOCOM enterprise locations. This technology will be replaced by new technology to be released late in 2008 by DOD; USSOCOM has a requirement to sustain security controls on these devices until they are replaced with the new technology. The cost of implementing new technology and trying to disperse it across the enterprise would not be feasible or cost effective for the amount of time required to maintain this license agreement. Accordingly, Good Technology is the only firm capable of providing the maintenance described without the U.S. Government experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.
This signifies the only notice for resulting award which will be made upon closing pending any responses received and per FAR 52.232-19 Availabilty of Funds For the Next Fiscal Year.

<SUBJECT>58 -- INDUSTRY DAY FOR A-10 CONTROL DISPLAY UNIT
<DESC>A10 Control Display Unit Industry Day 28 & 29 August 2007, 0900-1500 Club Hill Hill AFB Utah
Day 1: Contemplated Project Parameters etc briefing by Hill AFB Program and Acquisition Center of Excellence

Day 2: 30 Minute one on one with each interested vendor.  Sign up for times with Lori Lloyd at the time of conference registration.


     A10 Control Display Unit (CDU), The Air Force is contemplating a project to re-engineer the A-10 CDU using Form, Fit and Function (F3I) to replace the existing CDU with a more reliable, longer life CDU that has a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5,000 hours. The Air Force plans for the re-engineered CDU  include production articles.  This production may range between 14 to 420 units, to be determined by the reliability of the existing CDU.  The engineering services include; prototype development and fabrication, bench, system integration, flight testing, technical data suitable for reprocurement and technical order maintenance The F3I procedure encourages the procurement of items using performance based acquisition specifications versus build -to- print requirements.  This procurement/services will be based on ?Best Value? to the government, not necessarily requirements.  The CDU will incorporate state of the art technology and will be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function, and interface equivalence.  The government does not own the current drawings nor the interface requirements of the current operating system.  Because this is a F3I proposed project using Material Support Division Funding alteration of the current Operational Flight Program cannot be accomplished.  The current operating system is the intellectual property of Harris Corporation and any interested party would need to utilize the intellectual property of Harris Corporation in order to accomplish the needs of this RFI.  Similiarly the Air Force does not own the data of the current test equipment.  The interfaces that are utilized in the current test equipment are the property of Harris Corporation. It is vital that the new CDU utilize the same test station as there may be only a limited number of CDU?s ever procured. Use of the governments test set is severly restricted and availability would be on a non-interfereing basis. The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. We are seeking contractors interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability CDU using modern technology rather than traditional build to print requirements.  The new CDU will replace the current CDU (NSN 5895-01-453-5868FJ, P/N: 3003337-106).  
  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished. The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Please limit the attendees from each interested party to two individuals.  Conference fees will be 20.00 per person and will be collected on the first day. Please provide written responses electronically by 13 Aug 2007 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN:  Lori Lloyd, Bldg 1215, 6050 Gum Lane, Hill AFB, Utah 84056-5825.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Livefire Simulation Trainer (LST) and Livefire Modular Shooting Ranges (MSR) software for the Army Game Project (AGP)
<DESC>Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304 (c )(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District intends to make a sole source aw ard to a small business, Laser Shot Inc., 4214 Bluebonnet Drive, Stafford, TX 77477.  Description of supplies/Services:  The objective of this contract is to procure a follow-on non commercial highly specialized service from one source utilizing other than  full and open competition to provide for the procurement of Laser Shots Live-fire Simulation Trainer (LST) and Live-fire Modular Shooting Ranges (collectively MSR) for the immediate training needs of U.S. Army units.  Army units, particularly the Speci al Forces are placing maximum efforts to train soldiers in Urban Combat skills prior to deployment to fight the Global War on Terrorism.  The MSR system is a leap-ahead technology solution to train soldiers in a live fire situation while accurately simulat ing various combat environments by using the U.S. Army-owned Americas Army (AA) computer game software.  This AA software simulates a wide variety of geo-typical and geo-specific locations along with integrating virtual combatants and non-combatants.   Th e software has been uniquely integrated into the Laser-shot Live Fire Simulation Trainer under an agreement with the U.S. Army.  This contract action is critical to the U.S. Army training efforts because it allows soldiers to train significantly more effec tively prior to deployment with the same array of firearms and ammunition that they use in combat, improve their abilities to engage moving targets, identify threats, and reduce the incidence of friendly fire casualties.  This technology is unique and nece ssary to best prepare soldiers for their combat missions in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The contractor shall provide up to three (3) MSR systems to the Army Game Project (AGP) managed by the U.S. Military Academys Office of Economic and Manpower Anal ysis and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.  Laser Shot, Inc is the only manufacturer and retailer of these specific items.  The Contracting Officer anticipates the award of a sole source small-business set- aside, utilizing firm-fixed price (FFP) contract type. A fixed price contract will be issued on or about August 23, 2007.  No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may iden tify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a request for competition.  No telephone requests will be honored .

C.) Evaluation Factors

M.1   General
a. The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 15.

b. In accordance with FAR 52.215 1 (f), the Government intends to award contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors listed in Section M.3.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This effort will include comparing the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each offer.  

c. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with offerors except clarifications if necessary as described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors' best terms from a technical and price standpoint.

d. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.  

M.2   Basis for Award
The Government will make an award to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value based on the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.

FSA has established a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to evaluate proposals submitted for this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated by the TEB members in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR part 15, and the Evaluation Factors hereinafter described.

Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each offeror?s proposal in accordance with the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.  In determining the best value to the government after all Pass/Fail criterion are passed, the Cost and Privacy& Security are significantly more important than the Solution & Past Performance.  The price evaluation will not be point scored.  If all Pass/Fail criterion are passed then the proposal will be then considered, scored and evaluated against the evaluation factors in M.3.   
M.3   52.212-2 Evaluation ? Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

a.)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, pass/fail criterion and other factors considered. 

All of the Pass/Fail Criterion must be passed in order to be considered for further evaluation and consideration. 

The following factors will be used to evaluate offers in accordance with the following rating schedules after all Pass/Fail Criterion have been met.

i. Privacy and Security (400 pts) - The Government will evaluate the offeror?s privacy and security capabilities which will ensure 100% Government confidentiality for electronic, printed and distributed documents.  The Government will evaluate the offeror?s network security and all security measures that are available in order to ensure information is not taken out of the facility. 

The Offeror who successfully describes and addresses all areas of security and privacy which meets the Government?s requirements that are realistic, relevant and complete, will receive a higher score than offerors who fail to do so.  

ii. Solution and Past Performance (200 pts) - The Government will evaluate the quality 
control plan which should address how, in partnership with the government, the offeror will manage and mitigate project risk and project scope.  The Government will evaluate the efficiency of the process which will be most efficient to completing the required turn around times for both the Form 1099 and Disbursement Transaction Statements.  

The Government will evaluate the ease of use and content of the activity tracker and reporting systems that will be utilized to display pertinent information requested by the Government.  

The Government will evaluate past performance based on phone calls to past customers which demonstrates their capability and capacity to deliver high quality service and solutions.  The past performance evaluation will examine the Offeror?s actual performance on at least two (2) efforts.  This review will focus on the size, scope and complexity of the efforts, relevance and outcome.

The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of the Offeror?s proposal and the relative capability of the Offeror.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past performance may be considered an indication that the ability of the Offeror to perform the contract as proposed may be questionable.  An Offeror with an exceptional record of past performance will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is only acceptable.
iii. Price ? The Government will evaluate price from lowest to highest.  The lowest price will have a more favorable evaluation then a higher price. 
*Technical and past performance,when combined, are more important than price.

a.  MINOR REPAIRS:  The Government defines minor damage as any event that can be repaired for less than $500.00 and the repairs can be completed within 24 hours of discovery.  The Government will make said repairs to vehicle when the vehicle does not meet standards or it is determined to be a safety hazard.

A message left on the Contractor's Point of Contact (POC) answering machine constitutes a bona fide attempt to initiate a disabled vehicle call and the Contractor's response time begins at that point.  The Contractor may also provide a pager number, cell phone number and/or an email address to facilitate communications with the Government, which in no way relieves the Contractor of the stated requirement.  Hours for disabled vehicle recovery call coverage are 24 hours per day, seven day a week, including Federal Holidays for the full term for which this purchase order is enforceable.  There is the potential for after-hours disabled vehicle call coverage with regard to this order.  This requirement shall be provided in accordance with the terms herein and at no additional cost to the Government.  A replacement vehicle will be provided at the time the vehicle is picked up by the Contractor from the government?s possession at no additional cost to the Government.  Recoveries as a result of vehicle under repair services shall not incur usage charges for the full days that they are out-of-service, that is, unavailable for intended use.  The Contractor shall afford to Government users and their authorized passengers utilizing vehicle   covered hereunder all due consideration and relief with respect to any retrieval and/or recovery action(s) of disabled vehicle rentals, to include, the disposition and accommodation of the user and any passengers should they be stranded due to a non-operational or unsafe vehicle as is customary of the commercial vehicle rental industry.  The Contractor shall provide a POC to serve as the Contractor's principle liaison for the purpose of satisfying this requirement.  At a minimum, the contractor?s POC shall assess, record, initiate, and follow-up on disabled vehicle calls to ensure all the resolution efforts or actions are effective.  Record of any other concern, dispute, or action(s) the Contractor may invoke pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract shall be made separately or in addendum to the aforementioned documentation.   

14.  ACCIDENTS/THEFTS.  Same procedures apply as stated in Para 13-Vehicle Recovery.    If an official law enforcement report finds the government at fault for an accident  the contractor will be fully reimbursed for rental usage, towing fees, and cost damages in accordance with contracting regulations.  The same procedures must be followed as stated in Para 11.  Failure to do so indicates that the Contractor will assume liability of all damages.  Record of any other concern, dispute, or action(s) the Contractor may invoke pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract shall be made separately or in addendum to the aforementioned documentation.  Upon completion and submission to the Government of the Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss (FLIPL) and two repair estimates, the Government will make payment to the contractor for said damages.

15.  The government intends to rent the vehicle(s) under the most cost effective method.  For example, if the Government requires the vehicle(s) for three weeks and the cost of renting the vehicle for one month is less than the weekly cost for the three week period, the Government may elect to pay the monthly charge for the three week rental period.

16.  CONTRACTOR POINT OF CONTACT.  In accordance with the sections of this statement of work that identify the need for the Government to contact the vendor for purposes of having a vehicle  picked up due to non-operability, the contractor shall provide, at the time of award, a point of contact and phone number, pager number, e-mail address, etc.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Richard Bolling Federal Office Building
Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO
Project Phase: The modernization project to be completed under the project Prospectus developed for the federal building consists of a four phase project.  Phase I and Phase II of this modernization have been completed.  Phase III has completed design and has an approximate construction notice to proceed in June of 2007.  Phase IV is the future completion of the renovation project with design starting in 2008.
Approximate Area: 1.2 million gross square feet
Project Summary:
Encompassing two full city blocks in the Municipal, State and Federal government district of Kansas City, Missouri?s downtown urban core, the massive Richard Bolling Federal Building is a landmark on the city skyline and a flagship complex for GSA in the community and the region.  Built during the Great Society period in the early 1960?s, the nineteen story office tower stretches east and west across the site blocking Cherry Street in the downtown street grid.  The individual 50,000 square foot tower floor plans make it the largest high rise office building in the Kansas City metropolitan area at over 1.2 million gross square feet.

An ongoing modernization project involves complete demolition of all building core elements to include complete asbestos abatement of the buildings steel framed structure.  Improvements involve all new core construction, mechanical systems, state of the art lighting and energy management systems, tenant improvements, roof replacement, repair of air/water infiltration problems with the exterior curtain wall glazing system as well as security improvements of the building skin.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

OBJECTIVES

?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.

?	To visualize, communicate, and validate the tenant phasing schedule using 4D modeling

?	To evaluate the energy performance of proposed design options using BIM-based energy analysis.  

?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

FINAL ACCEPTANCE	
The successful quoter must repeat the tests above, prior to final acceptance by the Government.  Testing must be completed on-site at NIST after all equipment has been installed.  

NIST will accept the system only upon successful completion of delivery, installation, training and demonstration of all minimum specifications.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD
Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government after evaluation of technical factors and price.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability: Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement, 2) Past Performance, and Price.  
Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are equal in importance to price.    

TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the documentation provided in the quotation and test data.  Contractors shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all specifications, and clearly documents that the offered products meet or exceed the specifications stated above.  

Test Data submitted will be analyzed to further evaluate the ability of the system to meet the minimum specifications

In determining best value, consideration shall be given to instruments with lower position non-linearity, lower X, Y, and Z noise, and higher pixel density. 
	
In addition, the Government has a desire to obtain the following additional performance capabilities: 
-Video image capture to allow the digital capture of images recorded by the microscope;
-Digital Q control to adjust the effective cantilever Q value up or down by an order of magnitude;
-Additional electronics / control features for doing non-contact AFM with frequency based detection;
-Additional electronics / control features for doing lateral force microscopy;
-Additional electronics / control features for doing conductive atomic force microscopy;
-Capability to detect the overtones and higher harmonics of the cantilever motion, and use them for imaging;
-Additional capability of adding user defined functionality;
-Added functionality for performing lithography with the AFM;
*Provides control of the probe velocity, vertical (Z) position, applied voltage, pulse strength, and duration.
*User interface to input lithographic patterns.
If these features are available, the Contractor shall quote these features as separate items on their quotation.  While award is not contingent on these features, if quoted, the Government will consider the purchase of any or all of these features based on the value to the Government, technical merit and price considered.  

PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or information provide by NIST and its affiliates.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

<DESC>This amendment is to provide questions and answers for the requirement:
 

a.      What is the serial number of the switch?
	20085365
 

b.      Can DITCO provide a OrderPro LOG file from the switch or allow us remote access to the switch so we can extract this information?
	We can provide files, but we will not allow outside access to a vendor not listed on a maintenance contract.  We also do not use OrderPro.
 

c.      Can DITCO provide a bayface drawing of the switch that includes part numbers and releases of all cards within the switch?  This will allow us to ensure the new software is compatible with existing cards.
	Drawing can be provided.
 

d.      Please confirm that the switch is DC-Powered?  We notice the replacement CE power supplies identified in the solicitation are DC but we would like confirmation that the switch is DC powered.
	The switch is in-fact DC powered.
 

e.      Please provide an inventory of the types and quantities of auxiliary equipment associated with the switch.  For example, MIRan cards, Symposium, remotes (such as fiber, carrier, etc.)
	There will be an attached list of auxiliary equipment.
 

f.       Are there any older PE/EPE cards for lines and trunks?
	All cards are original so they are all old.
 

g.     Are there any SL-1 telephone sets or attendant consoles that operate off SL-1 line cards?
	No, all attendant consoles come directly from our line cards, not SL-1.  
 

h.      Is it the desire of DITCO to convert the existing MMail Module to an IPE Module?  Is this module DC-powered?
	DITCO wants MMail replaced with the new Nortel Call Pilot 4.0 Must be D/C Powered.
 

i.       Is it the desire of DITCO to convert the IGM Module to an IPE Module?  Is this module DC-powered?
	Yes, and Yes.
 

j.       Is there an existing IP media card?  The list of material does not add a IP media card so we assume one already exists in the switch.  What is the part number and release version of this card?
	DITCO does not currently have an IP Card, however we would like to eventually explore VoIP and would like to have that capability after the upgrade has been completed.
 

k.      How many signaling servers are there?  There is one identified in the parts list but is there already one on-site.  If so, what firmware release is on it?
	There is only one signaling server.
 

l.       What are the facility access requirements?  We know the base access requirements but it DITCO has access requirements above and beyond these we need to know those.
	
Ref: DOD Industrial Security Regulation http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/522022m.htm
1.  Frequently I am asked about getting official visitors onto base and into building 3600.  Below are instructions for both. 

2. If your visitor does not have a CAC and a decal to get onto base, you will need to call the front gate from an ON BASE telephone and sponsor them through the gate. The number for the Shiloh gate is:  256-6663.  Make sure you tell your visitor that they will need a current insurance card, current driver's license or other picture ID, and a current vehicle registration or rental contract.  Also be sure to give them directions to the building and make sure they know where to park when they get here.

3. Personnel without a security clearance:  If they do not have a security clearance, then they will have to be escorted by you or another DITCO employee with a picture badge at all times (visitors cannot escort visitors).  I would like to get an email from you telling me that you expect them, the date, and their names, but it is not necessary for them to submit a Visit Access Request or Letter (VAR or VAL) to me since they do not have a clearance to verify.

4.  If they are DISA military, government or contractor:  Instruct them to bring their DISA badge with them as identification for building access.  They will be issued a visitor badge at the security window.  Again, I would like a heads up in the form of an email from you telling me you are expecting DISA visitors, their names and the date of their arrival.

5.  If they hold a security clearance, but do not work for DISA:  Several days before their visit, their security manager will need to fax a completed VAR/L to CML 618-229-9698 DSN 779-9698 (DITCO Security office). Additionally, visit requests can be submitted via JPAS to SMO code: DKADAL.  Information to include is below.

6.  There is no "form" for a VAR/L (a DISA Form 43 is for DISA's use only).  The content of a VAR/L is covered in the Industrial Security Regulation, DOD 5220.22-M or in the DOD Physical Security Regulation 5200.8-R. A VAR/L requesting unescorted access to DITCO must include the following information:  

        a. Agency/Company name and address 
        b. Name and address of facility to be visited (DITCO, 2300 East Dr., Scott AFB, IL 62225)
        c. Date(s) of visit 
        d. Purpose of visit (Why are they coming to DITCO?) 
        e. Contract number (if applicable)
        f. Hosting facility POC?s full name and telephone number (This would be YOU, not me, I am not their POC). 
        g. Visitor?s name, social security number, date and place of birth, citizenship, clearance data  			     (clearance level, agency who granted clearance and date granted) 
        h. Agency/Company cognizant security office name and address 
        i. Agency/Company clearance data (clearance and safeguarding levels, date granted and CAGE code) 
        j. Agency/Company security officer?s name, telephone number, signature and date
 

Just for information purposes, a review of the solicitation parts list appears to be incomplete for the following reasons:

 

a.      List of materials did not contain any JITC-Hardening parts for the switch.  This is required with Release 4.5 DSN software
	The only information that I was able to find in the JITC regarding hardening was in publication CJCSI 6212.01D (IOP & Spt IT/NSS which stated: Critical Infrastructure Protection. Actions taken to prevent, remediate, or
mitigate the risks resulting from vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure assets.
Depending on the risk, these actions could include: changes in tactics,
techniques, or procedures; adding redundancy; selection of another asset;
isolation or hardening; guarding, etc.
If there is something I missed, please send me that technical publication and I will address that question then.

 

b.      List of materials did not contain any JITC-Hardening parts for the new Call Pilot.  This is required with Release 4.0 call pilot software
	
 The only information that I was able to find in the JITC regarding hardening was in publication CJCSI 6212.01D (IOP & Spt IT/NSS which stated: Critical Infrastructure Protection. Actions taken to prevent, remediate, or
mitigate the risks resulting from vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure assets.
Depending on the risk, these actions could include: changes in tactics,
techniques, or procedures; adding redundancy; selection of another asset;
isolation or hardening; guarding, etc.
If there is something I missed, please send me that technical publication and I will address that question then.


c.      List of materials did not identify a need for Release 4.5 Nortel CDs containing the Technical Publications 
	T-PUBS will be needed.
 

d.      List of material did not identify spares.  New components are being introduced but there was no sparing of these new components.  
	No Sparing will be done as we will have a maintenance agreement with the awarded vendor.
 

e.	The List of materials adds five (5) IP telephone sets, but it does not add any IP software.  We are assuming that there are enough TNs to support these IP sets..
VoIP package was included in the initial agreement.  IP software will be needed.

 
f.	The parts list does not add any ASVALAN gear.  As the switch is going to Release 4.5 which does require JITC certified equipment for VoiP, is there any LAN gear that will connect to this switch?
Yes, there will be LAN gear attached but not at this time.

2.  NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION.  Upgrade of the Nortel Option 81c Telephone Switch System with new hardware and software located at DITCO bldg 3600, for the period 15 July 2007 - 30 September 2007.  .  A firm-fixed price award is anticipated.

3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES.  The vendor will be installing an upgrade package including hardware to the existing Option 81 PBX and its infrastructure.  New cards being installed include but are not limited to upgrades to Power Supply Cards, Ring Generator Cards, Digital and Analog Line Cards, Trunk Cards, PRI Cards, Processor Cards and ENET Cards.  A drawing designated as ?Proposed Switch Room Layout.vsd? Page-8 will be sent with this document to ensure the proper detail is achieved.

4.  IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY.  The agency?s requirement is for a specific make and model. Acquisition using other than full and open competition under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

5.  DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS.   The Vendor must have expertise in the installation, upgrades, software, operation and special operating features and testing with OPT. 81 Nortel Meridian Phone Switch, Switch View Avotus Intercontrol, Meridian Mail and Call Pilot to include the knowledge of migrating existing Meridian Mail and Data to Call Pilot. The Vendor must have intimate knowledge of the PBX equipment and performs the necessary corrective action to ensure malfunctioning equipment is restored to fully operational mode, provides the tools and expertise required to minimize impact on day-to-day operations to while providing this upgrade. If this upgrade is not completed properly, our ability to provide telephone and voice mail services to DITCO which supports the War Fighter world wide would be diminished.  The Option 81 is a Nortel Meridian model exchange and as such will be unable to accept parts and software from a vendor such as Lucent, Avaya or Cisco; they are not compatible.  A good number of the cards will be replaced to fit the new backplane, there will be a core upgrade to both the primary and secondary processors to the existing back plane, software will be upgrade to the newest version and the voice mail system will be completely upgraded from Nortel Meridian Mail to Nortel Call Pilot 4.0.

<DESC>This amendment corrects the serial number listed in amendment 1.


a.      What is the serial number of the switch?
	J00409
 

b.      Can DITCO provide a OrderPro LOG file from the switch or allow us remote access to the switch so we can extract this information?
	We can provide files, but we will not allow outside access to a vendor not listed on a maintenance contract.  We also do not use OrderPro.
 

c.      Can DITCO provide a bayface drawing of the switch that includes part numbers and releases of all cards within the switch?  This will allow us to ensure the new software is compatible with existing cards.
	Drawing can be provided.
 

d.      Please confirm that the switch is DC-Powered?  We notice the replacement CE power supplies identified in the solicitation are DC but we would like confirmation that the switch is DC powered.
	The switch is in-fact DC powered.
 

e.      Please provide an inventory of the types and quantities of auxiliary equipment associated with the switch.  For example, MIRan cards, Symposium, remotes (such as fiber, carrier, etc.)
	There will be an attached list of auxiliary equipment.
 

f.       Are there any older PE/EPE cards for lines and trunks?
	All cards are original so they are all old.
 

g.     Are there any SL-1 telephone sets or attendant consoles that operate off SL-1 line cards?
	No, all attendant consoles come directly from our line cards, not SL-1.  
 

h.      Is it the desire of DITCO to convert the existing MMail Module to an IPE Module?  Is this module DC-powered?
	DITCO wants MMail replaced with the new Nortel Call Pilot 4.0 Must be D/C Powered.
 

i.       Is it the desire of DITCO to convert the IGM Module to an IPE Module?  Is this module DC-powered?
	Yes, and Yes.
 

j.       Is there an existing IP media card?  The list of material does not add a IP media card so we assume one already exists in the switch.  What is the part number and release version of this card?
	DITCO does not currently have an IP Card, however we would like to eventually explore VoIP and would like to have that capability after the upgrade has been completed.
 

k.      How many signaling servers are there?  There is one identified in the parts list but is there already one on-site.  If so, what firmware release is on it?
	There is only one signaling server.
 

l.       What are the facility access requirements?  We know the base access requirements but it DITCO has access requirements above and beyond these we need to know those.
	
Ref: DOD Industrial Security Regulation http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/522022m.htm
1.  Frequently I am asked about getting official visitors onto base and into building 3600.  Below are instructions for both. 

2. If your visitor does not have a CAC and a decal to get onto base, you will need to call the front gate from an ON BASE telephone and sponsor them through the gate. The number for the Shiloh gate is:  256-6663.  Make sure you tell your visitor that they will need a current insurance card, current driver's license or other picture ID, and a current vehicle registration or rental contract.  Also be sure to give them directions to the building and make sure they know where to park when they get here.

3. Personnel without a security clearance:  If they do not have a security clearance, then they will have to be escorted by you or another DITCO employee with a picture badge at all times (visitors cannot escort visitors).  I would like to get an email from you telling me that you expect them, the date, and their names, but it is not necessary for them to submit a Visit Access Request or Letter (VAR or VAL) to me since they do not have a clearance to verify.

4.  If they are DISA military, government or contractor:  Instruct them to bring their DISA badge with them as identification for building access.  They will be issued a visitor badge at the security window.  Again, I would like a heads up in the form of an email from you telling me you are expecting DISA visitors, their names and the date of their arrival.

5.  If they hold a security clearance, but do not work for DISA:  Several days before their visit, their security manager will need to fax a completed VAR/L to CML 618-229-9698 DSN 779-9698 (DITCO Security office). Additionally, visit requests can be submitted via JPAS to SMO code: DKADAL.  Information to include is below.

6.  There is no "form" for a VAR/L (a DISA Form 43 is for DISA's use only).  The content of a VAR/L is covered in the Industrial Security Regulation, DOD 5220.22-M or in the DOD Physical Security Regulation 5200.8-R. A VAR/L requesting unescorted access to DITCO must include the following information:  

        a. Agency/Company name and address 
        b. Name and address of facility to be visited (DITCO, 2300 East Dr., Scott AFB, IL 62225)
        c. Date(s) of visit 
        d. Purpose of visit (Why are they coming to DITCO?) 
        e. Contract number (if applicable)
        f. Hosting facility POC?s full name and telephone number (This would be YOU, not me, I am not their POC). 
        g. Visitor?s name, social security number, date and place of birth, citizenship, clearance data  			     (clearance level, agency who granted clearance and date granted) 
        h. Agency/Company cognizant security office name and address 
        i. Agency/Company clearance data (clearance and safeguarding levels, date granted and CAGE code) 
        j. Agency/Company security officer?s name, telephone number, signature and date
 

Just for information purposes, a review of the solicitation parts list appears to be incomplete for the following reasons:

 

a.      List of materials did not contain any JITC-Hardening parts for the switch.  This is required with Release 4.5 DSN software
	The only information that I was able to find in the JITC regarding hardening was in publication CJCSI 6212.01D (IOP & Spt IT/NSS which stated: Critical Infrastructure Protection. Actions taken to prevent, remediate, or
mitigate the risks resulting from vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure assets.
Depending on the risk, these actions could include: changes in tactics,
techniques, or procedures; adding redundancy; selection of another asset;
isolation or hardening; guarding, etc.
If there is something I missed, please send me that technical publication and I will address that question then.

 

b.      List of materials did not contain any JITC-Hardening parts for the new Call Pilot.  This is required with Release 4.0 call pilot software
	
 The only information that I was able to find in the JITC regarding hardening was in publication CJCSI 6212.01D (IOP & Spt IT/NSS which stated: Critical Infrastructure Protection. Actions taken to prevent, remediate, or
mitigate the risks resulting from vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure assets.
Depending on the risk, these actions could include: changes in tactics,
techniques, or procedures; adding redundancy; selection of another asset;
isolation or hardening; guarding, etc.
If there is something I missed, please send me that technical publication and I will address that question then.


c.      List of materials did not identify a need for Release 4.5 Nortel CDs containing the Technical Publications 
	T-PUBS will be needed.
 

d.      List of material did not identify spares.  New components are being introduced but there was no sparing of these new components.  
	No Sparing will be done as we will have a maintenance agreement with the awarded vendor.
 

e.	The List of materials adds five (5) IP telephone sets, but it does not add any IP software.  We are assuming that there are enough TNs to support these IP sets..
VoIP package was included in the initial agreement.  IP software will be needed.

 
f.	The parts list does not add any ASVALAN gear.  As the switch is going to Release 4.5 which does require JITC certified equipment for VoiP, is there any LAN gear that will connect to this switch?
Yes, there will be LAN gear attached but not at this time.

SITE VISIT MINUTES
FOR
F3G0AB7127A100
Projectors/Lamps

MEETING TOPIC: Mission requirements and security restrictions of providing a projector system with audio and visual presentations.

DATE: 2 AUG 2007

The purpose of this site visit was to gain knowledge of mission requirements and allow contractors to ask questions in order to supply the best value product to the 561st Joint Tactics Squadron. In addition, contractors were given the opportunity to obtain measurements of the conference room, existing electrical circuit breakers, doorways and upcoming demolition of a wall to increase the area of the room.

Lt Sean Blair and SrA Paul Sanders met contractors at the visitor?s center on Craig Road. A 15 passenger van was utilized to transport contractors to 5490 Pease Drive, Bldg 1114. 

Once at Bldg 1114, I signed contractors in and informed them of security requirements that restrict cell phones, PDA?s, etc to pass through the entryway to the compound. Major Santos then escorted us through the building to the appropriate room where the installation will take place. An infrastructure representative with a camera was present throughout the meeting.

Major Santos started the meeting by displaying a map of the building and the particular room we were in. This briefing room will be used to brief distinguished visitors, so quality is a determining factor for award.

Major Santos mentioned that the west wall of the room will be demolished expanding the room from 17? x 21? to 25? x 21?. A contractor asked when the renovation would take place. Major Santos & Lt Blair stated that they will take construction time into consideration in the performance of this project, and expect to receive quotations now so that the projector project can immediately begin as soon as the wall is down. The projection screen was to go on the wall behind the west wall with consideration of the circuit breaker box in the center of the wall. A suggestion was made to project the images on the east wall. Major Santos and the Infrastructor rep agreed and the installation location was changed to the east wall.

Major Santos explained that he wanted 2 projectors and 2 screens to have the ability to display an image of classified video and unclassified video meshed together or 2 classified videos displayed simultaneously in the standard briefing room. He also expressed his desire to play DVD?s, CD?s, etc. CPU?s must be 3? apart per regulations as stated by Maj Santos. The 2 projectors need not be separated by 3?.

Lt Blair raised a question of using wireless keyboards, mice, clickers, etc because of mission control security issues. Major Santos nor the Infrastructor rep knew. SrA Sanders agreed to contact the comm squadron and supply contractors and provide Major Santos an answer by COB 3 August 2007.

Further discussion of the matrix switcher led to the desire to plug in a laptop to a podium station. Also, the audio controls need to be separated in it?s own stand at least 3? from the podium. Stereo requires quality speakers. The podium as stated by Major Santos is to be a stationary object due to the wires hooking up the equipment at the podium. The option of having a small screen in the podium for the briefer to use was discussed; preferably recessed in the podium to prevent the briefer from having to look around the monitor to view the audience seated at the roundtable. Major Santos would like contractors to provide a screen for the podium and install it, but not supply the 2 CPU?s.

Major Santos consulted the Infrastructure rep and determined that no microphones are needed or requested for this project due to the small room size.

A contractor asked if the 561st wants 1 main picture or 2 pictures. Major Santos stated he would like the ability to switch between multiple videos by the operator at the podium as well as a station at the roundtable in the center of the room as an option.

Lt Blair asked if contractors are expected to buy computers or would the 561st be supplying the computers. Major Santos said that the 561st will supply computers.

A contractor asked if they were to provide power sources for the projectors and computers. Major Santos stated contractors would supply the power source.

Major Santos stated that he would like the screens fixed to the wall with the possibility of electrically controlled up and down. Contractors were requested to supply quotes in an optional CLIN for this by Lt Blair.

It was advised by a contractor that using florescent light will have a negative effect on the picture quality and suggested the 3 lights closest to the screens be placed on their own switch in order to turn them off while presenting video/picture displays. Major Santos said that the 561st would like a projector that is brighter than the one they currently use to be able to see images such as road maps. The size of the screens was agreed upon by Major Santos to be 60X80 for both screens. Current projector model is: Epson Powerlite 820.

Lt Blair asked Major Santos about manning in the building in evening hours and weekends. A contractor asked what the earliest time of the day would be for them to start work. The start time was decided by Major Santos to be no earlier than 0730. Contractors mentioned that installation of the entire projector project will be no more than one week.

Lt Blair asked contractors to specify what is involved in quarterly cleanings in their proposals. Major Santos stated that he would like the warranty for maintenance to include next business day repairs.

A contractor asked what the due date was for quotes. I stated that the 14th of August would remain unless all present had a need for more time, in which it would be open for discussion. No contractor verbalized a need for additional time and said that they only needed a couple of days  to submit a quote and the 14th was sufficient. Quotes remain due by 14 August 2007. Also, the means of supplying a quote was questioned. My response, backed by Lt Blair, was that electronic via e-mail was the best method, but I would accept postal mail or facsimilie.

<DESC>Amendment 4 is hereby issued for the following reasons:

To provide a response to the questions listed below.  The Government's response/answer is provided after each question.

1) In the technical requirements, keypad entry of a DSC Test Message is cited. We are requesting a clarification or more specific definition of this requirement, or an example of the "test message".

Government Response:

The test message is the standard DSC Test Call, per ITU 493.
 
2) In the technical requirements, several audio interfaces for remotes, microphones, VDR are specified. We would appreciate further clarification regarding these audio interfaces. At a minimum,
 
a) Which or how many of these audio interfaces need to be active on a simultaneous basis? 
 
Government Response: 

All the interfaces need to be active simultaneously.  The VDR interface needs to continuously recording both the transmit and receive audio, at all times.  The interface to the remote stations need to fully functional at all times.  If used, the interface to the crew communications system needs to be operational at all times.
 
b) Does the USCG desire or require Squelch Adjustment to be applied to the VDR line?  

Government Response:

Squelch is not required on the VDR line.
 
3) Regarding Class A specific deliverables and ?per unit" pricing;

 a) Are ALL Class A VHF units to be delivered with a 120VAC power supply?
 
Government Response:

If the unit uses a external power supply for 120 VAC, recommend that the 120VAC power supply be priced separately. 
 
b) Are ALL Remote units to be delivered with a 120VAC power supply? 

Government Response: 

If the unit uses a external power supply for 120 VAC, recommend that the 120VAC power supply be priced separately.
 
c) Will ALL Remote units require a 175 foot cable with connectors to be supplied?

Government Response: 

No, this is the worst case situation; other installation will require a shorter cable.
 
d) ) Is there an estimate of the quantity requirement for Remote Class A units versus Primary Radios ?

Government Response: 

The Coast Guard desires that there be one radio Class A radio.  The Class A radio shall have the capability of using a minimum of one or no remote station.

4) Regarding Class D specific deliverables and "per unit pricing";   

a) Will ALL Class D radio installations require Remote units? 

Government Response:

Per requirement number 7 of the Class D radio requires a remote capability

5) The USCG specifies that the Class A will have simultaneous Channel 70 DSC receive capability, indicating a requirement for two antenna ports. Yet, the Class D requirement does not specify the same level of simultaneous Receive requirement.

a) The question is that since both Class A and Class D require two receivers of which one is dedicated to channel 70 DSC, and the general vision of Class D installations being for smaller vessels, does the USCG require a Single antenna port for Class D?

Government Response: 

Yes

b) Alternately, will the USCG accept two antenna ports on Class D radios?

Government Response: 

A single antenna is desired on the Class D radio.

 
6) In attachment II, item J, the USCG discusses Waterproof Remote Speakers and Remote microphones.
 
a) Is there an estimated quantity of Remote speakers that are required with Class A and Class D radios?
 
Government Response:  

Each radio with a remote station will require a remote speaker and microphone.  Note that the remote speaker may be integral to the remote station.

 7) Regarding IEC 529, level 4 waterproof requirements, will the USCG accept external waterproof covers?
 
Government Response:

Covers may be used, provided that they do not impede operations of the unit and that the unit can withstand the IPx4 level of exposure per IEC 529.

As a result of the above, the closing date is hereby modified to 10 August 2007 at 1700 (5:00 PM)in lieu of 09 August 2007 at 1400 (2:00 PM).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  Richard Bolling Federal Office Building
Building Type: Federal Building
Location:  Kansas City, MO
Project Phase: The modernization project to be completed under the project Prospectus developed for the federal building consists of a four phase project.  Phase I and Phase II of this modernization have been completed.  Phase III has completed design and has an approximate construction notice to proceed in June of 2007.  Phase IV is the future completion of the renovation project with design starting in 2008.
Approximate Area: 1.2 million gross square feet
Project Summary:
Encompassing two full city blocks in the Municipal, State and Federal government district of Kansas City, Missouri?s downtown urban core, the massive Richard Bolling Federal Building is a landmark on the city skyline and a flagship complex for GSA in the community and the region.  Built during the Great Society period in the early 1960?s, the nineteen story office tower stretches east and west across the site blocking Cherry Street in the downtown street grid.  The individual 50,000 square foot tower floor plans make it the largest high rise office building in the Kansas City metropolitan area at over 1.2 million gross square feet.

An ongoing modernization project involves complete demolition of all building core elements to include complete asbestos abatement of the buildings steel framed structure.  Improvements involve all new core construction, mechanical systems, state of the art lighting and energy management systems, tenant improvements, roof replacement, repair of air/water infiltration problems with the exterior curtain wall glazing system as well as security improvements of the building skin.

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

OBJECTIVES

?	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.

?	To visualize, communicate, and validate the tenant phasing schedule using 4D modeling

?	To evaluate the energy performance of proposed design options using BIM-based energy analysis.  

?	To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

?	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.
