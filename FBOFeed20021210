<DESC>NASA/GRC hereby issues a combined synopsis/Request for Offer (RFO) for: 3rd Generation Access to Space Reusable Launch Vehicle Airbreathing Propulsion System Inlet Analysis and Design Introduction: Future reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) will use airbreathing propulsion to augment rocket propulsion systems for access to space applications.  One of NASA’s Advanced Space Transportation Program goals is to develop a third generation human-rated RLV by the year 2025.   Glenn Research Center is actively developing airbreathing propulsion systems to meet this goal.  Currently, two airbreathing propulsion systems are being considered for use:  (1) Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engines that use ducted rockets combined with airbreathing ram/scramjets to augment rocket propulsion, and (2) Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) engines that use an airbreathing gas turbine engine combined with an airbreathing ram/scramjet to augment rocket propulsion.	Currently, multiple vehicle concepts are being considered as the third generation access to space vision vehicle.  One concept considers a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle that uses a RBCC or TBCC airbreathing propulsion system, while alternate vehicle concepts are considering a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicle whose first stage may use a gas turbine propulsion system while the second stage may use a RBCC propulsion system.  The Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch is developing the inlet systems for the airbreathing propulsion flow paths on each of these vehicle concepts.  At this time, the Inlet Branch is actively designing an inlet system for the proposed X-43B research flight vehicle, and the Inlet Branch anticipates supporting the TSTO gas turbine flow path inlet design in the near future.  Also, the Inlet Branch is assisting an industry effort to develop an inlet for an RBCC concept.  For both of these efforts, the NASA Glenn Research Center is seeking technical assistance for the design and analysis of these inlets. Background The mission focus of this contract is access to space.  Turbine based combined cycles offer high specific impulse (&gt; 600 sec) but usually have high dry weight fraction delivered compared to rockets and rocket-based combined cycles. Turbine accelerators can be used in a combined cycle with a ramjet/scramjet for a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable launch vehicle (RLV) or with a ramjet or afterburner as the first stage in a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) RLV using rockets or a rocket-based combined cycle for the second stage. NASA's Hyper-X flight demonstration vehicle’s technology is traceable to a subscale SSTO vehicle, while many third generation RLV concepts are TSTO. This statement of work is for a task order contract to be awarded by NASA Glenn Research Center under the management of the Turbomachinery & Propulsion Systems Division’s Inlet Branch. The inlet development efforts funded by this task order contract directly supports the Propulsion Research and Technology project (PR&T), the Revolutionary Turbine Accelerator (RTA) project, and the Integrated Systems Test of an Airbreathing Rocket (ISTAR) project.  These projects are sponsored by NASA's Aerospace Technology Enterprise under the Advanced Space Transportation Program, as part of the Space Transportation Research leading to a 3rd Generation RLV. The project supports the Access to Space goal of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise strategic plan. The duration of this effort is expected to last four years and multiple awards are anticipated. The Advanced Space Transportation Program has selected a hydrocarbon-fueled rocket based combined cycle engine for subscale ground demonstration in 2006-7. In 2004, they plan to select a second engine cycle for subscale ground tests in 2008.  In 2008-9, NASA plans to flight test an X-43B – like vehicle, a subscale hydrocarbon fueled derivative of the hydrogen-fueled Hyper-X flight vehicle.  The subscale flight vehicle will be airdropped from a B-52 and accelerated to Mach 7 to demonstrate ramjet/scramjet transition from low to high Mach numbers.  Various options are being considered for the accelerator. One option is the hydrocarbon fueled RBCC, another involves a turbine engine integrated with the ramjet/scramjet in an over/under configuration with separate inlet and exhaust from the ramjet/scramjet. A second round of subscale flight tests could be conducted in 2010-2011. Full scale ground demonstrations and flight tests are envisioned after 2015 under NASA's Advanced Space Transportation Program (ASTP).	These ground demonstrations would be in support of the 2025 goal of a third generation human-rated RLV with $ 100/lb launch costs, improved safety (1 in 1,000,000 flight catastrophic failure), and airline-like operations (2,000 flights per year fleet average and one day turn-around per vehicle).  Objectives The primary objective of this contract activity is to provide technical assistance to the Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch staff for airbreathing inlet systems design and analysis in support of the NASA ASTP access to space initiative.  This includes the Revolutionary Turbine Accelerator (RTA) project that focuses on TBCC propulsion systems and the ISTAR project that focuses on RBCC propulsion systems.  At this time, the Inlet Branch is actively developing inlet systems for the proposed X-43B research flight vehicle (both RTA and ISTAR), and the Inlet Branch anticipates supporting the TSTO gas turbine flow path inlet development effort in the near future. To this end, the NASA Glenn Research Center is seeking technical assistance for the design and analysis of these inlets.  For the RTA inlet development effort, anticipated tasks for this effort will include, but are not limited to:   (1)	  Inlet sizing/gas turbine engine mass flow matching studies.  (2)        Preliminary and detailed aerodynamic design of gas turbine inlet systems for Mach 0 to 4 operation with appropriate flow control to maximize inlet performance and operability over the operational Mach number range.  (3)	Development of inlet design techniques to mitigate inlet performance loss due to vehicle forebody boundary layer ingestion.  (4)        Preliminary definition and design of inlet mechanical variable geometry actuation mechanisms with an emphasis on vehicle/propulsion system inlet integration.  (5)      Extensive use of Two-Dimensional (2D) and Three-Dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a design and analysis tool to guide the inlet design process and refine candidate inlet designs. (6)	 Use of sophisticated 3D CFD tools to conduct end-to-end analysis of vehicle/integrated inlet systems. (7)	Development and application of sophisticated CFD tools to conduct time accurate analysis of TBCC propulsion system mode transition. (8)  Research support for wind tunnel testing of inlet systems.  Assist Glenn Research Center engineers in defining testing research objectives and assist in the actual testing process. For the ISTAR inlet development effort, anticipated tasks for this effort will include, but are not limited to:   (1)     Provide expert consultation on the development of hypersonic inlets for the ISTAR vehicle.  Consultation shall draw upon extensive knowledge of previous supersonic and hypersonic inlet development.  Operability, (shock stability or isolation techniques), are a particular are of emphasis for ISTAR.  Consultation will largely involve participation on teleconferences, technical meetings and providing informal reports and guidance on the progress of the project.  (2)	  Identify testing and analysis opportunities for the contractor and the NASA personnel to add value to the ISTAR inlet development effort.  This task may include formal proposals for test planning, analyses of existing data and test support should a inlet testing element develop. Special Requirements/Surveillance Plan The proposed tasks of this research effort will be worked concurrently by Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch staff and the chosen contractor(s).  1.	 It is expected that the contractor(s) will have frequent communication with Glenn Research Center Inlet Branch staff in order to facilitate technology exchange between the two parties in the form of daily, weekly, or bi-weekly Glenn Research Center on-site meetings, as appropriate.  Any company that wishes to participate in this effort must address how they plan to meet this requirement to be considered for selection. 2.	   An oral midterm report and written summary shall be presented at NASA Glenn. 3. Final oral and written summary reports shall be presented at NASA Glenn. Any prospective company that intends to bid on the individual tasks of this contract effort must submit documentation that verifies the principal investigators identified to support this effort have the technical background and expertise to perform the various tasks.	The principal investigators must have demonstrated extensive experience in supersonic and hypersonic inlet design and analysis for high Mach number propulsion systems.  In addition, the principal investigators for the CFD portion of the effort must have extensive specific CFD experience in the area of supersonic and/or hypersonic inlet analysis and propulsion/airframe integration.  As a minimum, each company must submit relevant curricula vitae for each of the principal investigators identified to support this effort. Deliverables The deliverables will vary as necessary according to the needs of each task written under this contract.  However, the following deliverables are required for each task unless otherwise exempted in the task description: 1.   Oral midterm report that discusses task progress, schedule, and accomplishments to date.	An electronic copy of the oral midterm presentation will suffice as the written summary. 2.   Final oral report that gives an overview of the entire task with an emphasis on the technical findings and accomplishments.  The written report will be a technical report of sufficient detail so Inlet Branch personnel can assess the contractor’s performance and use the technical findings to augment ongoing 3rd Generation RLV airbreathing propulsion inlet development efforts. If required, each specific task description issued under this contract will list the additional required deliverable items.  Period of Performance The contract is expected to be awarded January 2003 and will end December 2006 for duration of four years.  The total contract award for all tasks will not exceed $4.0 million.  Multiple companies may be chosen to support this effort. A FIRM-FIXED-PRICE, TASK-ORDER CONTRACT IS CONTEMPLATED. PROPOSERS ARE ASKED TO SUBMIT SUCCINCT DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THE FOLLOWING THREE SAMPLE TASKS.  INCLUDED SHOULD BE TOP LEVEL COST PROPOSALS WHICH INCLUDE TOTAL LABOR HOURS, TOTAL DIRECT LABOR, LABOR OVERHEAD,SUBCONTRACTS, G&A AND PROFIT. THE COST FOR EACH SAMPLE TASK SHOULD BE, IN THE PROPOSER'S OPINION, APPROPRIATE FOR THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED AND NEED NOT APPROXIMATE THE CONTRACT'S MAXIMUM VALUE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD TO THE OFFEROR(S)WHOSE PROPOSAL PROVIDES THE BEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE BEST VALUE ANALYSIS WILL WILL INCLUDE BUT WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S EVALUATION OF THE THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE KEY PERSONNEL AND THE INNOVATIVENESS AND PRACTICALITY OF THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF THE INLETS.  THE GOVERNMENT MAY AWARD TO AN OFFEROR WHOSE PROPOSAL IS SUFFICIENTLY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN LOWER PRICED PROPOSALS SO AS TO JUSTIFY PAYMENT OF THE HIGHER COST. PROPOSERS ARE REQUESTED TO SUBIT AN ORIGINAL AND TWO COPIES OF THEIR PROPOSAL TO THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT AT MS 500-306. Anticipated FY03 Task Descriptions Sample Task #1 – X-43B Air Vehicle Low Speed Inlet System Preliminary Aerodynamic Design and Analysis Inlet Branch personnel are already engaged in an inlet design activity for the low speed inlet system for the X-43B air vehicle.  This inlet system feeds the gas turbine portion of the TBCC propulsion system that is anticipated to operate from Mach 0.7 to 4.0.  The contractor shall perform the following subtasks in support of this task: 1. Develop an analytical method to conduct inlet-gas turbine engine mass flow matching studies.  This analytical method must account for the viscous losses due to forebody boundary layer ingestion and cowl-generated internal boundary layers.  This analytical method must also be robust enough to address inlet spillage considerations (no shock-on-lip inlet design).  Internal mass flow removal such as bleed must also be included in this model.  It is preferred that this analytical model run on an Excel spreadsheet and made available to NASA personnel. Deliverables:   1)  Excel spreadsheet with working analytical method, 2) Written report that describes assumptions and methodology used to construct analytical model and instructions on how to use the Excel spreadsheet. 2.  Perform a study to determine the best design approach for the X-43B low speed gas turbine inlet.  Review the baseline two-dimensional (2D) GRC inlet aerodynamic design and propose design changes to enhance the baseline inlet performance and operability. In particular the contractor shall determine the following: a.    The type of inlet design that will best meet performance and operability objectives. b. The inlet design approach.  Since the X43-B flies an accelerator mission, determine whether or not a point Mach number design is appropriate.  If a point design is recommended, address the off-design Mach number inlet performance and operability characteristics.  c.      Use analytical method developed in subtask 1 to estimate inlet capture area at discrete Mach numbers from Mach 0.7 to 4.0. d.   Based on recommendations for 2a and 2b, estimate worst case and best case inlet recoveries at discrete Mach numbers from Mach 0.7 to 4.0. Deliverables: 1) Written report that summarizes findings of this study. 3.    Perform preliminary aerodynamic and mechanical design of X-43B low speed inlet system in conjunction with NASA GRC Inlet Branch.  The contractor and Inlet Branch members will work jointly to: a.	    Determine inlet 2D internal flowpath contours at discrete Mach numbers over the anticipated flight range of Mach 0.7 to 4.0. b. Extend the baseline 2D inlet design developed in subtask 3a to three dimensions (3D) and determine mechanical requirements for variable geometry actuation.  c. Incorporate flow control and flow matching systems such as bleed, vortex generator, and overboard flow bypass doors as needed into inlet design.  d.    Ensure that the low speed inlet flowpath design will integrate into the X-43B research vehicle.   Deliverables:  1) Through the course of this subtask, the contractor shall provide aerodynamic contour geometry developed in 3a and 3b to NASA GRC to be used for timely CFD analysis of configurations.  GRC staff shall provide design input based on in-house design and analysis to refine inlet aerodynamic contours until GRC staff and the contractor agree upon a baseline aerodynamic inlet design for future study.  2) Written report that summarizes findings.  Report shall include: a) Detailed sketch of inlet concept with tabulated inlet internal flowpath coordinates at discrete Mach numbers from Mach 0.7 to 4.0, b) Detailed sketches of inlet flow control and flow matching systems with appropriate locations shown in flowpath sketch.  3) Electronic files that contain the inlet internal flowpath coordinates. Sample Task #2 – Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Support for Inlet Branch Activities The Inlet Branch routinely performs detailed analysis of various sophisticated inlet systems for airbreathing flight vehicles.  Currently, the Inlet Branch is supporting analysis of a variety of high speed inlets including the low speed inlet system for the X-43B flight test vehicle, the ISTAR dual mode ram/scramjet flowpath, and a variety of advanced supersonic inlet concepts.  The Inlet Branch is seeking a contractor to augment the Inlet Branch’s CFD analysis capabilities.  The primary task will be to provide CFD analysis support for X-43B low speed inlet development efforts.  However, as time permits, the contractor will perform timely inlet CFD analysis for other ongoing inlet development efforts within the Inlet Branch.  Because the X-43B inlet analysis effort will require close communication with both NASA and contractor staff performing task 1.3 in this Statement of Work, it is preferred that the contractor’s staff member identified to conduct this task be located on site at NASA Glenn Research Center in order to facilitate the timely exchange of information.  In addition, the contractor’s staff member will use the computational resources and infrastructure already present at NASA Glenn to expedite the CFD analysis.  Because of the nature of the task, the contractor will be funded in one year increments, and deliverables of this task will consist of timely transfer of critical CFD analyses to Inlet Branch personnel.	   Sample Task #3 – Assessment of Interim Speed stability of the ISTAR inlet The ISTAR inlet is designed to provide high speed (Mach 5 to 7) performance.  For this inlet, at interim speeds from Mach 2.5 to 5, the off-design operability remains an unknown.  By judicious application of prior analysis techniques, the contractor shall  1)  make an assessment of prior data, 2) apply supersonic inlet operability techniques to the hypersonic inlet assessment, and 3) develop a new approach if warranted. This effort will advance the state-of-the-art in interim speed operability of hypersonic inlets.	Because of the nature of the task, the contractor will be funded in one year increments, and deliverables of this task will consist of timely transfer of critical design guidance, analyses, and recommended testing approaches to Inlet Branch personnel.

<DESC>NA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Defense Acquisition Regulations System (DARS)  Information Technology Initiative  2 December, 2002 a.	Purpose.    The purpose of this request for information is to seek ideas and information from industry to support building requirements to transform the DARS from a paper-based to a technology based process.   b.	Scope.   This preliminary effort is a market research initiative to identify and assess commercially available hardware and software applications capable of supporting an end-to-end, integrated, and transparent DARS process to facilitate the generation of changes t o regulations and processes, collaboration, deliberation, coordination, approval, world-wide communication and feedback, archiving, retrieval and data management. c.  Background.   The Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DDPAP) , by delegation from the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT&L), is responsible for developing, coordinating, issuing, an d maintaining the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other Department of Defense (DoD) contracting regulations.  The DoD system of contracting regulations governs all contracting activit ies and the contractors with whom they do business. The DDPAP accomplishes this responsibility through the Defense Acquisition Regulations (DAR) System, which consists of the DARS Directorate, the DAR Council, and the DAR Committees.   The DARS Directorate is a staff office under DDPAP.  The DAR Council con sists of a policy and legal representatives from each military department, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Currently, there are 26 permanent DAR committees in specific functional areas.  Ad-hoc committees are formed to address issue of interest on an as needed basis.  Each committee includes a member from each military department, DCMA DLA, OSD and additional subject matter experts.  The DAR System includes approximately 250 members.     The DAR System is a component of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) System, which codifies and publishes uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by all executive agencies. The FAR System consists of the FAR, the primary document, and agenc y acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR.   The DoD FAR Supplement or DFARS is currently available electronically via the World Wide Web at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dp/dars/dfars.html . d.  Draft Statement of Objective The objective of this upgrade project is to obtain a “user-friendly” IT system to support the DAR System that facilitates collaboration and effective communication among all the stakeholders in the acquisition process and includes a knowledge management st ructure that will enable effective document management and permit open dissemination of information to facilitate sound business decision making.     e.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Energy:  Pursuant to FAR 6.302 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the DOE is planning a sole source contract for an independent assessment of a program management systems and practices.  The DOE Office has an immediate need to acquire the services of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), a non-profit entity.  The planned period of performance is 18 months.  NAPA is an independent, non-profit corporation chartered by Congress to identify emerging issues of governance and to help Federal, state and local governments improve their performance.  Established in 1967, NAPA contracted with the U.S. Department of Energy, EERE, and compiled a report entitled "A Review of Management in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy", dated March 2000.  The NAPA review identified numerous recommendations for improving management within the EERE.   In FY 2002 a completed reorganization of EERE was made.  The Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the House Appropriations Committee directed EERE to conduct another peer review to see if the reorganization addresses prior management issues.  It is DOE's intent to issue a sole-source, firm fixed price, task assignment contract to NAPA. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement

The Government will focus on the offeror's performance and information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the procurement under consideration.  Sources other than those identified by your company in your proposal may also be contacted/accessed by the Government, with the information received/retrieved by the Government for use in the evaluation of your company's past performance.  Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria - Demonstrated understanding of PWS requirements is the most important non-cost factor.  Other non-cost factors are of equal importance.  When combined, the non-cost factors are significantly more important than evaluated price.  However, the cost must be determined fair and reasonable and will therefore be reviewed for reasonableness.  To receive a copy of the Performance Work Statement for this requirement you may either download the attachment, or send an e-mail request (with the solicitation number on the subject line) to ybell@comdt.uscg.mil not later than December 18, 2002.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to BAE, Nashua NH for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items within the Federal Stock Class 5895 that are determined to be sole source to BAE.

A fixed price type contract is contemplated for three years with the inclusion of options to extend the contract to a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance will be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.

If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.

<SUBJECT>66--Exhaust Emissions Sampling System (CVS) for Heavy Duty Engine Dynamometer Test Cell 2
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-03-10163
<RESPDATE>122302
<ARCHDATE>01222003
<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures, the EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuel Emission Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) plans to procure a modern exhaust emissions sampling system.  The new sampling system will need to be installed in EPA?s heavy duty test cell 2.  The emissions sampling system will provide the functions of the constant volume sampler (CVS), as those functions are defined in 40 CFR 86.1310-2007.  However, the emissions sampler will have certain enhanced features.  These features include a low loss dilution tunnel and sample handling system, the direct mass flow measurement of dilution air, constant mass flow operation and proportional ambient sampling.  Flow measurement of the dilution air and dilute exhaust will be accomplished by ultrasonic flow meters.  The scope of activity in this procurement is to fabricate, deliver, and install the exhaust emissions sampling system. This capability is needed in order to test low-emission heavy-duty engines equipped with advanced exhaust emission control systems.  This capability will be used to support the technology review for the 2007 Heavy-Duty On-highway Emissions Standards, and will also be needed in order to accurately measure gaseous emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines certified to the 2007 Heavy-duty On-highway Emissions Standards.   Heavy Duty test cell 2 is an engine dynamometer test cell.  The test cell is designed to run transient and steady state exhaust emission tests on large engines, primarily diesel.  These engines are typically used in on-highway truck applications, or non-road applications such as agricultural equipment.  The engines tested in this test cell typically have rated power values from 100 to 600 HP.  The testing consists of steady mode operation as well as transient testing simulating a city or highway driving experience.  During testing, the exhaust emissions are sampled and measured along with many other parameters including actual engine power output.  Finally, emission rates are calculated to yield brake specific results or mass of emissions per unit of engine work.  Testing is conducted according to U.S. Federal Standards (40 CFR Part 86, Subpart N) and standards from other international governing bodies. The contractor shall deliver to the EPA an installed, commissioned, and acceptance tested exhaust emissions sampling system.  The contractor is responsible for the removal of all old equipment, the installation of the new system, commissioning, and training of EPA personnel. In addition, the contractor shall provide complete, detailed schematics of their systems and how the integration of all the systems and physical layout shall be facilitated.  The final design shall provide two sets of documentation, including wire lists, color coding, electrical schematics, piping/tubing diagrams, operating manuals and computer system documentation.  Operating/repair manuals for all equipment and instrumentation shall be supplied under this contract.  Recommended preventative maintenance, spare parts, and warranty provisions shall be provided in writing.  The EPA shall provide the necessary utilities, within 50 feet of the site.   The contractor, at the completion of the installation and commissioning of the exhaust emissions sampling system shall conduct acceptance testing. The statement of work is written to allow flexibility of potential solutions to meet the requirements.  While there is a certain minimum complexity required to meet the requirements, the preferred solutions ahighway truck applications, or non-road applications such as agricultural equipment.

The contractor, at the completion of the installation and commissioning of the exhaust emissions sampling system shall conduct acceptance testing. The statement of work is written to allow flexibility of potential solutions to meet the requirements.  While there is a certain minimum complexity required to meet the requirements, the preferred solutions are those which are not overly complex.  The range of possible applications of the emissions sampler can only be estimated at the present time.  The ultimate utility of such a system will depend on how easily it can be adapted to future needs.  The design philosophy therefore, should be built on the idea that every part of the system should allow for future changes, re-configuration or upgrades.  An overly complex solution or proprietary systems limit the future flexibility.   The goal of this project is for EPA to procure a simple, yet technologically advanced Exhaust Emissions Sampling System (CVS).   System Design Goals: - Size emissions sampling system to test diesel engines up to 600 HP  - System for a dilute exhaust flow range of 3,000 to 10,000 SCFM - Sample handling for low loss of particulates and gaseous emissions  - Measure dilution air directly - Operate system at constant mass flow - Provide proportional sampling of dilution air Emissions Sampler Application: The emissions sampler specification in the statement of work is an incremental improvement of constant volume sampler (CVS) designs that have been used over the past two decades.  The CVS method is a common and recognized method for determining engine mass emissions and it draws its strengths from the simplicity of its operations.  The functional, simplified description of a CVS is to collect a small sample of dilute exhaust gas and to measure the total volume of that dilute exhaust gas.  This information combined with gas concentration, measured by a separate instrument, is all that is necessary to determine mass emissions.  Fundamentally, this process will remain unchanged in this system.  The system described in the Statement of Work uses some incremental improvements to correct some problems encountered when testing large engines (up to 600 Hp) at low emissions levels.  These improvements include better sample handling, and revised flow control and flow measurement methods.   Thre those which are not overly complex.

The system described in the Statement of Work is presented both from a component function level and from a system function level.  All of the components that have been specified in the Statement of Work are commercially available.  If an offeror is aware of a better product or approach, they are encouraged to suggest these in their proposal.   Ultimately, the contractor shall deliver to the EPA an installed, commissioned, and acceptance tested exhaust emissions sampling system that meets the design and system goals.  A Maximum two (2) week on-site commissioning period needs to be allowed for in the contractors proposed schedule.  EPA will work jointly with the contractor during the commissioning period to ensure the date is met. Safety Features: Certain conditions in the test cell operation at large may require that the emissions sampler be shut down quickly.  Controls shall be designed to allow a fast shutdown of the blowers from a dedicated digital input signal supplied from an external source.   Major Systems and Physical Layout: The emissions sampler is comprised of three major systems.   A	Primary Dilution Air Processing B	Primary Dilution Tunnel C	Dilute Exhaust Processing Each system is described in the Statement of Work in detail.  The layout of these major systems is similar to designs used by EPA in the past.  The layout of the system will be done on two levels. This will include the test cell and a structural mezzanine above the test cell.  This saves a great deal of floor space on the main floor.  The primary dilution tunnel will be placed in the test cell for close proximity to the test engine.  The end of the dilution tunnel will pass through a wall into an equipment room where the sample zone will be located.  The mezzanine level will house the dilution air processing and dilute exhaust processing portions of the system. The equipment must be designed to fit into the space that is available.  The room sizes are as follows: 	Test ce system described in the Statement of Work is presented both from a component function level and from a system function level.

<DESC>Currently, the Gov’t has been managing integration of mission planning software developments and integration activities across multiple contractors and services.  The rapid growth of dozens of concurrent Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS) software developments across the services has necessitated the requirement for managing and integrating the JMPS enterprise beyond the capabilities of the current Gov’t team.  The SEIT concept for JMPS forms a distributed Gov’t & Contractor team to help manage the mission planning enterprise.   The Government is currently preparing to award a contract to an independent Systems Engineering and Integration Contractor (SIEC) to enhance the Gov’t team to support the $500M+ of upcoming developments that begin in FY04. The SEIC will not have responsibility for mission planning systems delivered to the field, rather they will be responsible for integrating the common capabilities with each other as well as to the JMPS framework. Platform Unique Planning Component (UPC) developers will be responsible for their platform’s Mission Planning Environment that will include JMPS framework, common capabilities, and the platform Unique Planning Component (UPC).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI) on behalf of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), Laboratory of Neurobiology (LM) plans to procure a AMT XR-100 CCD Bottom Mount Camera system from Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation (AMT), 3 Electronics Avenue, Danvers, MA 01923.  The NINDS Electron Microscope (EM) Facility is an Institute-wide facility providing scientists in the DIR with access to state-of-the-art electron mecoroscope equipment.  There are currently two JEOL transmission electron microscopes being used by approximately twenty-five(25) scientists.  The Facility has been generating about 10,000 micrographs a year.  Due to the personnel changes, the EM Facility no longer has a photography technician.  The proposed CCD digital camera would collect images in digital format, therefore, bypassing the conventional darkroom developing, printing and constant wait time.  The laboratory estimates that more than 90% of the users' photography needs will be met by procurement of a digital camera.  Also, the CCD Camera will make it possible for projects like serial reconstruction and tomography possible.  MINIMUM Specifications: collection of multiple images in the electron microscope; b) images collected can be directly saved at full resolution and gray scale in TIFF format directly legible in Photoshop running on an Apple Computer; c) information content of images shall be at least 2600x2600 pixels at 16 bits (>7 MB image); d) 61x61 mm phosphor detector with a field view of at least 70% the size of that with 3-1.4" film; 3) images will be magnified no more than 2X onto the surface of the phosphor which collects the image.  The above specifications are necessary to optimize the collection of EM images over the most commonly used magnification range of the microscope.  The camera lies completely outside the vacuum system.  The camera has a fast scan mode required to focus quickly on the specimen before images are collected.  The camera chip is air cooled, therefore no water connections are necessary.  Advanced Microsocpy Techniques corporation is the only known source to the NINDS researchers that can provide the aforementioned instrument.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statment and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fuly meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST (Local Washington DC time) on December 17, 2002.  This action is pursutant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchaisng Agent (301) 402-4509. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 333315 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This is a total small business set-aside.  See numbered note 1.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando - TSD (Training System Division) in Orlando, FL, intends to award a Sole Source Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) to Day & Zimmerman Services for Contractor Instruction, Maintenance, Operation and Training Support (CIMOTS) for the Cargo Offload and Discharge System (COLDS), as this is the only known source of maritime services with the unique capabilities and skills to execute these program requirements in a high-risk marine environment.  The government has determined that DZS is the only capable source through extensive market research and a lack of responses to a sources sought synopsis dated 13 Sep 2002.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed priced and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. It is anticipated that the proposed contract will be in effect for a period of 5 years including one (1) base year and four (4) one year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government as per FAR 52.217-9.   The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 561210.    Requirement Summary The requirement is to provide CIMOTS/COLDS for the Barge Ferry System at Expeditionary Warfare Training Group, Pacific (EWTGPAC) in San Diego, CA. This requirement includes instructional, maintenance, operational, and training support to produce a qualified COLDS graduate. The Contractor will be required to provide students with formal class training on-shore, followed by operation and maintenance training at sea on equipment associated with this program. The COLDS contract also supports worldwide littoral warfare contingencies for the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force. Presently, the Strategic SEALIFT Program is responsible for three Maritime Propositioning Shipping (MPS) squadrons, one each in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Each MPS squadron has enough strategic logistics to support a 17,000 Marine Expeditionary Brigade for a 30-day contingency. This strategic war and natural disaster material is comprised of rolling stock, tanks, artillery, food, water, and petroleum products. This contract is performed on both coasts for the Expeditionary Warfare Training Group Pacific San Diego, CA in actual environments using COLDS equipment. Therefore, this contract is heavily supported by the actual operating systems and material that moves Logistics Over the Shore (LOTS) for both dry and wet products from ship to shore. Because this program is mission-driven, frequently 'just-in-time' training is required. This includes classroom and open sea training. This training includes instruction for barge ferry pilots, coxswains, roll-on/roll-off discharge facility (RRDF), elevated causeway, and amphibious assault bulk fuels system, just to name a few. The government-provided equipment is used for training as well as real world operations include side-loading warping tugs, conduit training barge, offshore petroleum discharge system, barge ferry simulator, and numerous other equipment. Emerging COLDS systems are continuously being fielded that require new training, operation, and maintenance. The target contract award date for the COLDS contract will be made prior to September 2003.    

Interested parties or any contractor with questions about this notice, please contact Jennifer Warren, at 407-380-4325 or jennifer.warren@navy.mil or the procuring contracting officer, Steve Harnig at 407-380-4422 or steven.harnig@navy.mil.  If an interested party believes they are capable of performing the required services, the contracting office will coordinate a submittal of capabilities documentation for government review.  This is an announcement only regarding a sole source acquisition; there is no solicitation available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the upgrade of the RTA-852L Color Weather Radar used on the P-3 AEW and Slick aircraft prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  There is no solicitation number, for reference use USCS12102002.  The United States Customs Service (USCS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Rockwell Collins General Aviation Division, Cedar Rapids, Iowa for the upgrade of four (4) RTA-852L Color Weather Radars.  The Statement of Work is as follows: A. Background.	 The Applied Technology Division of the Office of Information and Technology (ATD/OIT) within the USCS is responsible for providing aircraft and surveillance equipment for the interdiction of drugs and other contraband destined for the United States.  The platforms for airborne surveillance and tracking used by USCS are P-3 aircraft modified for Airborne Early Warning and Interceptor/Tracker operations commonly referred to as AEW and Slick aircraft, respectively.  The Color Weather Radar (CWR) model RTA-852L manufactured by Rockwell Collins is installed on the USCS P-3 aircraft.  Recent testing and mission operations revealed that the baseline configurations were not the same and cross platform use could not be accomplished.  Configurations vary from the 622-9080-001 version to the 622-9080-011, and neither is digitally stabilized.  This upgrade will achieve baseline commonality and allow cross platform application.  B. Purpose.  It is the intent of the USCS to upgrade, with the incorporation of Rockwell Collins service bulletins, all 622-9080-001 and 622-9080-011 units to the 622-9080-003 configuration.  2.0 APPLICATION DOCUMENTS.  Commercial standards shall be used wherever practicable.  USCS requests the use of certain standards listed below because systems meeting those standards currently exist or will exist in the USCS P-3 aircraft configuration.  However, Rockwell Collins is free to propose alternative commercial standards and solutions to meet the performance requirements stipulated in this SOW.  Such proposals shall be submitted to USCS for evaluation.  All equipment shall, at a minimum, comply with commercial industry standard DO-160 produced by the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics and the ARINC-429 Digital Information Transfer System Standards, where applicable, and any other commercial industry standard. 3.0 REQUIREMENTS.  Rockwell Collins, Atlanta Service Center shall fully support, by the incorporation of service bulletins, the upgrade of the CWR RTA-852L radars as outlined in this SOW.  3.1 DETAILED TASK.  3.1.1 Equipment Upgrade.  Rockwell Collins shall provide a central point of contact (POC) to coordinate with the USCS Surveillance Support Branch (SSB) East and West Aircraft Maintenance Inspectors (AMI) on the upgrade process of the CWR RTA-852L units.  Based on the USCS P-3 operational commitments a firm schedule is not available, Rockwell Collins POC shall coordinate with each AMI for the upgrade of the CWR RTA-852L units and delivery schedule.  Delivery of the Color Weather Radar shall be FOB destination.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition, the specific evaluation criteria relating to paragraph (a) are price and technical (ability of offeror to meet the Government?s specification) and technical is more important then price.  A completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications ? Commercial Items shall be part of the quote submission.  The provision at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items applies to this acquisition along with the following FAR clauses cited within this clause; 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37 and 52.232-33.

All capability statements received by December 27, 2002 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time will be considered by the Government; however, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Government Response: Information on NCI Clinical Trials infrastructure, including design artifacts is available via the NCICB's WWW site (http://ncicb.nic.nih.gov).  No other material is currently available. 2.	Question:  (Reference 3.0, Objective) / How does, "?the collection and analysis of clinical trial data", differ from NCI's implementation of the Oracle Clinical Trial Product? Government Response: The solicitation does not directly address the collection of primary patient-based clinical trials data, which is the objective of the Oracle Clinical application. 3.	Question:  (Reference 4.1, Develop a System for Serious Adverse Event Reporting) / 	Can prospective offerors review the KA feasibility study report?  Also, will the Government make available any documents pertaining to CSAERS that prospective offerors can review? Government Response: Documents pertaining to NCI Clinical Trials infrastructure models and design documents are available only through the NCICB's WWW site (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov). 4.	Question:  Is CSAERS an in-house NCI developed product or is CSAERS an implementation of Oracle AERS? Government Response: Current plans call for the development of custom software. 5.	Question:  What is the user base for the SAE, DESK and PIMS systems? Are they all internal NCI / NIH employees or do they include external users? Government Response: The DESK and PIMS systems are designed for internal use.  The SAE system will serve both internal and external users. 6.	Question:  What hardware, operating system and databases (if any) support the PIMS and DESK systems? Government Response: The current technology stack is UNIX based systems, running on SUN platforms.  Where databases are utilized, the platform is ORACLE.  7.	Question:  How many users currently use the systems? Number of active users v/s Number of named users? Government Response: The current number of users is less than 50.  The SAE system may support a greater load.   8.	Question:  What is the Average Network Bandwidth per user? Government Response: Users are assumed to have high-speed internet access. 9.

Question:  Is there a requirement for an interface between SAE and DESK or PIMS? Government Response: SAE and DESK/PIMS systems will need to interface. 11.	Question:  What are the requirements for the hardware platforms for SAE? Government Response: The preferred platform is UNIX/SUN. 12.	Question:  Are there any Reporting requirements from DESK / PIMS systems? Government Response: Ideally the systems should support standard regulatory reporting.  13.	Question:  Are there any security considerations for DESK / PIMS? E.g. firewall, footprints, audit trails, etc Government Response: Yes. 14.	Question:  Are there any custom Workflow / Notification requirements to be developed? Government Response: Yes. 15.	Question:  Section 7.0. Contractor qualification criteria requires in-depth knowledge of NCI Enterprise models and DESK and PIMS. Is there a specific facility that will be used to judge qualifications? Government Response: Knowledge of the NCI Enterprise models will be evaluated based on their described use in response to the solicitation, or indications on why they will not be used. 16.	Question:  Is there an incumbent contractor?  Can you provide information about the number of FTE's currently supporting the systems? Government Response: The incumbent contractor is Oracle Corporation.  For numerous reasons, it is not possible to provide an FTE count for these systems. 17.	Question:  What is the start date for the period of performance? Government Response: At award of contract for a period of six months, with possible options (3 option periods = 6 months each). Question:  Are there any requirements for training curriculum development or training delivery for the SAE system under the terms of this contract?

Question:  The Statement of Work does not include organizational change management tasks or deliverables customarily associated with enterprise systems implementation -- such as organizational impact assessment, workforce transition, communications, training.  Are DCP staff resources rather than contractor staff resources being applied to these activities? Government Response: Change Management tasks are covered by other entities.  However, the contractor is expected to utilize best practices for development and as such should include effort tracking the development process and ongoing efforts to assess user needs.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to BAE, Nashua NH for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items that are determined to be sole source to BAE.  The initial award will focus on items within FSC 5895.  Other sole source items outside of FSC 5895 will be included throughout the life of the contract.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated for a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance may be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.   This synopsis is being issued to conduct market research for informational and planning purposes only.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  The Air Force Mission Support Systems (AFMSS) System Program Office (SPO), Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom Air Force Base, MA 01731, is seeking potential sources capable of supporting system engineering and integration for the US Air Force, US Navy, US Army, and USSOCOM mission planning.   The purpose of this announcement is to help the AFMSS SPO mitigate program cost, as well as schedule and performance risks, by identifying those potential offerors the Government considers to be "highly competitive" as prime contractors for the SEIC effort.  The Government requests interested companies submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the criteria below.  Responses should include examples of similar efforts. Interested sources, either alone or with appropriate teaming partners, should provide expertise/experience in the following areas: 1) Possess or have the ability to obtain an U.S. Secret level facility security clearance. Some personnel may be required to obtain Top Secret (TS) security clearance to support TS programs at other facilities.  2) Integrating large, complex software-intensive systems; 3) Configuration management and change control of evolving software components including multiple concurrent baselines; 4) Developing and maintaining roadmaps for concurrent, spiral development and incremental fielding of all mission planning software components as well as the framework; 5) Developing and maintaining knowledge repositories for use by the Government and development contractors; 6) Testing software-intensive systems at the component level as well as at the integrated system level; 7) Training developers through Software Development Kits, and wizards; 8) Working on Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) with the Government as well as multiple development contractors; 9) Obtaining DoD security, information assurance, Common Operating Environment (COE), Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), and interoperability certifications; 10) Advising the Government on the management of design or interface change proposal activity and software problem reports especially as they relate to individual development activities across large software development programs; 11) Architecture engineering, especially for top level architecture and data modeling performance; 12) Working with the Mission Planning domain. The Government requests interested sources submit a capability package via CD-ROM with two hard copies to the following address: Ms Barbara Lawrence, Contracting Officer, ESC/ACK, 50 Griffiss Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1625.

The Government will determine whether each capability package submitted is considered "highly competitive" or "not highly competitive" for the SEIC effort based solely upon whether each package adequately addresses the key SEIC screening criteria above. The Government will then notify each source that submitted a capability package in writing of the Government's determination and its rationale for the determination. A source's capability package should indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor or subcontractor. Sources interested only in subcontractor opportunities should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise in a two page response.  Names and points of contact from each potential subcontractor will be distributed to all interested sources. Sources should also indicate whether they are a large business, small business, or a small disadvantaged business.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK.  This is a Sources Sought Announcement under which GSA is publicizing our intention to contract for the following services using construction excellence.  THIS IS NOT AN RFP.  If your company would be interested in participating in this project, it is requested that you contact Enrico Caruso, Contracting Officer at 212-264-9490 or e-mail at enrico.caruso@gsa.gov to express your interest. 

GSA intends to contract for complete construction services for a new U.S. Courthouse in Buffalo, NY with general construction contractors that offer the best overall value to the Government, by: demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The proposed U.S. Courthouse will be constructed in the Buffalo Downtown Commercial Business District (CBD), and will consist of approximately 24,721 m2 (266,020gsf) including 2,007 m2 (21,600 gsf) for indoor parking.  The building will be occupied by the U.S. District Courts, U.S. Magistrate Courts, District Clerk of Court, U.S. Probation, Circuit Satellite Library, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Attorney and GSA. The courthouse will provide five district courtrooms, four magistrate courtrooms, related office space, sally port, detention cells, and joint use GSA space, etc.  In addition, fifty-four (54) secured, indoor parking spaces will be provided.  Occupancy is planned for early 2007.  General construction contractors may request to be put on the Bidder's Mailing List by submitting a one page letter to the attention of Enrico Caruso at 212-264-9490, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), Property Development Division, 26 Federal Plaza; New York, NY 10278, within 30 days of receipt.  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $70,000,000 to $77,000,000.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is tentatively scheduled to be issued in late February 2003.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held approximately ten (10) days following the issuance of the RFP. Any questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria will be answered.  A Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session is scheduled to immediately follow the Pre-Proposal Conference. 

This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns. The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  The project is in Metric Units of Measure.  The general construction contractor selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, supervision and constructability reviews during the A-E's Design Phase to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing RFIs, change orders, etc. throughout the course of this project.

The Government anticipates the award of a Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.2), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the general contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered.  The entire procurement process will be performed in three (3) Stages, for a point total of 1000.   [The selection of a general contractor will be made at the end of 50% construction documents].  Stage I Submission:  The Government will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Technical and Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) submissions coincident with the end of the A/E Preliminary Design Concept Phase.  Any scope changes by the Government that may result from the pre-proposal conference may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  

The technical factors for Stage I, will be as follows-point total 400: (1) Offeror?s Experience on Similar Projects (100 Points); (2) Offeror?s Past Performance on Similar Projects (100 Points); (3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel of the Prime Contractor (150 Points), and (4) Management Plan Outline (50 Points).  The submission of price will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data but under separate cover and will be based on documents supplied by the A-E design firm relative to the Preliminary Design concepts.  This price should reflect the contractor's Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for General Contractor Services. Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of no more than three (3) contractors that offer the best value will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306-(c).  The three (3) short listed offerors are expected to be involved from the A/E Final Design Concept Phase through the end of the 50% Construction Documents Phase. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage II and III becomes the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror.

Stage II:  During this stage the three (3) shortlisted contractors will enter into the Participation Phase of the solicitation. The level of effort in this phase includes the following:  Participation in two value engineering workshops lasting two days each, participate in two (2) project meetings, preparation of written comments, performance of one constructability review and preparation of one independent estimate during the Design Development Phase.  Following the completion of this phase, the offerors' efforts will be evaluated as follows - point total 200:  Stage II Technical Evaluation Factors:  (5) Design Development Participation Phase (200 Points maximum) will consist of the following sub-factors:  (a) Value Engineering Workshop (50 pts.); (b) Written Comments/Ideas (50 pts.); (c) Design Development Constructability Review (50 pts.); (d) Estimate Development (50 pts.).  The Offeror will supply a price that should reflect the offeror's Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). At the end of Stage II, the three (3) short listed GC's that participate in good faith will be provided a stipend of $15,000 for their total effort for the services rendered during this stage.   

Stage III:  During this Stage, the three (3) short listed contractors will enter into the final phase of the solicitation coincident with the A/E 50% Construction Document Phase.  Following completion of this phase the offerors' efforts will be evaluated as follows- point total 400:  Stage III Technical Evaluation Factors:  (6) 50% Construction Documentation Phase will consist of the following sub-factors: (a) Construction Document Review, where final recommendations for improvement of the project will be identified in a presentation to GSA, (150 pts), (b) Construction Document Presentation (100 pts); (c) Detailed Project Management Plan and Technical Approach (100 pts); and (d) Subcontractor Qualifications (50 pts maximum) which will include the following sub-factors:  (i) Information on Subcontractors (25 pts) and (ii) Small Business Subcontracting Plan (25 pts).  The offerors in the competitive range will engage in discussions with GSA, this should include a discussion of the offerors' submission of their management plan and subcontractor information.  After the discussion, the Government will request a revised technical proposal and the contractor's Firm-Fixed Price Proposal for General Contractor Services.  Also to be included will be a mandatory, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.705-4 encompassing the following minimum Socio-Economic Program minimum goals:  (The goals will probably be different based on the location of the project). Small Business (23%), Small Disadvantaged Business (5%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%) and HUBZone Businesses (1.5%).  A failure to submit this plan in conjunction with the Stage III final price proposal, when requested, will render the offer unacceptable.  All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the solicitation number.  Offerors are encouraged to submit their proposals on their most favorable terms and following the combination of the evaluation of technical factors 1-6 with the final price proposal submission, an award will be made to the (offeror) general contractor that offers the best value to the Government. 

 After the award of this contract to the one (1) selected general contractor, a second stipend of $15,000 will be provided to each of the three (3) short listed firms that participated in a good faith effort for their services rendered during Stage III.  The selected general contractor (1) will participate in Constructability Services for the 100% and Final Construction Documents Phase and submittal of a Firm Fixed Price Proposal. The Contractor will receive a stipend of $60,000 for services during this Stage.  The GSA will subsequently exercise an option for the construction of the project.


Following the Pre-Proposal Conference that is scheduled during Stage I, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking Session for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Minority, and Woman-Owned Businesses.  The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering bidding on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is an active partner in the E-Grants Presidential Priority Initiative, the Federal-wide effort to develop a uniform, streamlined and more automated grants application and management process. The project is considered a high priority for the Federal government in achieving goals under the Government Paperwork Reduction Act and the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, in addition to E-Government goals. Our contributions and progress on this project have direct implications for the Department of Labor's Presidential Management Initiative scorecard evaluation. 
For the E-Grants initiative, the DOL is responsible for implementing a Department-wide solution that can work with grant applications submitted via the E-Grants web-portal and manage the evaluation, administration, award, and close-out of grants. DOL is currently in the process of reviewing vendors in the marketplace and requesting information from them so that we can determine if their products will meet the needs of the Department. 
Interested Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product vendors should contact Julie Lawrence via email: lawrence-julie@dol.gov to receive the list of desired features with detailed response instructions. Requests for response instructions must be made no later than December 30, 2002. The subject of the e-mail should state: E-Grants Request for Information. 
Vendors are required to submit their responses to the desired feature set as well as an explanation of their product's features and capabilities on a compact disk (CD) no later than close-of- business on January 9, 2003. Completed responses should be sent on CD with accompanying materials to:

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of HIV candidate vaccines that elicit broadly cross-reactive HIV neutralizing antibodies
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute seeks partners to participate in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop the following technology.  This technology encompasses tethered HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) constructs where gp120 and the ectodomain of gp41 are joined by flexible linkers.  Tethered Envs with long linkers (longer than 15 aa but shorter than 30 aa) were stable and recognized by conformationally dependent anti-gp120 and anti-gp41 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).  Surprisingly, these proteins potently inhibited membrane fusion mediated by R5, X4 and R5X4 Envs. Compared to uncleaved soluble Env tethered Envs which exhibited increased binding to anti-gp41 cluster II mAbs but not to cluster I mAbs.  Cluster II mAbs but not cluster I, IV or V mAbs reversed their inhibitory effect, suggesting the mechanism of inhibition might be due to exposed conserved gp41 structures.  These findings suggest the existence of conserved gp41 structures that are important for HIV-1 entry and can be stably exposed in the native environment of the Env even in the absence of receptor-mediated activation.  Thus tethered Envs with long linkers may be important for the development of novel vaccine immunogens.  Preliminary experiments with DNA immunization of mice suggest that tethered Envs elicit antibodies that neutralize heterologous isolates about 10-fold better than sera from mice immunized with gp120.  NCI is seeking collaborators to further develop and characterize the tethered Envs as candidate vaccines and eventually perform clinical trials.  The NCI has a variety of assays for in vitro evaluation of the sera, and can engineer different modifications of the tethered Envs for enhancement of the their immunogenicity.

<SUBJECT>A -- Revolutionary Air-Armament Technologies: A Seminar Series
<DESC>The United States Air Force war-fighting dominance depends upon our superior people, training, platforms, information, and air armaments.  To maintain the edge in air armaments, the Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory directs and conducts fundamental and applied research on conventional air-delivered armaments.  Research activities incorporate every aspect of conventional weapon design including seekers, navigation and control, image and signal processing, explosives, warheads, fuzing, and munitions integration and assessment. Our research vision is not constrained to just traditional incremental developments; rather, we openly seek investments in justifiable high-leverage or paradigm-shifting technologies involving innovative concepts of operation and information-centric warfare applicable to strategic military engagements beyond 2020.  
Our concerted search for such Revolutionary Technologies led to the commission of the Revolutionary Technology Committee in 1998; under its charter and headed by the Chief Scientist Dr. Robert L. Sierakowski, the Munitions Directorate funds revolutionary technology projects, establishes long-term challenges, and sponsors distinguished lecturers.  This seminar series has been used to illuminate the grand challenges and stimulate creativity in a diverse acquisition community at Eglin AFB.
Among the distinguished speakers that have participated in the seminar series are: Professor Lawrence Krauss, the author of The Physics of Star Trek; astrophysicist Jeanne Cavelos, the author of The Science of Star Wars; Dr. Dennis Bushnell, the Chief Scientist of NASA, Langley; and a senior intelligence analyst.  
Some lectures contain sensitive information but others are open to the public with space-available seating.  Lectures usually last one hour with another hour allocated for questions, discussion, and book signings when applicable.    
The Directorate typically sponsors two guest visits annually and provides for the invitees? travel expenses and a nominal stipend for professional services.  Candidate speakers include renown authors, distinguished professors, private consultants, and senior intelligence officers; speakers are expected to have visionary expertise evidenced by publications and prior lectures at similar venues.  The Revolutionary Technology Committee accepts nominations for consideration on a continual basis.  For further information, please contact Dr. Alex Cash: cash@eglin.af.mil, 850-882-2141, ext. 2210.
