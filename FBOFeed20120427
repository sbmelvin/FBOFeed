<DESC>This is a synopsis of proposed contract action FA4452-12-R-0012. This is not a solicitation or invitation for offerors to submit proposals. Please note that all dates listed in this synopsis are tentative and are subject to change.<br />Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) Specialized Contracting Branch (A7KQ) intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN) support services. The government intends to issue the RFP on or around 14 May 12. This acquisition will be set-aside for small business (small business must accomplish at least 51% of the services performed) utilizing North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code of 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, with a size standard of $25.0M. <br />This is a competitive best value source selection using tradeoff process IAW FAR 15.101-1 and DFARS 215.3. The government will utilize performance/price tradeoff technique IAW AFFARS 5315.3 documented at MP 5315 AFFARS Library/Section M Templates/Approach #3 - Evaluate Technical, Rank by Price, Assess Performance until Proposal rated Substantial Confidence or all offers are evaluated. This technique is a simplified method that permits a tradeoff between price and performance in reaching the contract award decision. The government will award a contract resulting from the RFP to the contractor whose offer conforms to the RFP requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and provides the best value to the government. If the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price does not receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment rating, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated for a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment. The evaluation process will continue until an offer that is technically acceptable receives a performance confidence assessment rating of "Substantial Confidence" or all offers are evaluated. At this point, the evaluation is complete and the SSA proceeds to the integrated best value assessment of the evaluated offerors.<br /><br />The planned period of performance is as follows:<br />Base Period:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Oct 12 - 30 Sep 13<br />Option Period 1: 1 Oct 13 - 30 Sep 14<br />Option Period 2: 1 Oct 14 - 30 Sep 15<br />Option Period 3: 1 Oct 15 - 30 Sep 16<br />

<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs/Office of Facilities Management & Construction anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price Design-Build contract based upon a two-phase selection procedure.  The project solicitation consists of Two (2) Phases.  The Pre-Solicitation Notice represents Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of the Two-Phase, Design-Build process.  To be further evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time.
The project is located on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation at Eagle Butte (Dewey County), South Dakota (Eagle Butte, South Dakota is approximately 90 miles north of Pierre, South Dakota).
The North American Industry System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220, and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $33.5 Million dollars.  This project is available to all responsible Design-Build Contractors nationwide meeting the above-referenced NAICS code and size standard under full and open competition.
The Scope of Work includes the Design and Construction of the Eagle Butte Campus Renovations Project.  This project includes Fire Protection, and Multiple Buildings Mechanical and Architectural Renovations.
Also included in this project is the Construction of previously designed projects to include Asbestos Abatement & Microbial Remediation, Emergency Generators, Boiler Room and Heating System Restoration and Renovation, and Building Heating System Repairs.
The contractor's design will be based upon the Schematic Design (SD) drawings, project requirements narrative, and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request of Proposal (Phase Two).  Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions will be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.  
The estimated price is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, including Abatement/Remediation and all design and construction services.  The contract provides for preparation of Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CDs).  
Record (redline) hard copy drawings and As-Constructed AutoCAD files drawings will also be required upon construction completion. 
All Design-Build (D-B) firms have until 4:00 P.M. (Central Standard Time Zone), May 29, 2012, to provide qualifications for evaluation based upon the following criteria in descending order in importance:
1.  Past performance, demonstrating quality of work, professional expertise, technical competence, and ability to effectively schedule and manage a multi-disciplinary work force; 
2.  Extent of design/build experience, especially experience that the offeror's current A-E/construction company partnership has working together;  
3.  Demonstrated ability to provide innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost; 
4.  Experience with projects of a type and scope similar to that of this project, which include implementation of BIA requirements and successful implementation of a Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) Compliance Plan. 
Design-Build (D-B) firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit a Standard Form (SF) 330, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated above for Phase One evaluation.  The SF 330's are formatted for Architect-Engineer (A-E) and related services, but this form will be used for both design and construction qualifications.

Only hard copy responses received by 4:00 P.M. (Central Standard Time Zone), May 29, 2012, will be evaluated further.  
Up to Five (5) of the most highly-qualified Design-Build (D-B) firms will be short-listed to participate in Phase Two of this Design-Build (D-B) selection process. 
In Phase Two, the firms short-listed will be sent the Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the Schematic Design Drawings, Project Requirements Narrative, Performance Technical Specifications (PTS), and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals.  Offerors will be asked to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan, describing the contractor's management philosophy schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposal.  The RFP will not require new design drawings as part of the Phase Two submittal.  A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals and a sub-contracting plan - large business contractors will be expected to subcontract at least 25% of the award total to small businesses.  
Short-listed offerors will be asked to submit both a technical and price proposal based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP.  Award of a single contract will be made to the "Best Value" offeror.  Debriefings will be made available after contract award.

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source for additional scope of work to CreareInc. in order to facilitate a system-level comparative study of a variety of LH2temperature cryocooler systems on one common platform one such concept - Co-Storage.Co-storage of cryogenic propellants consists of the higher temperature cryogenicpropellant providing a temperature stage that acts as a thermal shield for the lowertemperature cryogenic propellant. Co-storage of cryogenic propellants, can reduces theheat load on lower temperature hydrogen (20 K) tank from hundreds of watts to few wattsby intercepting a large fraction of the heat at the higher temperature oxygen tank (100K).  Since the future tank size is undetermined, a scaling study is necessary, in whichthe load of the cryocooling system varies from 10 to 40 Watts at 20K with or withoutupper stage cooler at 90K removing 100 to 200 Watts.  Creare is a leading developer of Reverse Brayton Cycle Cryocoolers for spaceapplications.  The company also has several other experiences in developing space flightcryocoolers. NASA/GSFC has placed great emphasis on accountability and improvingperformance to mission success.  The performance of the additional scope by Creare, Inc.,is considered to be in the best interest of the government, which would avoid theduplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered throughcompetition.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Center for Nanoscience and Technology (CNST), intends to negotiate with Coventor, Inc.; Cary, NC, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to purchase/renew software on existing CoventorWare software licenses for 1 year.
<p>NIST has been using CoventorWare Analyzer for several years and has generated a significant amount of modeling data with it. This software is used for finite element numerical analysis of complex MEMS and NEMS devices in 3 dimensions. Market research has shown that no other software package is compatible with this data. By not renewing the license and purchasing different software, NIST would lose access to results obtained over the last several years. Additionally, NIST collaborates with a group at Argonne National Labs, which also uses this software. NIST would not be able to share models and results with them if it used a different software package that is not compatible with CoventorWare.</p>
<p>NIST intends to procure annual maintenance for CoventorWare Analyzer, to include all upgrades, technical support, and electronic documentation. Recent market research conducted by NIST shows that Coventor, Inc. is the only authorized provider of this software in the United States. Coventor, Inc. has the sole proprietary and patent rights to this software.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Coventor, Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Eric Bubar at eric.bubar@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than May 7, 2012 at 5:00 pm.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to procure a 5-shelf stand-alone zebrafish rack system with life-support equipment (tanks, filters, etc.) from Aquatic Habitats. The Institute intends to purchase this equipment by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302. The lab in NIAAA currently has one Aquatic Habitats rack system and requires a second system. The existing system has been used for previous published studies.

Description:  This project will replace the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system at the Park Visitor Center, located in the historic Fordyce Bathhouse at the center of Bathhouse Row. Visitation exceeds 300,000 per year.  The building, constructed in 1914, exceeds 28,000 square feet of conditioned space on four floors (including basement), and also houses a large portion of the Park's museum collection.  The current HVAC system was installed in the 1980's and was designed with 70 tons of cooling capacity.  The preparation of Construction Documents is currently underway.  Major components of the project include:  Replacing the large chiller, condensing unit, three compressors, two gas fired boilers, and the large and small air handlers on each floor, Re-establishment of the heat exchanger system for thermal water heat, Replacing the liquid handling and pumping system as well as zone controllers, thermostats, variable air volume (VAV) boxes throughout the building and re-heat coils throughout the building, Replacement/rehabilitation and upsizing the duct system to improve air distribution, A system that is fully DDC controlled and connected through the Park network into the existing HVAC  SCADA system, A four pipe heating and chilled water hydronic system to serve the air handlers and VAV boxes for heating and cooling, Air cooled chillers, gas fired boilers, and shell and tube heat exchangers to create the heating and chilled water, A system with 100 tons of cooling capacity, The system will take advantage of underground thermal water to reduce some of the heating costs, A temperature control system with a computer-based automation system connected to the existing park wide energy management system, Moving some of the mechanical and electrical equipment located in the basement to higher elevations to minimize damage from flooding,  Modification/conversion of several spaces to be used as mechanical spaces,  Installation of a larger transformer and electrical circuit breaker and distribution panels.  Contractor to have similar experience working on historical structures.  
Because of the historic nature of the building, (National Historic Landmark Building), the project is limited in the kind of energy saving improvements allowed without affecting the historic character of the building. To access duct chases, some existing building fabric will be removed and replaced. The project will include additional attic insulation and replacement of skylights.
The NAICS code for this requirement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the size standard is $33.5 million.
Type of Procurement:  A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal.  
Estimated Price Range:  $1,500,000 to $1,900,000
Estimated Time for Completion:  approximately 240 calendar days following the notice to proceed      
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net (http://web.sba.gov/subnet), and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search  (http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs)  for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.

<DESC><p>The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Hanley Wood Market Intelligence, One Thomas Circle N.W., Suite 600, Washington, D.C. These data will provide HUD's field economists with much needed single-family market data, particularly relating to new home sales. In addition to providing data on prices and the number of units sold, Hanley Wood also provides data on the number of new units being absorbed, units under construction, and units in planning. The data are updated monthly. HUD must have ready access to data regarding single-family housing market conditions such as average prices, recent absorptions trends, new home sales price distributions, and planned new developments. Access to the Hanley Wood Market Intelligence Research Pro online tool, Housing Intelligence Pro, will provide these types of data for those market areas covered by them, especially single-family market data, particularly relating to new home sales.</p>

<DESC><p>Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR)</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY AND NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) DOCUMENT. THE RFP/SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE OF THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME. THIS NOTICE IS TO MAKE POTENTIAL OFFERORS AWARE THAT THEY SHOULD PLAN FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to award a single contract for the EDGAR system. The base period will be for three (3) years and there will be five (5) option periods of one (1) year each.</p>
<p>EDGAR is a system developed to automate the filing, processing and dissemination of some 125 million pages of registration statements, reports and other filings received by the SEC each year. These submissions currently are received from over 28,000 registered entities and hundreds of thousands of individual filers.</p>
<p>EDGAR was designed as a stand-alone system to include all hardware, applications, and systems software. Contractor support services are currently being used for development of new functionality, systems operation and monitoring, and for hardware and software maintenance.</p>
<p>The major processes of the electronic filing life cycle supported by EDGAR are the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Preparation and submission by filers;<br />&bull; Receipt and acceptance by SEC;<br />&bull; Data storage and retrieval;<br />&bull; Data dissemination to the public; and<br />&bull; Analysis and review by SEC staff.</p>
<p>This acquisition shall include modernization of the entire EDGAR system to include business process transformations for simplifying the current interfaces and functionality, providing support tools for SEC staff, and continuing to utilize web-based, user friendly technology to make filing easier, dissemination faster and cheaper, and further secure the entire process. Additional pertinent information:</p>
<p>&bull; This solicitation shall be awarded for a three (3) year period of performance with five (5) option periods of one (1) year (for a total of eight (8) years);<br />&bull; Dissemination subscription fees for all three (3) contract years and all option years will be specified at the time of contract award and be subject to future modifications;<br />&bull; Revenues derived from sale of dissemination services shall be used to pay for the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the Dissemination Subsystem; and<br />&bull; During the first 120 days of this contract, the SEC will curtail development efforts of new functionality to allow proper transition, however, it is expected that any development activity in the pipeline will also be transitioned during this period so that development may resume during the transition period. This does not apply to priority one bug fixes during the transition period.</p>
<p>Draft RFP Sections C &amp; F and attachments F1, F3, &amp; F7 are attached for review.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes only.  The US Army Contracting Command - Rock Island is planning an acquisition for the requirements of the Program Management Support Services-Three (PMSS-3) staff augmentation program. PMSS-3 is a follow-on to the current PMSS-2 Contract which expires 20 June 2014. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Army's support services requirements. The PMSS-3 program is managed by the Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Operations  Directorate (OD), Contracts Compliance and Management Division (CACD), Ft Belvoir, VA 22060. The purpose of PMSS-3 is to provide the full range of information technology-related program management support services, to include advisory and acquisition consulting services, required by PEO EIS headquarters, directorates, program/project/product offices, and PEO EIS related organizations in support of various missions and of command, control, and communications activities.  The PMSS-3 acquisition will provide the requiring offices with the means to acquire and select from new sources of assets and capabilities to support their program management support services requirements.  For more information about the PEO EIS organization, see the following website: www.eis.army.mil <br> <br>Statement of Need.  Successful PMSS-3 contractors shall ensure that a broad range of expertise is available in many disciplines and specifically in the functional areas of Program/Project/Product Management; Business Process Reengineering (BPR); Information Systems Security; Contingency Planning; Physical Security; Enterprise Design, Integration, and Consolidation; Systems Operation and Maintenance; Integrated Logistics Support; Acquisition Management Support and other Information Technology-related Services for the life cycle activities that are required by the organizations.  <br><br>Capability Statement. An interested source may provide a corporate capability statement. The statement shall explain why the source believes that it has the technical capability to meet the Government's requirements to include experience of personnel, organizational history on meeting this or similar requirements, corporate acumen in managing multiple government contracts of the same or similar nature, ability to expand its workforce to perform multiple, concurrent, high-value task orders, e.g. through teaming, hiring, internal reassignment, etc.  The statement should also include an example in which it has succeeded in rapidly expanding its personnel capacity.  The statement shall include the source's website address; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only) and POC for this client; business size and applicable NAICS codes; socio-economic status; number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three Government fiscal years. This statement shall not exceed 7 pages. The page limit does not apply to advertising material such as company brochures and catalogs. <br><br>Acquisition Strategy.  The Government intends to award five, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Three of the contracts will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition, and two awards will be reserved for small business.  However, the Government reserves the right to award less than five contracts.  Issuance of Task Orders will be limited to PEO EIS components.  The geographic scope of the contract will include CONUS and OCONUS, and onsite work may be required in hazardous locations, such as Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. The contracts and task orders will be performance-based. Task orders will be competed on a fair opportunity basis among all PMSS-3 contractors. The contract life will be 3 years.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611. The applicable PSC is R408. <br><br>Pricing Strategy. The Government intends to utilize multiple contract types for PMSS-3 contracts e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time & Material and Labor Hour Task Orders. <br><br>Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs). Interested sources are advised that the provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5 concerning OCIs will govern Task Orders issued under the PMSS-3 contract and that potential OCIs with current and future procurements and programs may exist, in accordance with FAR 9.505-1 through 9.505-4, because of the tasks in the PWS, such as requirements management, specification development, program oversight, independent testing, etc. Consequently, the PMSS-3 contractors will be excluded from participating in these procurements and programs. It is anticipated that at a minimum all current ITES2S prime contractors may be excluded from participating in the PMSS-3 competition. <br><br>Due Diligence. A draft solicitation, pre-solicitation conference, and pre-proposal conference are not planned.  A best value evaluation will be performed IAW FAR Part 15. The Government will select the proposals that are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. The evaluation factors under consideration include, but not limited to, corporate capabilities, price, past performance, technical/management and small business participation. <br><br>Schedule. The Government plans on releasing the PMSS-3 solicitation in the third quarter of CY 2011.  At the appropriate time an additional solicitation synopsis will be issued and the solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site.  <br><br>Response Format.  Responses shall be single-spaced, 12-point font, and not less than 1 inch margins. Based on the page limits set forth above, the total length of the response shall not exceed 7 pages, excluding company brochures and catalogs. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), a response to this synopsis is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Response to this synopsis is voluntary. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor pay for information provided in response to this synopsis. This information will not be returned. Corporate information marked Proprietary, such as non-public pricing or bid strategy, will be safeguarded, but the Government may use comments or suggestions about the PMSS-3 acquisition in any way that the Government chooses.

<DESC>This is an industry-wide Request for Information Notice for planning purposes only. This is not a competitive solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded from this notice. The Department of State is requesting industry expertise to assist in developing a potential requirement for the future. All information requested is voluntary, no reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this Notice.
<p>We thank you for your participation and ask that all questions regarding this announcement be submitted electronically via email so we can keep track of the information exchanges. Please see the following information below and respond accordingly:</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Department of State is looking to refresh their Network-based Advanced Threat Detection (ATD) / Deep Packet Inspection &amp; Analytics (DPIA) technologies that support their Defense in Depth architecture. The technology will be adjacent to current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and other border protection technologies. We are looking to combat the problem of the zero-day polymorphic malware that is often used to deliver the targeted attack payload. Advanced malware often uses file multi-packing, layered encoding, dynamic malware creation and other more advanced techniques to bypass many of today's existing signature-based security controls and deliver their malicious payloads onto the targeted individuals' computing systems. We are looking to get the best of breed of these products which should also includes features such as behavioral detection, heuristics, anomaly detection, virtual execution environments and other policy rules around content to enable the rapid evaluation and playback of potentially malicious content. The tool must also be scalable to monitor both inside and outside of our border protection schemes at two internet points of presence at line speed. With that said, this RFI is seeking comments on the requirements and measurements to ensure that we get the best of breed in the Advanced Threat Detection / Deep Packet Inspection &amp; Analytics Market.</p>
<p>Infrastructure</p>
<p>Department of State infrastructure consists of 2 points of presence and includes an arsenal of security tools that support a security in depth architecture. The network architecture and tools pull data from a global environment that consist of IDS/IPS tools, firewalls, insider threat protection tools, host based security tools, enterprise SAN, and a SIEM. Network backbone consists of various line speeds which produces an average of 700 MB/ sec captured data packets into our repository. This average is expected to grow 30% - 40% compounded per year. Interface, storage and retention requirements will grow to adhere to mandates.</p>
<p>User Adoption</p>
<p>Department of State's security posture is based on project success and milestones of which analysts spear head the programs worth. A Successful program relies on carefully calculated attainable metrics. To facilitate user adoption, it is important to find out what the legacy process is. Most IT projects involve designing systems which replace or augment some legacy process. Hence, it is important to show that not only is the new system being used, but that the old process is phased out. In general, if the legacy process that the system solution was designed to replace is still in use after not meeting certain milestones or metric's, then the project is a failure. It is important to show value by properly planning and measuring agreed upon metrics. How would you propose a set of requirements to address a successful user adoption model?</p>
<p>Submission Details</p>
<p>The Department of State is looking for potential RFI responders to outline their approach to how to write the requirements, what we could look for in a response, and what is commercially available to address, and expand on the functional areas below.</p>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

PURPOSE:

Request for Information:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center (VA DALC), in support of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office, Purchased Care Office, is contemplating the issuance of a solicitation for non-VA provided dialysis services. (Please see the list below.) 
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to provide interested parties the opportunity to inform the VA of their capabilities to perform the services addressed in this RFI and to complete and submit the questionnaire beginning on page two.  The information provided in response to the RFI will assist the VA in understanding standard industry practices and facilitate the VA development of the requirement.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS/PROPOSALS.
BACKGROUND:
The VHA Chief Business Office identified a need for community providers to provide, deliver, supervise, and monitor Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis services for eligible beneficiaries through contract arrangements in 2009.  

This need lead to the creation of a contract vehicle capable of providing support to multiple Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISNs).  Due to the success of this program, additional VISNs began inquiring about utilizing this contract vehicle for their own dialysis needs.  This has lead to the issuing of basic ordering agreements (BOAs), which have been put in place to provide coverage for additional regions.  It is our intent this future procurement will put into place single contracts with multiple awards to eliminate the variety of contracts and BOA's across the country.  At the time the contract vehicle and the BOAs were initiated, VA created its own bundle of services to be included in each treatment modality.  Since the inception of VA's contract instruments Medicare has created its own bundle and new payment methodology.  The goal of this new procurement is to match and maintain services, bundling and pricing as defined by and equivalent to  Medicare so that there is consistency in contractor requirements and industry practices. 

Intended services include chronic hemodialysis (outpatient), home hemodialysis, chronic peritoneal (outpatient) dialysis, center-based nocturnal dialysis, short daily dialysis, and training sessions for home-based hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.  Dialysis services to VA beneficiaries as referred by the VA Medical Centers (VAMC).  Services to be provided under the contracts would be provided at the contractor's facility(ies), utilizing contractor owned and maintained equipment.  The Contractor would also provide the necessary equipment for completing home dialysis treatments, when appropriate, as indentified by the referring VAMC.  The contractor's facility(ies) would need to be located within the geographical locations of the referring medical facilities, and be readily accessible to the patient population within the VISNs.  The health care provided will be delivered in a manner consistent with the needs of the patients and standards of quality delivered to the contractor's non-VA patients.  The contractor would need to adhere to all federal and state laws and regulations in effect during the term of the contracts.

All responses shall be sent to Brandon Maness at brandon.maness@va.gov and must be received no later than 12 noon MT on: May 11, 2012.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, AND DOES NOT BIND THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD ANY CONTRACT.  NO SOLICITATIONS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

Please provide the following information: 

1. A brief narrative describing the capabilities of your organization to provide the following services within one or more VISNs as described in the RFI.  Please include the geographic locations in which you will be able to provide these services:

2. As stated in the RFI VA intends to align its pricing and payment methodology with Medicare Prospective Payment of Dialysis to the greatest extent possible.

Do you have any recommendations for aligning the contract line items in such a way as to mimic Medicare's adjustments for outliers and quality incentives? 

3.  VA intends to require all claims be submitted by electronic data interchange (EDI), paper claims would not be accepted. Does this pose any problems for your organization?

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-392-5283	<br />Name:		Binder, Loose-Leaf, Slant D, 3 Ring, No Overlay, Black, 5"<br />Description:	Binder, Loose-Leaf, Slant 3 D-Ring, No Overlay, Black, 5" Capacity. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-392-5283	<br />Similar Items:	AVE07901; WLJ38450B; AVE08901; SAM17600; SPR08901; CRD18062; <br /> CRD18762</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 11, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>MINORITY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION<br />&amp; MINORITY-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS
<p>Government Contracting Workshop<br /><br /><strong>ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP<br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) provides information for organizations interested in doing business with the Federal Government. A series of government contracting (govcon) workshops are being held in a variety of locations throughout the United States to provide information to Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) staff and Minority Owned Small Business (MOSB) representatives to 1) become familiar with processes and procedures associated with federal government contracting; and 2) to identify and pursue contract opportunities with HHS. The objective of these workshops is to engage, equip and inform the MIHE and MOSB participants of the federal procurement process so that they become more effective in pursuing contracting opportunities at HHS.</p>
<p><strong>COST</strong>: FREE</p>
<p><strong>WORKSHOP DATE &amp; LOCATION<br /></strong>May 15-16, 2012 Bellingham Public Library, Fairhaven Branch Auditorium</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/REGISTRATION<br /></strong>For more information and to register, visit http://fedgovconworkshops.com/bellingham-wa-workshop/. For businesses, there is a limit of 2 representatives per company per workshop. Please note that the total registration is limited to 120 people. If you register and cannot attend, please cancel your registration as soon as possible so someone on the waitlist can participate.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding the event, please contact us at fedgovconworkshops@d2dinc.com. <br /><br /><strong>AGENDA<br /></strong>The synopsis of the agenda is below. The full agenda is available on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Day One<br /></strong>&bull;Introduction to Government Contracting<br />&bull;Understanding Procurement Methods<br />&bull;The Government's Internal Process<br />&bull;Small Business Classifications &amp; Certification Programs<br />&bull;Guest Speaker<br />&bull;Other Business Opportunities<br />&bull;Marketing to the Government &amp; HHS<br /><br /><strong>Day Two<br /></strong>&bull;Introduction to FAR and Compliance Issues<br />&bull;Contract Pricing &amp; Cost Proposals<br />&bull;Guest Speaker<br />&bull;Technical Proposals</p>
<p><strong>WHO SHOULD ATTEND?<br /></strong>MOSBs and MIHEs that are interested in pursuing government contracts or who have initiated the process, but have not yet been successful should attend a workshop. This includes business owners, MIHE faculty and staff.</p>
<p>I work for a MIHE. Why Should I Attend?<br />In this economy, Institutions need additional sources of funding. The Federal Government is an excellent resource to fund and get grants for research projects. MIHE faculty and staff should attend a workshop so they understand the government contracting environment and have the tools necessary to navigate the government processes.</p>
<p>This is a Two-Day Event. I'm a Teacher and Can't Afford to Miss Classes.<br />We understand that class schedules may overlap with the workshop schedule. There is no requirement to attend the entire workshop. Come to the session(s) that are convenient for your schedule.</p>
<p>I already know the basics of government contracting. How will this workshop help me?<br />You may be familiar with the basics; however this workshop will delve deeper. You will also gain insight about the proposal development process, which will position you to submit compliant proposals.</p>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Praemittias Systems LLC, 8354 Terminal Road, Suite E, Lorton Virginia, for the manufacturing and delivery of 100 Wolfhound electronic warfare systems to be utilized for pre-deployment training.  This sole source contract is in response to the Urgent Universal Need Statement (UUNS) # 11143UA.

The contract will be firm fixed priced (FFP) for approximately $12.2 M with the first delivery of Wolfhound units 30 days after contract execution.  The delivered units must be identical in form, fit and function as those already fielded in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) so as to provide a high level of training fidelity.

Due to the rapid fielding of the system into the theater of operation, no provision for pre-deployment training was accounted for.
  At this time, there exists an urgent need to field Wolfhound electronic warfare systems in support of Block I through Block IV training and Enhance Mojave Viper training, with deliveries in place to support a 25 May 2012 training evolution.

If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to be technically acceptable or until all offerors are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

<p><br />52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (February 2012), by reference</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.212-1 - Proposal Instructions</p>
<p>Organization and Content of Proposal</p>
<p>Offerors are to follow the proposal format and content suggestions detailed in this section. Each offer should consist of three separately packaged &not;documents: a technical proposal, a cost proposal, and a past performance report. All information necessary to judge the technical soundness of the offer should be contained in the technical proposal. The cost proposal contains all information related to the determination of the costs associated with performing the tasks outlined in the offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>Proposals may include plans to subcontract parts of the work, provided that evidence is presented that any proposed subcontractor has agreed to perform and is fully capable of performing the assigned tasks, and that the offeror has effective control of the subcontractor's work in the project. Offerors are encouraged to make use of subcontractors, those that qualify as small or minority-owned businesses, for specialized tasks where subcontractor expertise would strengthen the offeror's pro&not;posal.</p>
<p>1. Technical proposal <br />Offerors should provide a technical proposal for the entire project. The technical proposal should not exceed 40 pages (1.5 spacing) excluding figures, tables, resumes, and project descriptions.</p>
<p>The technical proposal should be organized into the follow&not;ing sections: Table of Contents, Introduction, General Ap&not;proach, Statement of Work, Project Management, Proposed Staff Related Experience, and Related Corporate Experience. The authors of each section should be clearly identified in the proposal. Specific requirements for each section are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>a. The Table of Contents should provide an easy means to identify major sections of the proposal and major points of discussion.</p>
<p>b. The Introduction should demonstrate the offeror's understanding of the purposes, methodology, and products of the project and should include a very short summary of the offeror's qualifications and unique strengths related to the work outlined in the statement of work. In describing the purposes of the project, offerors should discuss their current understanding of the design of the study and how data from this study can be used to answer international comparative educational questions or to inform policy in this area.</p>
<p>c. The General Approach section should be organized into three parts. In the first part, the offeror is asked to describe its overall approach for successfully accomplishing the work and the rationale for the proposed approach. In the second part, the offeror should identify what it sees as the major challenges associated with conducting TALIS. In the third section, the offeror should describe and justify the methods and approaches it will use to respond to each of these challenges.</p>
<p>d. The Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) section corresponds to the Scope of Work section of ED's PWS, provided with these documents. The offeror's proposal expands upon each of the tasks outlined in the Scope of Work and discusses procedural issues related to completing each task. The offeror's plan for carrying out each task, including the naming of staff members who will play a major role in completing the task, should be clearly stated. Any variations to the tasks and subtasks defined are to be accompanied by a rationale. If the variation affects the overall cost of the study, this should be indicated in the technical proposal and the cost of alter-native designs presented separately in the busi&not;ness or cost proposal. Offerors are encouraged to pro&not;pose alternatives that, if adopted, would improve the study or reduce the costs. However, for evaluation purposes, the offeror must submit a proposal to perform the work as specified in this document. Alternative proposals may also be submitted.</p>
<p>All tasks in the statement of work should be addressed when preparing the offeror's description of the work and methods it will use.</p>
<p>e. Project Management<br />The complexity of the project requires an effective management system that enables tasks to be completed on schedule and within budget. The Project Management section includes discussions of the offeror's procedures for: coordinating and controlling project personnel, resources, and tasks; ensuring adherence to schedules and dead&not;lines; ensuring the security and confidentiality of data; ensuring high quality products and outcomes; identifying potential problems early; maintaining close communication with the COR; and controlling project expenditures. This section outlines the offeror's specific plans for managing the study and identifies how its proposed approach to project management will respond to the special needs and complexities of the project. Specifically, it should also address how the offeror will respond to the activities described in task 13 of the statement of work (study management). Descriptions that are limited to the offeror's general approach to project management will be considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>The Project Management section details the offeror's plan for managing the study including proposed lines of authority, coordination and communica&not;tion within the offeror's organization and with any subcontractors, consultants, and NCES/ED. All person&not;nel, including subcontractor staff and consultants should be identified and their position in the study's management structure detailed in an organization chart. There should also be a staff skills matrix that identifies the project director and key project staff by skill area. All key staff of subcontractors should be identified and described in the same way and listed in the staff skills matrix. There should be sufficient detail on how each project staff member will be used.</p>
<p>In all cases where key personnel external to the offeror's organization are proposed, letters of agree&not;ment (with proposed staff) and letters of availability (endorsed by the primary organizations with which they are affiliated) are to be in&not;cluded. For purposes of the Work Statement, staff includes all personnel proposed to work on the study regardless of their primary affiliation or specific assignment. A person loading chart that shows the number of hours each key staff member will devote to each of the project tasks and the number of total hours each will devote to the core and optional tasks should be included in this section of the offeror's technical proposal. The hours for other project staff (e.g., programmers, clerical staff, field staff) should be reported by labor category. All key staff of subcontractors proposed should be included in the person-loading chart.</p>
<p>The offeror should also provide information on the level of commitment to the project and to other projects and administrative activities for each proposed key staff member (indicated as a percentage of full-time equivalent or FTE). For proposed key staff members who are already committed to other projects and whose time commitment on the other projects would appear to preclude their involvement with TALIS, the offeror should provide a justification for their inclusion among key personnel and how time and commitment conflicts will be resolved, should they arise. The offeror should clearly state how many hours equals one full-time equivalent.</p>
<p>f. Proposed staff related experiences<br />This section of the offeror's proposal should contain a summary for each proposed key staff member that indicates how his/her prior work experience and educational background relates to his/her proposed role on the study. Primary areas of expertise should be clearly specified. The summary should be limited to the two or three experiences that best qualify the staff member for the role he/she will play on the study.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to submit current vitae for each key staff member proposed for the project. The vitae should document only directly related experience, educational background, publications, and professional activities. Each vitae should list: 1) each degree earned (along with the date when each was confirmed, the confirming institution, and the major field of study); 2) no more than four prior/current work or project experiences; and 3) no more than 10 publications and professional presentations. Vitae should only list previous work experience and publications that are relevant to the staff member's proposed duties on the study. Submitting general vitae or vitae that do not clearly identify the information identified above is unacceptable.</p>
<p>One of the single greatest determinants of project success is the quality of the contractor's staff. To plan, conduct and complete the study successfully requires staff that together has technical exper&not;tise, knowledge, and experience in a wide range of areas. At a minimum, staff should have expertise in the following areas: 1) international comparative studies; 2) field operations and troubleshooting, 3) data processing and computer applications; 4) research methodology, statistics, sampling, and psychometrics; 5) data analysis and reporting; and 6) teacher labor workforce research/issues.</p>
<p>Offeror's staff experience and expertise in each of these areas should be clearly described and documented in this section. The offeror's proposal should include a matrix that clearly identifies which of its proposed project staff possesses each of the above skills and expertise.</p>
<p>The Proposed Project Director is critical to the study because this person sets the study's tone and direction. This person should have a mixture of subject area, methodological, and management experience. First, the project director should be knowledgeable in large-scale data collection. Second, the project director should have expertise in survey design and analysis. Third, the project director should be a strong leader who is able to organize, oversee, manage, and control the quality of staff performance on many tasks simultaneously. The project director is ex&not;pected to be a problem solver and a good communicator. The project director should be capable of identifying problems early or anticipating them before they occur. Once identi&not;fied, the project director should not hesitate to share potential problems with the COR for consideration and reso&not;lution. Finally, the project director should be a person who can feel com-fortable working closely with the COR as a colleague and member of the study team. In summary, the project director should have these traits and a demonstrated ability to meet deadlines, to produce qualitative&not;ly sound products within budget, and to keep the COR informed of and involved in major decisions or events that are likely to affect the pro&not;ject's performance and products.</p>
<p>The competencies of task leaders and key project personnel should complement those of the project director. They should be people with demonstrated ability to meet dead&not;lines and to produce high quality products. They should have expertise that matches their assign&not;ed responsibilities on the project.</p>
<p>Key project staff includes the project director (and/or principal investigator), the associate project director, if applicable, the task leader for tasks 5 and 7 (recruit schools and teachers and collect data), the task leader for task 9 (produce dataset) and the task leader for tasks 10 and 11 (national data analysis plan and reporting; if different from project director). Any changes or substitutions of these key personnel requires advance approval by the Contracting Officer in consultation with the COR (see Key Personnel Clause).</p>
<p>g. The Related Corporate Experience section describes the offeror's capability and experience in the following areas: design and conduct of large-scale data collections; development and use of computer technology and soft&not;ware systems in support of large scale data collection&not;; design and development of large data bases; design and use of systems for processing, docu&not;menting, and maintaining large data bases; and design of survey instruments. Offerors may resubmit their statement of capabilities to satisfy the requirements of this section of their proposals.</p>
<p>Offerors should include in their proposal a matrix that clearly identifies which of its prior and ongoing corporate projects are demonstrative of its expertise in each of the above areas.</p>
<p>This section also contains a description of the approach that the offeror will use to provide corporate oversight for the project. This section includes detailed information on how project expenditures will be monitored and controlled. The specific steps that the offeror will take to ensure the quality of the work and products of its staff and to identify problems in performance should be clearly defined.</p>
<p>2. Business Proposal</p>
<p>The business proposal should include a separate price estimate for all tasks (tasks 1-13). The business proposal should be created in a way that allows for a review of price by task and by contract year. The business proposal should also include a summary price sheet that provides the total price associated with the offeror's proposal. The business proposal should include detailed price break-downs for staff, consultants, subcontractors, travel, supplies, computer costs, etc., for each of the core tasks.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance Report</p>
<p>Please Attachment C - Past Performance Form. Completed Contractor Performance Information forms from references are due on the same day as Technical &amp; Business Proposals under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the Contract Specialist by the due date for proposals. The past performance report should describe the offeror's past experience in conducting studies of a similar nature and magnitude. One-page abstracts of related work should be included which clearly identify the topics or issues addressed, the study design, the sample size and sample design, data collection methodologies, the time frame of the study and its current status (complete, ongoing, etc.). The name, current affiliation, and current telephone number of the sponsor's COR should be specified. These CORs may be asked to report their experience on the project (size, problems, overruns, responsiveness, flexibility, and product quality).</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: <br />(i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to nonpublic information through its performance on a government contract. <br />(ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. <br />(iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. &lsquo;&lsquo;Impaired objectivity'' includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: <br />(A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; <br />(B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or <br />(C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. <br />(2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. <br />(3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term &lsquo;&lsquo;potential conflict'' means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.<br />(b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if &lsquo;&lsquo;impaired objectivity'', or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest).<br />(c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest.<br />(d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. <br />(e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e).<br />(f) Conflict of Interest Certification. <br />The offeror, [insert name of offeror], hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Quote No. [insert number] that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term &lsquo;&lsquo;potential conflict'' means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).<br />Offeror's Name______________________<br />RFP/Contract No.____________________<br />Signature___________________________<br />Title_______________________________<br />Date_______________________________</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Project Title: Biomechanics Expert</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF TASK</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Industry is developing a new generation of industrial robots that are designed to work in human collaborative environments. At the same time, ISO 10218 WG3 is in the process of finalizing a new set of robot safety standards that include provisions for collaborative robot operation. As these two developments merge there is a significant need by industry for measurements and test methods to determine if this new generation of robots conforms to the revised robot safety standards that now allow human/robot collaboration. This project addresses the power and force limiting aspects of the standard. Power and force limiting is a robot function that performs a protective stop if any parameter limit is exceeded in the event that a robot makes contact with a human during collaborative operations. A protective stop is defined as an interruption of motion that allows a robot to continue after the stop while retaining program logic, and in the case of power and force limiting to facilitate an automatic continuance of a task when parameters fall below critical values.</p>
<p>The standard defines a set of medical/biomechanical requirements and parameters that include a defined human body model with multiple regions, relevant injury criteria for each region with their limit values, and characteristic values for the deformation constant, based on the assumption of linear deformation behavior of the established body regions. These permissible forces and surface pressures for the affected soft tissue individual body regions must be tested according to relevant collision area points after setting up a robotic workcell. The characteristic deformation and limit values currently in the standard were derived from work done by the German Institute for Occupational Safety (BGIA).</p>
<p>NIST is currently developing a device that replicates the deformation constants of the various body regions and measures static and dynamic collision forces in accordance with the BGIA recommendations. The results of the work will provide guidance and test procedures for using such a device as input into ISO Technical Specification TS15066. In addition, new studies are underway by BGIA in Germany to scale down the values of the injury criteria based on a human study involving pain thresholds. This human study began in September of 2011 and is expected to last 3 years. It is expected that the same injury criteria and soft tissue injury measures will be used; only the values will change.</p>
<p>Parallel to these international efforts, NIST has determined the need to take a step backward and review the validity of the current injury criteria, and investigate if alternative soft tissue injury criteria are available or can be derived. In addition, the current approach provides no guidance on human body dynamics and under free space collisions. NIST seeks guidance to establish independent free space collision criteria for use in conjunction with any soft tissue injury criteria chosen. Finally, based on the results of the injury criteria study, NIST is looking for conceptual designs for developing a test device that incorporates both the proposed injury criteria and free space collision criteria into a single test device. NIST's review of these designs could lead to future work to refine the selected design and build a prototype measurement system.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The work will provide NIST with the expertise in the area of biomechanics to determine the state-of-the-art in the development of human soft tissue injury criteria, free body dynamics of the human body, and associated test devices for determining the effects of robot collisions with humans in conjunction with the development of collaborative robot control strategies. The results of this work will be used by NIST in support of ISO 10218 and RIA/ANSI R15.06 Robot Safety Standards related work, specifically drafting of TS15066 Power and Force Limiting standards and performance measures.</p>
<p>Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>Task 1: The contractor shall perform the following reviews and document all findings in a report to NIST (Due July 30, 2012):<br />a. a review of the current approach taken in the development of the soft tissue injury criteria developed under the ISO 10218 robot safety standards effort [1][2][3] as well as current efforts to revise the injury criteria values based on a pain threshold study<br />b. a review of work to develop collision metrics in the area of human/robot collaboration <br />c. a review of the state-of-the-art in modeling human soft tissue properties with respect to impact levels delivered by an industrial robot.<br />d. attendance at ISO TC184/SC2 WG3 meeting Mainz, Germany (June 11-15, 2011)</p>
<p>Task 2: The contractor shall develop recommendations for improving the BGIA-developed soft tissue injury criteria based on available data and document all findings in a report to NIST. (Due Aug 30, 2012)</p>
<p>Task 3: The contractor shall develop a set of dynamic properties (i.e. mass, spring, damper) that represent the free body dynamics of the human body regions as defined by BGIA of varying poses when subjected to collisions from industrial robots. This work can be based on a literature search, computer models and/or experimentation. The contractor shall document all findings in a report to NIST (Due September 30, 2012)</p>
<p>Task 4: The contractor shall develop preliminary design concepts for an instrumented device that models soft tissue regions and human body dynamics for injury criteria measures (i.e. forces, deformations) relevant for robot collisions with humans and document all findings in a report to NIST (Due November 30, 2012)</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Facilities (ORF), Office of Acquisition (OA) has a requirement for the construction of the Northwest Child Care Center (NWCCC) to be located in Bethesda, Maryland.<br />Description of Requirement
<p>The NWCCC shall be a new, freestanding structure providing additional campus-wide capacity for daytime childcare. The primary objective is to create a center that provides necessary facilities for a safe and effective learning environment that is conducive to the well being of the children. This new facility must provide a welcoming appearance with a design that encourages positive identification with the facility, respects children's needs and abilities, and permits them to develop their potential in a safe and enriching environment.<br /><br />The NWCCC is intended to supplement the existing East Childcare Center as the need for daytime childcare has outgrown this existing facility. Additionally, new facilities at the northern portion of the NIH campus are needed to make childcare more convenient for parents who work in that area.</p>
<p>The center must have a licensed capacity to house up to 170 children, and be of approximately 21,000 gross square feet (15,274 net assignable square feet), and include complete site development (demolition and new construction) for parking facilities, utilities connections, building services, loading and receiving access, landscape features, pedestrian-ways (sidewalks), site lighting, security features, and functional playground suitable for certification (provide minimum required playground equipment).<br />The new facility must comply with NIH design guidelines and physical security criteria, GSA Childcare Center Design Guide, Code of Maryland ( Subtitle 16, Chapters 01-19, Child Care Centers ), governing fire safety and building codes, and must meet NAEYC accreditation.<br /><br />The contractor shall be responsible for delivering a project that is LEED accredited/certified and provides sustainable features to achieve flexibility, energy efficiency, for quality of environment. This NWCCC facility must qualify for LEED Silver rating, coordinated and obtained by the contractor.</p>
<p>Procurement strategy</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.3, NIH will employ source selection tradeoff procedures to procure and award the construction contract for this project. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly greater than cost or price. This is a Two Phase Design Build Selection Procedure in accordance with FAR 36.303-1(b). The selection process will have two phases. Phase I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Phase II. Phase II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value. <br /><br />In Phase I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors. Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may participate in Phase II of the procurement. Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase I will not be allowed to participate in Phase II of the procurement. After evaluating Phase I proposals, the Government shall select the most highly qualified offerors, not to exceed three (3).<br /><br /><br />In Phase II, the Government will issue the RFP to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Phase I that elect to participate in Phase II. The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers from the offerors in Phase II. The firm-fixed price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP. Based on the Phase I and Phase II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase I and Phase II offers without discussions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">CLIN 00001: Marine Safety Instructor Training.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>Statement of Work</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>Marine Safety Instructor Training for 2012</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>I. Background </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Section 403(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act directs the Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the states and the National Sea Grant College Program, to establish appropriate training programs for fishery observers and to ensure that they are competent to perform their mission.<strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In April 1999, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) contracted with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), to conduct a Needs Assessment Survey to determine the core competencies for fishery observer training programs.<span>&nbsp; </span>The survey addressed observer competency in such areas as vessel safety, fisheries science, and statistical analysis. <span>&nbsp;</span>Subsequent reviews of the national and regional observer programs resulted in further recommendations for improvements in observer safety training.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In January 2004, NMFS observer safety trainers met and developed safety training standards for all NMFS fisheries observers.<span>&nbsp; </span>These standards require that all observer safety trainers successfully complete a United States Coast Guard (USCG) approved MSIT course prior to conducting safety training. Currently certified trainers are also required to complete a 3-day refresher course every 3 years.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The objectives of this contract are to increase the number of regional observer training staff, increase the quality of safety training provided to observers by enhancing safety trainers&rsquo; methods of instruction in regional observer safety trainings, and maintain consistent observer safety training standards nationwide. In order to meet these objectives, the National Observer Program (NOP) is seeking a provider to conduct a United States Coast Guard (USCG) approved Marine Safety Instructor Training (MSIT) certification and refresher course.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This work statement provides for a MSIT course and refresher training for up to 20 observer trainers, to be conducted simultaneously.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>II. Observer Safety Training Tasks</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The NOP will contract a provider to simultaneously conduct a MSIT certification course (minimum of 40 hours) and refresher training (minimum of 24 hours) for up to 20 attendees, selected by NMFS, to be held in Woods Hole Massachusetts in early- to mid-July 2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall ensure all logistics for training are met, e.g. the use of a pool, vessels, and other facilities as needed. Topics will include, but are not limited to;</p>

<DESC>We currently have a 3 ton under running, single girder, crane. We would like to replace it with a 10 ton top running single girder crane.
<p>The crane is located outdoors, but in a partially enclosed, completely covered, carport type structure.</p>
<p>There are seven 6"x 6" I-beams that support seven steel trusses on one side and the trusses are bolted to the building on the other. This truss system supports the current three ton crane. The truss system also supports the roof and must be maintained in its' current position. The seven I-beams essentially create 6 bays of slightly different lengths, (see drawing). The lowest point of the roof trusses are along the I-beam side, which is 21'4", the high side is along the building which is 24'4". (See photos).</p>
<p>The existing crane will need to be removed. It entails removal of the two 102' lengths of I-beam, and the crane trolley itself. The Coast Guard will dispose of any scrap materials.</p>
<p>Due to the need of maintaining the current carport structure, a freestanding crane, built within the structure, may be required. If the 6"x6"vertical upright I-beams currently in place can support the new crane, it would be preferred. Otherwise new uprights will need to be placed next to and directly across from the seven existing 6"x 6" I-beams.<br />A lifting height 18' would be preferred.</p>
<p>I have attached photos and drawings, (with measurements), of our current layout. <br /><br />Point of contact for any technical related questions or concerns: Lee Neeman 415-399-3513</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB) believes that both the delivery of municipal services and the general state of Istanbul's disaster preparedness could be greatly improved through extensive consolidation of its existing Operations Centers.  At present, each municipal service (police, fire, transportation, electricity, gas, water/wastewater) runs its own Operations Center, and these employ a variety of often incompatible and non-interoperable hardware and software platforms.  The lack of interoperability among these Operations Centers severely impairs the municipal authority's ability to effectively respond to emergency and disaster situations.</p>
<p>Accordingly, IBB is planning to design, construct and operate a Consolidated Technology Center that would incorporate common platforms, systems and data sources for its Operations Centers to use, allowing for more coordinated approaches to service delivery.  Planning for the Technology Center has been entrusted to Office of the Chief Information Officer of IBB.  The Office has identified 41 Operations Centers to be consolidated, assembled baseline data regarding the scope of their operations, formulated a set of high-level objectives for the Project, and scoped a general framework for phasing and timing for the construction of the Technology Center.  USTDA has awarded this TA to IBB in order to provide IBB with the expertise and support it requires to plan and execute this high-priority project for the Municipality.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Information Officer for IBB has a staff of some 300 professionals, the majority of whom are professionally trained engineers.  IBB has the requisite capability to operate and maintain the consolidated Technology Center and associated telecommunications infrastructure once the project has been completed.  The project has already been approved by the local government, and land has been allocated for the construction of the Technology Center.  The municipality requires that the additional planning assistance included in this TA be completed before the project can be implemented.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $595,743 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp<br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, LOCAL TIME, on JUNE 1, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving&nbsp;fixture and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br /><br />The first&nbsp;fixture will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile.

<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage&nbsp;system will entirely replace the existing&nbsp;stationary storage fixtures. All fixtures except for the first fixture, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor. The first fixture will be on the same track but it will not be motorized.&nbsp;To secure the&nbsp;system tracking, small anchors may be installed into the concrete floor. Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;fixtures being replaced are shown in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; **UPDATE 4/27/2012**</strong></p>
<p>All salient characteristics described in the attached document titled "salient characteristics" shall take precedence over those in this description. In the event of conflicting information, the information defined in the "salient characteristics" document shall be relied upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

All work will be done during the working hours of 0700 to 1700 (7 am to 5 pm). We will provide all electrical work necessary. There are no prevaling wages for this buy. Additional lighting will not be necessary.<br /><br /><br />CORRECTION:<br />None of the existing&nbsp;fixtures will be part of this requirement. All fixtures will be removed. Therefore, it is no longer a requirement to match the existing shelving and doing so will not give you any sort of advantage since there will be no existing shelving by the time work begins.<br /><br />NOTICE:<br />The response date has been extended.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>**UPDATE 4/27/2012**</strong>
<p>All salient characteristics described in the attached document titled "salient characteristics" shall take precedence over those in this description. In the event of conflicting information, the information defined in the "salient characteristics" document shall be relied upon.</p>

This Combo Solicitation/Synopsis is being reissued to incorporate/define the size standard of a small business for this requirement.
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.102(f)(1), a concern is a small business if it has no more than 500 employees and furnishes the product of a small business.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>**UPDATE 2012**<br /><br /></strong>This ruling still applies, meaning, not only does your company have to be a small business, the manufacturer of your proposed product must be a small business as well.</p>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) ) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory S.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />(xii) <strong>FAR 52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (APR 2012)</strong></p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis of proposed contract action FA4452-12-R-0012. This is not a solicitation or invitation for offerors to submit proposals. Please note that all dates listed in this synopsis are tentative and are subject to change.<br />Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) Specialized Contracting Branch (A7KQ) intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for Executive Airlift Communications Network (EACN) support services. The government intends to issue the RFP on or around 14 May 12. This acquisition will be set-aside for small business (small business must accomplish at least 51% of the services performed) utilizing North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code of 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, with a size standard of $25.5M. <br />This is a competitive best value source selection using tradeoff process IAW FAR 15.101-1 and DFARS 215.3. The government will utilize performance/price tradeoff technique IAW AFFARS 5315.3 documented at MP 5315 AFFARS Library/Section M Templates/Approach #3 - Evaluate Technical, Rank by Price, Assess Performance until Proposal rated Substantial Confidence or all offers are evaluated. This technique is a simplified method that permits a tradeoff between price and performance in reaching the contract award decision. The government will award a contract resulting from the RFP to the contractor whose offer conforms to the RFP requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and provides the best value to the government. If the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price does not receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment rating, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated for a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment. The evaluation process will continue until an offer that is technically acceptable receives a performance confidence assessment rating of "Substantial Confidence" or all offers are evaluated. At this point, the evaluation is complete and the SSA proceeds to the integrated best value assessment of the evaluated offerors.<br /><br />The planned period of performance is as follows:<br />Base Period:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Oct 12 - 30 Sep 13<br />Option Period 1: 1 Oct 13 - 30 Sep 14<br />Option Period 2: 1 Oct 14 - 30 Sep 15<br />Option Period 3: 1 Oct 15 - 30 Sep 16<br />

<p>The technical point-of-contact for this effort is the Director, FCRP (fcrp-s201209info@src.org).</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is assisting the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO), a not-for-profit subsidiary of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC),  in publishing its research requirements, the purpose of which is to obtain the widest dissemination of the requirements.  The following information is for those wishing to respond to MARCO's solicitation entitled FCRP Research Announcement, Solicitation RA S201209.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION<br />The Focus Center Research Program ("FCRP"), a consortium of industrial participants and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"), (the "Consortium"), solicits white papers from U.S. universities for collaborative, multidisciplinary, multi-university research in selected areas of   principal interest.</p>
<p>The goal of this collaborative effort between the Department of Defense and the industrial participants is to increase substantially the unprecedented multi-decade record of uninterrupted performance improvement in information processing power and storage capacity of integrated circuits and related systems.  This historical advance in IC and related systems technologies resulted from research and development efforts that benefitted both the military and industrial sectors.  It has provided the Department of Defense with an unmatched technological edge in advanced weaponry and provided the U.S. economy with the productivity enhancements critical to U.S. economic growth.</p>
<p>The Consortium seeks to address emerging challenges in semiconductor and systems technologies by concentrating resources on high-risk, high-payoff, long-range innovative research to accelerate the productivity growth and performance enhancement of semiconductor integrated circuits and multi-scale systems.  To this end, the FCRP is focused on exploratory research beyond the horizons of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), and seeks to undertake off-Roadmap opportunities.                  <br /> <br />A two phase selection process will be used:</p>
<p>1.	First, a "proposers' conference" will be held to review this solicitation with interested university teams.  A white paper is then requested to outline a university team's proposal for a Center. These white papers will be reviewed by the Consortium, and the most promising will be selected to invite full proposals.  The university teams selected to submit full proposals may be given feedback by the Consortium on ways they could strengthen their proposal to meet the research goals, i.e., there will be an opportunity for these teams to discuss potential collaborations to create combined Centers.</p>
<p>2.	Second, full proposals for multi-university Centers will then be submitted for final selection for award by the FCRP Governing Council of the Consortium.  The selection timeline is given below:</p>
<p>Research Announcement Release	April 23, 2012<br />Bidders' Workshop		May 14, 2012		<br />White Papers Due:		June 15, 2012<br />Response to White Papers		July 9, 2012<br />Full Proposals Due		September 14, 2012<br />Proposals Selected for Award:	October 15, 2012<br />Contracts Completed		January 15, 2013<br />Launch Centers			January 15, 2013</p>
<p>This FCRP will be administered on behalf of the Consortium by the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation ("MARCO").  MARCO is a not-for-profit, special purpose entity established to support the Consortium participants.  It operates under the direction of the FCRP Governing Council and in support of the FCRP Science Advisory Board.  The Consortium participants will evaluate all proposals submitted in accordance with this Research Announcement and the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (http://www.src.org/compete/s201209/).   Selection of proposals for award shall be made by the Governing Council of the Consortium.</p>
<p>This solicitation is open to all U.S. universities and shall be conducted on a competitive basis.  Universities are encouraged to join together to achieve the depth and scope needed to address the technical content of this Research Announcement.  Proposed collaboration among PIs and universities, in the form of Centers or otherwise, should identify a lead university and lead PI for purposes of an award and consummation of a sponsored research agreement with the Consortium.</p>
<p>As a participating member of the Consortium, DARPA is bringing the FCRP Research Announcement to the attention of U.S. universities and is utilizing its own website (www.DARPA.mil) and the official federal acquisition opportunities website (www.FedBizOpps.gov) for this purpose.  In addition, this Research Announcement has been posted at http://www.src.org/compete/s201209/.</p>
<p>This Research Announcement represents a new phase in the continuing FCRP.  The Consortium intends to continue with the solicitation, contracting and reporting requirements that it has used in earlier program phases.</p>
<p>Cross-sharing between universities is strongly encouraged, but only U.S. institutions of higher education or their associated research institutions will be considered for funding.</p>
<p>The Consortium seeks proposals addressing one or more of the following seven focus technology areas which are organized into two major thrusts:</p>
<p>NEXT:  Highly Complex Systems</p>
<p>Technology Areas for NEXT - The mission of the NEXT thrust area is to enable highly complex systems with capabilities well beyond those available today, i.e., to augment beyond the "sum of the parts."</p>
<p>1.	High performance analog devices for high speed wireless, THz electronics for imaging, sensing, novel power devices:  New analog and mixed signal circuit architectures and techniques are needed that enable the efficient transmission (generation), reception (sensing), manipulation <br />and processing of analog signals (information) as well as conversion of analog signals to the digital domain.</p>
<p>2.	Vehicle and Distributed Sensor Networks:  Designs and implementation of integrated modular architecture (IMA) communication networks (i.e. distributed systems) are needed, including methodology and tools to support the choice of synchronous/asynchronous communication systems and the co-design of functionality and implementation platforms.</p>
<p>3.	Computing System Architectures based on CMOS technology:  Research is needed on highly parallel computing including data and interconnection architecture for nonconventional computing systems based on CMOS.</p>
<p>4.	Tools and methods for design, verification, and predictive modeling, including physical modeling:  Research is needed that explores and develops the tools that will enable realization of new systems, components, and technologies that will be developed in the 10 year timeframe.</p>
<p>ACCEL:  Semiconductor Technologies beyond CMOS</p>
<p>Technology Areas for ACCEL - The mission of the ACCEL thrust area is to identify and accelerate progress for new mainstream technologies beyond digital CMOS</p>
<p>1.	Nonconventional material systems: Research is needed for improved and novel materials that enable three basic technologies: analog, memory and logic devices.</p>
<p>2.	Quantum engineered devices and new sensors and transducers:  Next generation technologies based on exploiting quantum level physics to provide capabilities well beyond state-of-the-art.  Efforts should accelerate the integration of new material systems and quantum phenomena as the basis for the era beyond CMOS based devices.  Preference will be given to ideas that have a clear path towards stable use in applications, e.g., at room temperature and with minimal shielding.  Research is needed to identify new devices and sensors that can move the integrated circuit for computation and analog processing into the era of Beyond CMOS circuits.</p>
<p><br />3.	Integrated circuits and computing architectures based on novel devices including both digital and analog:  This research topic is chartered to find a new energy efficient architecture to replace the Von Neumann Computer Architecture and to optimize the overall performance and energy usage by optimally partitioning the computational system between signal processing in the analog domain at an I/O interface, and computation in the digital domain.</p>
<p>Each of these areas is of equal technical importance for proposal purposes.  Offerors may propose innovative research in one or more areas.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the RA S201209 FCRP Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced above.</p>
<p>Additionally, a separate solicitation may be offered at a later date for exploratory, individual project proposals in areas related to these thrusts.</p>
<p>PROGRAM SCOPE <br />Following proposal selection, awards pursuant to sponsored research agreements with the Consortium will be made as appropriate, for base periods of up to five years, to accommodate student education and provide adequate time for discovery and progress in new areas.  The research is expected to start in January 2013.  There will be a checkpoint at 2.5 years to allow for re-direction as needed within the Centers; this will not be a re-competition.  Overall program funding may reach a level of $40M per annum, depending on research progress and availability of funds.  The funds may not be equally divided among Awardees.  The technical point-of-contact for this effort is the Director, FCRP (fcrp-s201209info@src.org).</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />Proposers should review the document entitled "RA S201209 FCRP Proposer Information Pamphlet", which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluations, funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the web site at http://www.src.org/compete/s201209/pip-S201209.pdf, by electronic mail (fcrp-s201209info@src.org), or by U.S. mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  White papers and subsequent proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Offerors must submit all white papers and proposals as a single pdf document via the SRC FCRP Web Site.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to procure commercial item services under (FAR Part 12 and FAR 15) for VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network (VISN 22). VISN 22 is comprised of five (5) Medical Centers, including VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS), VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHS), VA Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHS), VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) and VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System (VASNHS). The NAICS code is 624229, Size Standard is $7 Million.     

Contractor(s) shall assist with the provision of housing placement and case management services through the HUD -VASH  Program. Through these contracts, the VA seeks to expedite the placement of HUD-VASH Veterans and their families with HUD Section Eight Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV) in affordable, permanent housing and assist them in maintaining housing thereafter with case management services. HUD-VASH Veterans are admitted to the program based on a demonstrated need for ongoing case management due to mental health, substance abuse, medical and/or other co-occurring serious psychosocial issues.  The program prioritizes Veterans assessed to be highly vulnerable with a high likelihood of death due to homelessness.

The contracts shall include case management services, which are comprised of social workers, case managers, and para-professional counselors. The case management portion shall entail assisting the Veterans with retaining housing through therapeutic services, life skills education, and routine counseling sessions.  The housing placement component shall be led by a housing specialist, usually a real estate broker, who is familiar with the nuances associated with HUD Section 8 housing. THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT FOR HOUSING, BUT FOR CASE MANAGEMENT AND HOUSING PLACEMENT SERVICES.

 The contract(s) shall be for a base year with the Government's option to exercise four (4) one (1) year option periods.  This solicitation shall be unrestricted.  The solicitation will be available for issue on or about April 30, 2012 with offers due on or about May 21, 2012.

<NTYPE>PRESOL
<CONTACT>Brad Heath

<a href="mailto:Heath.Brad@epa.gov">Brad Heath</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  THE ACTUAL SOLICITATION SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON OR ABOUT MAY 4, 2012, AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE:  http://epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water (OW), Office of Science and Technology (OST), Engineering and Analysis Division (EAD) requires contractor support to provide environmental engineering support for clean water regulations.  Specifically, the contractor will be required to provide support in the following areas:  technical and analytical support; cost and benefit analysis; programmatic support including document preparation; review of public comments and peer review; litigation technical support; database management; support in chemical analytical methods and toxicity tests relating to the requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and other related mandates; multimedia analysis; and implementation of effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) and standards including compliance and enforcement to the OW/OST/EAD in support of the Agency's requirements relative to the provisions of the CWA.  This environmental engineering support is expected to i nclude professional program managers, engineers, scientists, technicians and administrative services with experience in CWA regulations, industrial wastewater treatment and monitoring and pollution prevention technologies.  
Due to the nature of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, it is anticipated that Offerors with the expertise to perform these services could also have relationships (including a parent/subsidiary/sister company affiliation or an existing contract relationship) which presents a potential significant organizational conflict of interest (OCOI).  It is the EPA's contention that a significant OCOI would exist if award were to be made to entities within the following groups:
1)  Entities that discharge processed water, or provide treatment of wastewater or drinking water; 2)  Entities that manufacture/sell/import water treatment chemicals and/or equipment (including point-of-use/point-of-entry treatment devices);3)  Entities that provide advisory and/or technical services relating to waste minimization, waste management, and wastewater treatment and control;  4)  Entities acting in a consulting, advisory, or legal capacity with, or for, organizations trying to overturn or circumvent the regulations which are the intended outcome of this contract; and/or 5)  Entities that own or operate industrial and/or community water systems. 
The solicitation shall also include the clause entitled LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (LOFC) (Headquarters Support), (EPAAR 1552.209-74) (APR 2004), (Alt V).  Paragraph (c) which states in part, "The contractor and any subcontractors, during the life of this contract plus five years beyond the life of this contract, shall be ineligible to enter into business or financial relationships which would support or affect any efforts to contest, oppose, or influence the contents of regulations, policies, limitations, standards or criteria relating to the Clean Water Act (CWA); the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1986 (CERCLA); the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); or the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1988 (FIFRA), for which it has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide technical and administrative  support under this contract, without prior written authorization from the cognizant EPA contracting officer."  Be advised, however, that the afore-mentioned limitations may change when the RFP is released.
The Government anticipates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract with a total level of effort of 250,000 hours (if all option quantities are exercised) over an ordering period of five (5) years.  The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $14 million.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available on or about April 27, 2012, on the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) Contracts website located at http://epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ (under Solicitations and Amendments) with a closing date on or about May 31, 2012.  Anticipated award date of the resultant contract is no later than September 26, 2012.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the solicitation for changes or updates.  
A Draft PWS document and a Draft Non-EPAAR Clauses document shall accompany this Presolicitation Notice via separate attachment.  See http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ (under Synopses-RFPs Not Issued) for this entire presolicitation package.  Be advised that changes to any or all documentation is possible when the final RFP is released.  No hard copies will be available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The point of contact is Brad Heath at (513)-487-2352 or heath.brad@epa.gov.

<DESC>Introduction: The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA), Office of Acquisition and Operations (OAO), Strategic Acquisitions Center (SAC), Fredericksburg VA is issuing a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information for Service Dog Insurance. THIS IS NOT AN ORDER, SOLICITATION, OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation for services. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this announcement. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized and posted at www.fbo.gov. 

Your response to this Sources Sought announcement will assist the VA in determining the best acquisition solution to ensure robust competition, and ultimately the best valued solution for the VA Service Animal Health Insurance requirement. This announcement is specifically targeted for interested, qualified businesses that can provide animal health insurance across the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and potentially the Philippines. 

Background: Service/guide dogs are considered a prosthetic device in the VA system. They serve as a critical component of rehabilitation and can be part of the treatment plans for Disabled Veterans. Veterans that acquire service and guide dogs for significant visual, hearing, and mobility impairments may apply for and be awarded VHA veterinary benefits under current regulations. Just as we would maintain or repair another prosthetic device, we provide payment for veterinary care for service/guide dogs. We are seeking a vehicle such as pet insurance to control costs and maintain consistency. 

Objectives: 
Award Service Animal Health Insurance contract vehicle(s) to provide comprehensive commercial medical insurance coverage for service dogs of eligible veterans. Currently, there are approximately 600 dogs that are part of this program. This number is likely to increase. 

The animal medical insurance provider shall accept "all comers". Thereby, all dogs will be covered under the policy regardless of breed, age, and the hereditary conditions associated with them. 

The insurance will ensure that the VA, not the veteran, be billed for any premiums, copayments, or deductibles associated with the policy. 

The policy will feature dental coverage (sedated teeth cleaning when necessary) for all service dogs. 

The policy will cover both well dog and emergency care for all service dogs.

Well Dog coverage will include: 
--Yearly check-up/physical 
--Dental coverage, i.e., teeth cleaning (with sedation when deemed necessary) 
--Immunizations 

Emergency Care will include coverage for: 
--All pre-existing conditions such as hip dysplasia, 
--Diagnostic tests, surgeries, prescription medications, (including hereditary and congenital disorders) 
--Euthanasia and cremation services 

For additional information on the requirement, please see the Federal Register posting at: https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/06/16/2011-14933/service-dogs

Questions: 

What is the feasibility of providing medical insurance coverage to all dogs, regardless of breed, age, and hereditary conditions? Is there an established age range for working dogs? 

Would it be more efficient and effective to provide insurance on a regional basis? Market research has indicated animal insurance prices are relative to geographic location. What is the geographic range your company can cover? What are limitations of an insurance company providing coverage overseas? 

In responding to this announcement please include the following: 
Name of Company 
Contact Information 
Business Size: Please indicate your business size (Large or Small). If you happen to be a small business, please indicate your size standard and small business socio-economic sub-categories that represent your business; are you a Service Disable Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman-Owned? Indicate any sub-categories that apply. 

Interested parties may respond to this notice via e-mail to 
jesse.hardy@va.gov 
and 
regina.mcgregor@va.gov. 

Responses are requested by February 16, 2012.

The animal medical insurance provider shall accept "all comers". Thereby, all dogs will be covered under the policy regardless of breed, age, and the hereditary conditions associated with them.  Please note, due to the investment of time and money into the extensive training of service dogs, dogs that enter a service dog program are examined, tested and screened by a Veterinarian prior to the training program.  Once in training, the dogs are followed at regular intervals to ensure the best health when placed with a Veteran handler.  Dogs of this caliber should be considered very healthy and negative for a hereditary condition.

The insurance will ensure that the VA, not the veteran, be billed for any premiums, copayments, or deductibles associated with the policy. 

The policy will feature dental coverage (sedated teeth cleaning when necessary) for all service dogs.

The project will build on the successes of its predecessor MARKETS project in addressing constraints along the agricultural commodity value chain, working with farmers to increase production and the quality of produce through improved post-harvest handling, linking farmers and agro-processors, providing incentives to adopt improved technology along the value chain, producing value-added products and identifying new markets.

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. This solicitation requires offerors of such products to submit all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to enable the government to determine whether the alternate product is either identical to or physically, mechanically, electronically, and functionally interchangeable with the product specified.

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. All parts shall be NEW approved parts.

Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
