<ARCHDATE>03222008
<CONTACT>Dennis Scanlon, 202-267-9422
<DESC>This is a public announcement.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Mosaic ATM, Inc., (Mosaic) to provide systems engineering in support of maturing system requirements pertaining to Surface Decision Support System Capabilities (SDSS) for the Advanced Technology Development & Prototyping Group (ATO-P). This contract will allow the FAA to proceed with requirements development on behalf of the maturing Surface Decision Support System capabilities while meeting internal agency goals and outside commitments to international partners.  A single source contract for a twelve month period of performance in the amount of approximately $1.8M is being pursued.  This contract will also carry four one-year Option Periods, valued at approximately $1.8M per period. The FAA conducted a Market Analysis, released November 15, 2007, through the FAA Contracting Opportunities webpage.  Because of the highly specialized nature of this requirement, and in order to identify qualified respondents, the Market Survey included a series of specific technical questions each respondent was required to answer.  In addition, the Market Survey included notice of the FAA's need for a contractor that could begin work immediately and one that was willing to waive its eligibility to compete on future systems acquisitions if awarded this requirement. Mosaic was the only respondent to the Market Survey that clearly established the ability to commence work immediately and the only qualified respondent that agreed to be excluded from derivative Surface Traffic Management (STM) acquisitions.  Both of these criteria are critical to the success of the FAA's effort hereunder.  The Agency has commitments, to its internal goals and to international partners in the AIRE Program, that it will conduct demonstrations of the SDSS capability, by May 2008.  In particular, only Mosaic provided staff resumes showing its existing personnel who are qualified to start work with no lead time required.  Furthermore, of the potentially qualified responders to the Market Analysis, only Mosaic affirmatively identified its willingness to sign an Exclusion from Future Agency Contracts, which is important because SDSS requirements will be integral to any competitive STM system deployment. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement and a Sole Source Justification has been approved.

					SECTION 1
SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of the twelve health agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program (NIA IRP) Gerontology Research Center (GRC) is an NIH installation located at 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, Baltimore, Maryland. The Contractor shall provide Rigging Services for the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI) of the NIA IRP.  The move will be from the GRC at 5600 Nathan Shock Drive to the Biomedical Research Center, a new building located across the street from GRC.

There are three labs included this scope, each housing a Bruker BioSpin NMR/MRI scanner:
?	DMX 400 Spectrometer
?	7T/30 USR BioSpec Spectrometer 
?	ABX 1.9T/30 BioSpec Spectrometer
In addition to the magnets, the electronic racks and the UPS for each of the spectrometers listed above are the following ancillary equipment:
?	ABX: Step-up transformer, UPS bypass switch, Bruker power distributor (PDU) and the console desk
?	DMX: Step-up transformer, Powerex 5 HP air compressor, compressed air tank
?	7T/30: Step-up transformer, UPS bypass switch, Bruker power distributor (PDU), console desk, Cryomech helium compressor, Thermo Neslab HX-300 chiller and Thermo Neslab Merlin M75 chiller.

The electronic racks for all three instruments are from Bruker Biospin.  The DMX400 has one dual rack and three single racks; the ABX 1.9T has one dual and one single rack; the 7T/30 has three single racks. The DMX400 magnet was manufactured by Magnex Scientific; the 7T/30 magnet is from Bruker Biospin and the ABX magnet is from Oxford Instruments.


1.2 Description of the New Facility and Location 

The NIH Biomedical Research Center (BRC) is a replacement facility for a portion of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The NIA?s Intramural Research program (IRP) is located primarily on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center campus in Baltimore, MD in various buildings.  The magnets involved will be relocated to the Basement level (level 0) of the BRC.

An air shaft has been constructed on the outside of the new building leading to the Basement level. Due to the size and weight of the 7T/30 magnet, the delivery of the magnet can only be done through this shaft.  Both the DMX and the ABX 1.9T magnets should fit in the freight elevator once crated.
     
  The following table shows approximate elevator dimensions and capacities in the BRC:

	Passenger Elevators	Freight Elevators
Door Dimensions	3?-6? x 7?-0?	4?-6? x 7?-0?
Inside Dimensions of Cab	Need to verify	Need to verify
Weight Capacity	3,500 lbs.	6,500 lbs.
Site measurements will need to be taken by the Contractor.

1.3 Service Requirement Overview

?	Due to the sensitivity of the equipment, a knowledgeable contractor and means of effective communication shall be required to ensure the requirements are met.  The Contract support teams must be skilled and precise in relocating large, sensitive MRI and NMR magnets.  All NIH contracts shall be treated with the highest levels of professionalism especially when directly interacting with the Move Coordinator and NIH staff in the workplace as well as with researchers in the laboratories.

?	Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, vehicles, equipment, licenses, permits, insurances, subcontracts, management, expertise and other resources necessary to transport government owned property between the two locations.

The contractor must be able to schedule up to a month before the actual move and respond in a timely manner.  The sequence of this move is dependent on several time sensitive factors that will be coordinated by the Move Coordinator and NIH.

1.4	Schedule Overview

Rigging services will commence once the Faraday cages for the ABX 1.9T/30 and 7T/30 instruments are in place and have been tested. 

Unlike at the GRC, all three magnets will be relocated to an open floor plan and will all be housed in one room. A floor plan of the new layout will be provided. 

Due to the existing location of the 7T/30 in the GRC building, a large crane will probably need to park on a Johns Hopkins emergency route on Nathan Shock Drive. To minimize disturbance to activities on the hospital campus, work will need to be performed early in the morning on a weekend. NIH will make the appropriate arrangements with Johns Hopkins security concerning road closures/detours. Johns Hopkins does not provide flaggers; this shall be provided by the contractor.

An up-to-date underground utilities plan for the roadway separating the BRC from the GRC and the roadway in front of ARC and NIDA will be provided to the Contractor in order to plan the location of heavy equipment so as not to endanger buried utilities.




					








    SECTION 2
SCOPE OF WORK

2.1	Pre-Move:

?	In cooperation with the Move coordinator and Lab Manager, the Contractor shall develop and submit a relocation plan. 
?	The Move Coordinator shall provide the confirmed schedule to the Contractor two weeks prior to the move.
?	The Contractor shall verify all site conditions prior to the move. If any concerns arise, the Contractor must notify the Move Coordinator and Lab Manager two weeks prior to the move.
?	The magnets will be completely de-energized, secured and crated under separate contracts with their respective manufacturers or third-party contractors, as appropriate for each magnet.    

2.2      Move:

?	The Contractor shall provide all materials and supplies required for packaging/crating the 1.9T magnet.  Bruker will prepare and pack the 7T/30 and DMX 400.
?	The DMX 400 and 1.9T magnets can be crated and removed from their current locations via the GRC?s hallways, freight elevators and loading dock.
?	The 7T/30 magnet will need to be lifted out of an existing roof hatch located on the outside of the GRC building on the patio separating the GRC and ARC buildings.
?	During transportation, as recommended by Bruker, the magnet is lifted by the packing crate, using either a fork lift or crane. The Contractor shall provide forklift trucks capable of lifting more than 7000 Kg.  Any crane and equipment used to move the magnet must have a safe working load equal to, or greater than, 7000 kg minimum. Lifting and lowering must be carried out slowly, smoothly and in a controlled fashion.  Driving also must be at a slow speed. 
?	The Contractor shall move the system on air pads, but if unavailable, skates may be used. If skates are used, the surface must be leveled, which may mean laying plates on the floor before moving the magnet.  The system must be supported on the pads under the feet of the cryostat.  This must be carried out by experienced personnel. The system must not be allowed to fall off the pad or skate, but must be gently lowered to the floor.
Bending of support constructions and inclines by more than 2 mm must be avoided.
 In the new location the Faraday cages will be built with removable panels to allow the magnet to be moved in horizontally. Per specifications, the 7T/30 magnet cannot be tilted more than 3 degrees during movement. 

2.4 	PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OVERALL SUPERVISION

After award, an orientation/kick-off meeting with the Contractor(s) will be scheduled with the Move Coordinator and the Lab Manager.  The agenda for the orientation meeting is to include but is not limited to: communication and coordination responsibilities and procedures, finalizing master move plan, proposed project schedule and scheduling required for future meetings.

Qualifications

Qualified personnel shall be provided by the Contractor to accomplish the tasks listed herein.  All contractor personnel involved in handling and the transporting the magnets must be familiar with Bruker magnets or similar equipment and have experience moving cold (cryogen-filled) superconducting NMR or MRI magnets of similar weight and size.

2.5 GENERAL DUTIES AND REQUIREMENTS

 General Handling and Lifting Procedures:
  
(7T/30) per Bruker
The Bruker USR magnets are designed to be sufficiently strong and to be shipped without disassembly and in cold condition, thus the strength is optimized so as not to affect the cryogenic performance.  However, care must be exercised when handing the magnet since abnormal forces due to faulty careless handling practices may damage the system.
All lifting and moving of the magnet containing cryogenic gases (liquid cryogens) must be carried out by trained personnel and under no circumstances may the system be dropped or skidded along the floor because these actions may damage the magnet system.
The magnet must be moved in an upright position by using appropriate transportation means.  When moving the magnet it shall not be tilted more than 3 degrees.
With any type of movement the resulting acceleration forces must be smaller than 2.0g.  When movement occurs in the vertical direction alone, forces up to 3.0g can be tolerated.  However, in such cases no acceleration whatsoever may be experienced simultaneously in another direction.

The system must not impact other objects when traversing. The transport lugs should not experience any lateral forces.

Road Transportation

?	The magnet must be transported on air ride trucks only
?	The magnet must be completely de-energized
?	The magnet system must be secured by the transport rod which is screwed into the helium neck
?	Each He-exhaust-port must be sealed with a 20 mbar non return (one-way safety exhaust) valve
?	2g- and 5g- shock indicators must be rigidly attached to the cryostat.
?	The magnet system must be placed on the motor vehicle.  MUST NOT BE PLACED ON THE TRAILER
?	The axis of the magnet bore must be perpendicular to the direction of travel of the truck
?	The cryomagnet system must be safely secured against slippage
?	The cryomagnet system must be safely secured against tilting
?	The cryomagnet system must be safely protected against accidental collision with any other part of the load on the truck

Due to the sensitivity of the 7T/30 and the supporting equipment, the contractor shall specify in the proposal how to overcome four potential pitfalls: 
?	The magnet will need to be transported over an 8? threshold at the entry doors of the BRC, located at the bottom of the access shaft.
?	The magnet will need to be moved horizontally through the delivery panel of the new Faraday cage, which has a 1.5? step up from the floor slab to the cage floor.  Note any special design features (e.g. overhead beams, lifting points, etc.) that may need be built into the new Faraday cage to allow access for magnet delivery.
?	Relocating the APC UPS associated with the 7T/30 without taking down any walls in the GRC.
?	Removing the HX-300 chiller out of the GRC basement
(ABX)	
Specific Handling instructions will be provided 

(DMX)
Specific Handling instructions will be provided
Security Requirements

The Contractor shall take precautions to ensure that the security of all NIH personnel, research programs, facilities, property, data, record and materials are not jeopardized by contract operations.

Johns Hopkins Security requirements will be provided to the contractor

Insurance  (see Attachment 1)


2.6  Site
Site access requirements and restrictions are as follows: 
?	While on NIH installations, the Contractor vehicles shall be parked only in areas designated for such vehicles by the NIA IRP Security Officers and Johns Hopkins campus police.               
?	Drivers shall not drink, eat or smoke while operating vehicles on NIH installations nor drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The Contractor crew shall only use designated elevators for the movement of shipping containers between building floors.

<SUBJECT>A -- Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)  Coordinating Center

<DESC>Title: Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Coordinating Center

The NHLBI is seeking a central Coordinating Center (CC) for a new nine-year multicenter clinical trial entitled Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). SPRINT will include 4 to 6 Clinical Center Network (CCN) hubs, with approximately 10-30 clinical sites per hub, which will be solicited under a separate Request for Proposals (RFP).  

SPRINT is a randomized, multi-center clinical trial testing the effects of intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Approximately 7,500 participants will be randomized into either the lower SPB goal of less than 120 mmHg (intensive treatment group) or the standard SPB goal of less than 140 mmHg (control group).  Participants will be 55 years or older with SPB greater than or equal to 130 mmHg and at least one additional CVD risk factor.  Only two high risk groups will be excluded: patients with diabetes and those who have had a stroke because they are the target groups of other ongoing NHLBI and NINDS trials that are testing a lower BP goal. SPRINT will focus on three other high risk groups: patients with clinical CVD other than stroke, patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients without clinical CVD who have other CVD risk factors such as low levels of HDL. In SPRINT, there will be a subgroup of 3,500 people with stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2). The primary composite endpoints will be CVD mortality and non-fatal MI, stroke, and heart failure.  Several secondary outcomes will be examined, such as markers of renal functioning in non-CKD participants, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. It is possible that the study may be expanded to include additional secondary clinical endpoints, or additional treatment strategies to achieve the standard and lower SBP treatment goals.

There will be a one year protocol development phase, followed by the recruitment of participants over a 2 year period.  Participants will be followed for a total of four to six years.  Post follow-up there will be a two year period for close out, analysis, reporting, and dissemination.  Data to be collected includes demographics, medical history, physical examinations, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs), as well as psychosocial, economic, and lifestyle questionnaires and data. SPRINT will include 4 to 6 Clinical Center Network (CCN) hubs, with approximately 10-30 clinical sites per hub, which will be solicited under RFP-NHLBI-HC-09-05, and will be available on the FedBizOpps Web site on or about February 29, 2008. Offerors interested in submitting proposals for the Coordinating Center should read the RFP for the CCNs to gain a better understanding of the study. Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants.  In addition, it is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT:  a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program. Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee. The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed. The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Coordinating Center will: 

1. be responsible for the statistical design of the study and provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for randomizing study subjects, for study monitoring, and for the management and analysis of study data;
2. develop operational and analytical methodology; provide administrative guidance, oversight, and support for SPRINT as a whole;
3. coordinate protocol writing activities, including protocol drafting and finalization; develop, design, and distribute study forms and a manual of operations; ensure that the provisions of the manual of operations are carried out by the CCNs and the clinical sites; 
4. establish the Drug Distribution Center (DDC) and two core laboratories: the Central Laboratory and the ECG Reading Center; the DDC will package, label, and dispense drugs according to the study protocol and will also monitor compliance and provide data to the CC for further analyses; the Central Laboratory will arrange for the analysis of blood and urinary measurements, provide interpretation of blood measurements, and collect and store blood samples for biomarker and DNA analysis; the ECG Reading Center will provide a central interpretation laboratory of resting ECG; core laboratories will be responsible for developing and distributing specific measurement procedures, timely data gathering, analysis under the leadership from the CC, and providing data to the CC for central analyses;
5. maintain quality control at participating Clinical Center Networks (CCN), and monitor their performance status; promote interactions among the CCNs, coordinating study activities among the CCNs and core laboratories, and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; train CCNs and core laboratories in standardized protocol implementation and data collection; provide rapid feedback to the CCNs and core laboratories on the quality of data submitted and proposed corrections; conduct periodic visits to each CCN in order to monitor and assure high performance throughout the trial;
6. make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair and to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 
7. coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the DSMB and other meetings related to the conduct of the overall trial;
8. facilitate communications among all organizational study components during each phase of the trial, including the Protocol Review Committee (PRC), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and trial-wide subcommittees, such as the ancillary/substudy, mortality/morbidity, operational, publications, and adherence subcommittees; prepare and distribute minutes and reports of the Steering Committee, Executive Committee, PRC, and DSMB meetings, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data collection and report content;
9. establish and maintain a computer system, secure database, and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data (including blood samples and ECGs) collected from up to 120-180 separate clinical sites; also provide for the central interpretation of quality of life and costs data collected on subsamples of participants;
10. develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of SPRINT information, documents, and forms to the CCNs; develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about SPRINT for the lay public;
11. prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating CCNs, the project officer, the contracting officer, and others identified as key partners by the project officer;
12. review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy, addressing such issues as recruitment progress and certification of new clinical sites;
13. monitor end point results, morbidity and mortality data, and adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study; and
14. design and implement a plan for study closeout, analysis, and dissemination, including final data collection, verification, analytical support for scientific writing groups,  publication of study results, and plans for the investigators? dissemination of study results. 

The CC will frequently need to make complex and rapid decisions and assist the study leadership and the DSMB in their decision-making process. These decisions will often be based on medical information obtained from the clinics and developments in the scientific literature and other sources of information, such as the FDA.  Therefore, CC staff will need to be highly experienced, with strong medical and scientific qualifications and credibility, and have specialized experience relating to hypertension, clinical cardiology, and nephrology.  The CC must have biostatistical and information technology expertise, including the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, economic, and medical morbidity and mortality data, and to develop and maintain a complex website and computer system.  CC staff must be experienced coordinating several long term, complex, large scale, multi-site clinical events trials lasting more than four years.  This experience should include managing subcontracts with a DDC or core laboratories.  The medical monitor for the CC should be board certified in internal medicine with substantial experience in the clinical management of hypertension, and have significant experience in large scale multi-site events clinical research trials.  The CC must develop highly productive working relationships with the CCNs, core laboratories, academic researchers, NHLBI Project Office, advisory groups (e.g., DSMB), and clinical sites.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be awarded for 9 years with a period of performance beginning on or about August 31, 2009.  The Request for Proposals, numbered RFP-NHLBI-HC-09-05, will be available on or about February 29, 2008 on the FedBizOpps Web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. See the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Rockledge Drive Bethesda postings. Proposals will be due on or about May 30, 2008. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

It is possible that the study may be expanded to include additional secondary clinical endpoints, or additional treatment strategies to achieve the standard and lower SBP treatment goals.

There will be a one year protocol development phase, followed by the recruitment of participants over a 2 year period.  Participants will be followed for a total of four to six years.  Post follow-up there will be a two year period for close out, analysis, reporting, and dissemination. Data to be collected includes demographics, medical history, physical examinations, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs), as well as psychosocial, economic, and lifestyle questionnaires and data. It is anticipated that there will be approximately 4-6 CCN hubs with approximately 10-30 clinical sites per hub. Clinical sites will be medical facilities or individual practices that will be involved in the evaluation, enrollment, and treatment of patients in the trial.  In addition, SPRINT will include a central Coordinating Center (CC) that will be solicited under a separate request for proposals, RFP-NHLBI-HC-09-04, which will be available on the FedBizOpps Web site on or about February 29, 2008. Potential offerors for the CNNs should read the RFP for the CC to gain a better understanding of the study. Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants. It is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT: a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

Each CCN will be responsible for timely recruitment and clinical care quality assurance activities in accordance with the SPRINT protocol. Each CCN will develop an appropriate subcontract arrangement with each clinical site. It is anticipated that the trial will use a per capitation reimbursement model for all or nearly all of the clinical sites in the study. In addition, the CCN will provide the network's scientific leadership and operational management. The clinical sites within the CCN will collect data at the local level in accordance with the study protocol and the manual of operations (MOP), and will coordinate each participant's hypertension treatment.

Each CCN will be responsible for recruiting a minimum of between 1,250 to 1,875 patients, including meeting study-wide goals for recruitment of women and specific minorities (African Americans, Hispanic, Native American, Asian), and for study-wide goals with regard to patients with cardiovascular disease and stage 3 CKD.  The CCN will have the primary responsibility for timely evaluation and correction of recruitment problems, including development and implementation of alternative strategies to achieve the stipulated goals, and funding the related activities. It is anticipated that each CCN will conduct at least yearly site visits within its network of clinical sites to supervise recruitment activities and assure high quality performance. The CCN activities will be coordinated with the CC, and may include site visits conducted by the CC, along with other organizational components of the study, leading to certification of new sites, cessation of recruitment at existing sites, and appropriate follow-up of patients enrolled from sites whose recruitment is stopped. Each CCN will closely collaborate with and assist the CC in implementation and standardization of the protocol within their network.  

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program. Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee. The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed. The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Clinical Center Network will: 

1. propose and present to the Steering Committee a step treatment drug regimen for the blood pressure strategy and for background therapy (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic); collaborate with other CCNs, the Coordinating Center (CC), other central units (DDC, core laboratories), and the Project Office in finalizing the protocol and the manual of procedures (MOP), which includes detailed intervention and measurement descriptions and staff training procedures,
2. have or develop a communication system within the CCN, including Internet capability; this system should include means of assisting the CC in facilitating data gathering links between the CCN and central units;
3. have or obtain IRB clearance/assurances for all participating sites within the network, including an approved informed consent document;
4. assist the CC in training and monitoring staff within the CCN in uniform protocol implementation, and in following the MOP for standardization of protocol-directed procedures and data collection; clinical centers within the CCN will send appropriate measurements (e.g., blood samples, ECGs) to the CC and applicable core laboratories (e.g., Central Laboratory, ECG Reading Center) in a timely fashion, as specified in the protocol and MOP; collaborate with the CC in correcting problems with missed, delayed, and erroneous data at the respective clinical sites within the CCN;
5. recruit, randomize, manage, and follow up a minimum of 1,250 to 1,875 patients according to the study protocol and MOP; address recruitment shortfalls in a timely fashion; participate with the CC and other CCNs in classifying clinical events in study patients;
6. collect and maintain appropriate data files, and maintain appropriate confidentiality and security of these files at the respective clinical sites;
7. provide timely data on recruitment and measurements to the CC; recruitment data should include numbers of participants screened and numbers randomized, and should be categorized by gender and race; 
8. arrange and lead meetings for CCN clinical site personnel; participate in study-wide meetings and committees, providing information and experts as needed;
9. assist the CC in capturing major adverse drug effects in a timely fashion to maximize patient safety, and promptly report serious adverse drug events and unanticipated problems from the appropriate clinical site, through the CCN leadership, to the Project Office and the CC, according to the protocol and the MOP;
10. ascertain and respond to clinical alerts in data measured or interpreted within the CCN, and respond to clinical alerts reported by the CC or core laboratories;
11. participate in preparing publications in collaboration with other study investigators, the CC, and the NHLBI Project Office;
12. provide a concise final report which will serve as a technical reference document, describing all of the phase activities; and
13. assist the clinical sites in collecting event outcome data (e.g. hospitalizations records).

The CCN will assist the CC, the study leadership, and the DSMB in their complex decision making process. These decisions will often be based on medical information obtained from the clinics and developments in the scientific literature and other sources of information, such as the FDA. Therefore, CCN staff will need to be highly experienced, with strong medical and scientific qualifications and credibility, and have experience relating to hypertension and internal medicine, or clinical cardiology or nephrology. CCN staff must be experienced coordinating several long term, complex, large scale multi-site clinical events trials lasting more than four years. This experience should include managing subcontracts with at least 10-30 clinical sites, and extensive specialty care of patients with hypertension. The medical monitor for the CCN should be board certified in internal medicine with substantial experience in the clinical management of hypertension, and have significant experience in large scale multi-site events clinical research trials. The CCN must develop highly productive working relationships with the CC, clinical sites, core laboratories, academic researchers, NHLBI Project Office, and advisory groups (e.g., PRC, DSMB).

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates awarding one or more contract(s) to an organization or organizations to provide analytical laboratory services for analysis of environmental samples for the National Children's Study (NCS).  One or more fixed unit price type contract(s) with a four ( 4 ) year base and one (1)  one-year option period of performance are anticipated. Further detail will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement.  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.

Background information on the Study is available on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on child health and development.  The Study's goal is to better understand how environmental exposures and genetic factors interact to affect children's health and development.  It will explore the effects of a broad range of environmental factors, including biological, chemical, physical, and psychosocial environmental influences.  Gene expression and gene-environment interaction will be important aspects of the Study.  The broad range of outcomes includes but is not limited to: obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children from throughout the U.S., beginning with early pregnancy or even prior to conception  and following the child for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures until at least 21 years of age. Biological specimens and environmental samples will be collected throughout the Study. 

This procurement pertains to environmental samples. They are considered precious national resources such that their handling, security, analysis and storage must be subject to the most stringent requirements to preserve their identity, quality, and integrity. To the extent that these samples are stable, many will be stored in a repository for an indefinite period of time. However, some environmental samples will require prompt analysis because of either instability or research findings which suggest need for analysis, such as for a case control study.  

This procurement pertains to the environmental samples that require immediate analysis (generally within 14 to 30 days from sample collection).  These samples will be collected from households and perhaps other locations periodically throughout the NCS.  Environmental samples to be analyzed as part of this acquisition include particulate matter and gaseous air pollutants collected onto filters and passive samplers, dust wipes, and tap water. The classes of environmental analytes being considered for analysis in this acquisition include, but are not limited to: carbonyls, haloacetic acids, air oxidants, particulate matter, pyrethroids, and volatile organic compounds.  More detail about the design and methods for the NCS can be found in the Research Plan on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov 

The environmental laboratory(ies) shall perform the following tasks:  (1) receive, secure, analyze, and report on all NCS samples sent to them; (2) maintain samples and records in appropriate secure storage facilities that will retain their identity, integrity and quality (until results have been reported and accepted); (3) package and ship some residual environmental samples and processed samples for repository storage and subsequent additional analysis; (4) develop and maintain a quality assurance program for all laboratory operations including personnel management, and sample receipt, analysis, shipment and storage according to all Federal, State, and local regulations; (5) maintain an automated electronic tracking system to receive, inventory, process, and track samples, a system that is compatible with the NCS Information Management System; and (6) provide electronic data transfer in accord with EPA Staged Electronic Data Deliverable (SEDD), Draft Revision 5.1 format.

Offerors are required to perform all analyses at the laboratory facility(ies) described  in their proposal. It is preferable that the primary contractor perform as many analyses as possible, in as few locations as possible, for logistic and cost factors. However, given the large quantity of analyses, particularly in the later years of the contract, teaming or use of subcontractors is a possibility.  Redundancy within the organization will be viewed as a benefit to ensure capability to analyze the samples according to schedule.

To serve as an environmental analytical laboratory for the Study, interested offerors must have:
i.	Experience managing large environmental sample analysis projects.
ii.	 Experience in receiving, processing, analyzing, and storing, environmental samples such as air sampling filters and passive samplers, water, and household dust wipes,.
iii.	Laboratory accreditation by the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP), the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Laboratory Accreditation Program, or the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program for each proposed laboratory facility (specific physical location/address) for at least two years prior to the contract start date.
iv.	Laboratory facilities must be located within the 48 contiguous United States. 

The request for proposals (RFP) is anticipated to be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov, through the NICHD website:  http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/grantcontract/, and the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts website:  http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html   in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement. The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about 45 to 60 days after the issuance of the RFP.

SEDP is a 7 week summer environmental education and leadership development program. Students are  trained by a certified teacher, graduates and staff from EPA and partner agencies.   This versatile format is being used as a model for after school, day camps and summer programs. Hands on learning and extended learning experiences (field trips) enhance the learning process. Students are from all  racial, economic and cultural backgrounds and range in age from 12-14.  Philadelphia (14th year), Wilmington, Delaware* (8th year) and Washington, D.C. (6th year), Baltimore 2004 - 2006, and in Chester from 1999 - 2002.  Goals: The goal is to provide a holistic education for the students. SEDP  participants learn about environmental issues they face every day in their urban communities contaminated fish consumption, children's asthma, sun safety, lead, radon, pesticides, indoor pollution, radon, and hazardous waste in the household.  Other non environmental topics include: how to  communicate across cultural lines, to speak publicly, and to work well in a diverse work place. Some of the topics that the students learn are; life skill, job skills, critical thinking, self esteem, peer pressure, team work and personal and civic responsibility.  The major goal is for the  students, after graduation from the program, to take their knowledge back to their own communities to teach others -- especially elementary school kids -- about the environmental issues that affect their lives.

<DESC>Corporate Contract initiative for the set up of an Indefinite Quantity Type, Umbrella Contract for NSNs that are sole source to Northrop Grumman within a variety of Cage Codes.  This effort initially encompasses a total of 110 NSNS primarily consisting of NSNs within the FSC of 1560.  However, there are also items within the FSC of 1440, 1620, 1630, 1640, 1650, 1660, 1680, 3040, 3120, 4010, 4710, 4720, 5330, 5977, 6110, 6650, and 6685 within the initial population.  Terms will be FOB Origin with Inspection/Acceptanct at Origin.  There will be a three year base period, followed by the first option period of two years, the second option period of three years and a third option period of two years.  This equates to a total possible contract length of 10 years, if all option periods are exercised.  Deliveries will be stock (DLA Direct) only to depots within the Continental United States.  There is the potential that add ons can be added to the resulting contract in Phases.  Estimated solicitation issuance date is March 3, 2008.  The solicitation and all relevant attachments will be posted on DIBBS on the issue date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The ancillary equipment and spares include such items as unique spares kits, modification kits, external interface circuit cards, cables and spa re piece parts.  The proposed action will be a five-year, Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  Additionally, a one (1) year option will be included in the proposed contract which, if exercised will enable t he Government to issue Delivery Orders (DOs) for an additional year.  A total of approximately one hundred twenty (120) contract line items are anticipated for this new contract.  Sole source award to General Dynamics C4 Systems, (GDC4S), Taunton, MA is in tended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.

The NDIs to be acquired are either propr ietary to GDC4S or contain GDC4S proprietary equipment, proponents or firmware.  The Government does not possess the technical data for a competitive acquisition of this equipment.

Any delay in acquiring the required tactical switching equipment would negatively impact mission capabilities.  Additionally, the tactical switching equipment must  be fully interoperable with other existing tactical communications hardware and software. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  <BR>Delivery under the first Delivery Order shall be within 180 days after c ontract award.

<DESC>1.  Background Information<BR><BR>Aberdeen Test Centers Experimental Fabrication Division (EFD) uses a wide array of material to include steel, aluminum, and armor plate to support the various testing efforts and construct equipment, armor packages,  and fixtures.<BR><BR>At present, each job is estimated and a purchase request is made for the material required to complete that specific job.  Three different purchase requests are often created if there is a requirement for the three different materials  mentioned above.  This effort is repeated for every project that is completed by the EFD.<BR><BR>2.  Goal: The goal of this request is to find the most effective means to create three long term contracts (one for aluminum, steel, and armor plate) to be us ed as a mechanism to provide material for projects without submitting numerous purchase requests throughout the year to accomplish the mission.  Additionally, this request for information is to find methods to establish three separate long term contracts t o provide the ATC Experimental Fabrication Division with reasonable, price fluctuating material in a short time frame, with minimal effort from the buyer and seller.<BR><BR>3.  Challenge: The challenge of these contracts will be finding a method to determi ne the pricing of material at the time of request.  The pricing must be fair for both buyer and seller and this requires the ability of the pricing of material to fluctuate throughout the term of the contract based on the market value of the product.  The material must be delivered to the ESD and payment must received by the seller in a reasonable time frame.<BR><BR>4.

As previously stated, AIMS provides for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters for the CH-46E helicopter.  Therefore, the Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Contract  to Diagnostic Solutions for the Logistical, Technical and Data Management services in support of the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) in the CH-46E helicopter. However, companies possessing specific CH-46E AIMS experience may submit a capabilities statement to the Points of Contact listed on this synopsis. The capabilities statement shall specifically state how the company can meet the following requirements:  a minimum of two years experience with the AIMS system functionality; thorough understanding of the AIMS acquisition unit software; thorough understanding of the CDNU to AIMS interface software; thorough understanding of AIMS ground station/engineering software; thorough understanding of USMC aviation maintenance capabilities and current requirements relative to aircraft vibration analysis and main rotor blade track and balance and the part the AIMS will play in accomplishing these requirements; thorough understanding of how the T58-GE-16/16A engines are maintained, how the engines are set up for operation in the CH-46E, and how the engines are monitored for proper operation during use; an understanding of the part AIMS will play in accomplishing these actions, experience working in the USMC aircraft maintenance expeditionary environment, and an understanding of how the AIMS will be employed in an austere expeditionary environment and the ability to transfer to fleet operators, the AIMS system knowledge in a classroom and in a hands on environment. The initial contract for the design, test and manufacture of AIMS units for the CH-46E helicopter was awarded to Chadwick Helmuth, a business unit of Honeywell International, Inc. in June 2003.  The period of performance of the intended contract will include the base year, with two(2) one-year options.

Due to training and leave, at any given time crewmen may be vacating their rooms through the usual check out procedure (making those rooms available for other clientele, the Government WILL NOT be charged for these rooms) and checking back into others upon return. Because the vessel has not been fully commissioned (personnel are being hired and assigned at this time) the exact check-in dates are unknown.

The following individuals are allowed to speak in behest of the ship and agree to convey to the host timely information as ships personnel arrive and depart.

<DESC>Contract N00019-05-C-0051 was awarded 1 June 2005 to Diagnostics Solutions, Jacksonville, NC, for logistics, technical and data management services in support of the CH-46E helicopter Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS).  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, intends to award a firm fixed price modification to increase the level of effort on N00019-05-C-0051. The AIMS is an onboard system consisting of a constellation of sensors that measure engine performance and vibration levels on the aircraft, engines, and critical structure and components.   The amount of data gathered on the 154 aircraft that have the AIMS system installed is tremendous.  Additional effort is needed to gather, manipulate, and massage the data to find exceedances and develop normal operating ranges.   Diagnostic Solutions is the only company that has the requisite knowledge of the installed AIMS system to continue this effort without unacceptable delays and duplication of costs.  The period of performance for this effort will end 31 May 2008.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only. Note 22 applies.

NAVAIR has scheduled an Industry Day for 12 February 2008 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the Frank Knox Building, VIP Room, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Frank Knox Building is located just outside gate 2 with the entrance south of gate 2.  Access to the base is not required. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties. The intent of this Enterprise Architecture (EA) Center of Excellence (COE) Industry Day is to provide our Industry partners with an opportunity to learn more about the Navy?s focus on information delivery in a network-enabled environment and the direction NAVAIR is taking towards the development of architectural artifacts.   While careful and strategic planning goes into the design, an enterprise architecture actually emerges as a result of implementing individual projects; therefore, it is critical that NAVAIR programs develop their DoDAF views and ISPs using a defined set of recognized tools and templates.  This will ensure interoperability with other programs and demonstrate how these architectural artifacts decompose from overarching architectures.  The COE exemplifies the new collaborative business model ? multi-agency shared services delivery models.  Learn more about the EA COE vision and the perceived way forward in architecture development for NAVAIR.

The capability statement package shall be sent by mail to the following address:  Department of the Navy, Contracts Department, Code 251521, Building 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 21893 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463; or via email linda.p.nelson@navy.mil; or by facsimile to (301) 757-6516.  Submissions must be received at the office and cited no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EDT) on 28 February 2008.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed electronically to Linda Nelson at linda.p.nelson@navy.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted or returned.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice For Enhanced Polar System (EPS) Gateway Segment

Description:
This Sources Sought is for Market Research purposes only.  The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, is seeking to identify sources which possess both the capability and experience to support the design, integration and test of a primary EPS Gateway site in Alaska (TBD) and a secondary EPS Gateway site in CONUS (TBD).  The Enhanced Polar System (EPS) requirements are based on the requirements for Protected Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) in the North Polar Region.  EPS is the next generation SATCOM system that will replace the Interim Polar System (IPS).  The EPS program plans to have two EHF eXtended Data Rate (XDR) payloads in Molniya orbits and operational in the 2014/2016 timeframe.  

The EPS Gateway will provide the interface between Polar users and mid-latitude users via the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Global Information Grid (GIG) Point of Presence (PoP).  The major functions of the EPS Gateway will consist of: 1) two XDR based terminals with EPS upgrades for communication with the EPS payloads 2) automated transition of communications services from the descending payload to the ascending payload, 3) the gateway baseband equipment required to condition user traffic entering and leaving the gateway, 4) monitoring the gateway hardware status and health, and 5) an interface to the DISN GIG hardware.

The contractor will be responsible to design, develop, integrate and test the major functions of the EPS Gateway to include the following:
?	Perform a site survey and installation/checkout of a primary and secondary gateway sites.  
?	Conduct Developmental Test (DT) and End-to-End (E2E) tests with the user community in the 2011/2012 timeframe as the DISN core evolves.  
?	Have demonstrated experience with XDR communications, interfacing to the DISN, IP network services, and test.  
?	Responsible for all compliance requirements with regards to DoD IA practices, specifically DoDI 8500.2 series and  DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certification.  
?	Handle material up to DoD Secret and provide personnel with access to DoD Secret.  
?	Work closely with the EPS Government Systems Engineering Integration and Test (SEIT) team to orchestrate the successful development, deployment, and integration of the EPS gateway.  
  
An Industry Day is tentatively planned for second quarter Calendar year 2008 will be held to provide an overview of the EPS system, the gateway and the responsibilities of the Gateway Contractor.

Interested Gateway contractor candidates may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for the purpose of obtaining market research only.  No proposals are being requested nor accepted under this synopsis.      The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, will use information obtained under t his synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy to meet the combined needs of the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) and the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) Programs.<BR><BR> The intent of this synopsis is to access industrys (large and small business concerns (including 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) capability and interest in performing  medical construction projects using, job order contracting (JOC), design-build and design-bid-build processes to meet the needs of the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs.  Typical projects under the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs are anticipated to be primarily associate d with renovation of existing facilities, but may also include major repair and new construction.  Work may include, but is not limited to, replacement, restoration or modernization of hospitals, clinics, medical administration buildings, ambulatory health  facilities, medical warehouses, medical labs, biological engineering labs, dental clinics, veterinary clinics, wellness centers and any other buildings connected to/associated with air force and army health facilities Nationwide, including Alaska, Hawaii,  and all facilities on three medical installations and their annexes (Fort Sam Houston, TX;  Fort Detrick, MD;  and Walter Reed Medical Complexes, Washington, DC, Silver Springs, MD and Bathesda, MD).  Both programs may involve restoration and modernizatio n projects such as HVAC, medical gas, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, fire protection, interior renovation, terrorism/force protection, and exterior site and systems work such as utilities infrastructure, road ways, side walks, parking lots, landscaping, irrigation, and etc.  The combined AFMS and MEDCOM program need is anticipated to be $755 Million ($550 Million for Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) and $205 Million for JOC) over a five year period.<BR><BR>Task order values f or the MATOC may range from $300,000 to $50,000,000. Most of the task order values may likely be in the lower half of that range (i.e. $300,000 to $30,000,000), and a significant amount of task order values will likely range from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. <BR><BR>Task order values for the JOC may range from $3,000 to $5,000,000. Most of the task order values may likely be in the lower half of that range (i.e. $3,000 to $3,000,000), and a significant amount of task order values will likely range from $300,00 0 to $1,000,000.<BR><BR>More work is anticipated at locations with higher concentrations of facilities. Maps of major AFMS & MEDCOM medical facilities are located at the following links:<BR><BR>AFMS: https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/file/web/ctb_005389.htm <BR><BR>MEDCOM: http://www.armymedicine.army.mil/hc/medfacilities/medfacilities.htm<BR><BR>NOTE: Although the maps depict facilities worldwide, the geographical area of the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs under this synopsis is anticipated to be Nationwide, inclu ding Alaska, and Hawaii. <BR><BR>The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542; and a B usiness Size Standard of $31 Million.  It is anticipated that the program need for both AFMS and MEDCOM, may be met through the use of multiple and single award processes to establish various Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  The MATOC approach is anticipated to result in the establishment of qualified pools of contractors (each pool may have 3 to 6 firms) that compete fo r award of a task to perform the medical construction project.  JOCs by their very nature are Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOC). The total number of MATOCs and JOCs anticipated to be awarded, and the size and type of any set-aside solicitation will  be determined based on the responses received from this sources sought synopsis.  <BR><BR>The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among contractors for work to be performed under a multiple award approach.  <BR><BR>Interested Offerors sha ll respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis by completing the Market Research Questionnaire which may be accessed at<BR><BR>http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/MED/Surveys/Start.aspx<BR><BR>until 1600 (4 pm)  Central Standard Time on 20 February 2008.  Co mpleted questionnaires will be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy to support this program.  The Point of Contact for this action is Kenneth Carleton, Construction Contract Branch, Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers, at 817-886-10 84 or Kenneth.carleton@usace.army.mil.  <BR><BR>The market research survey seeks to identify industrys experience, past performance, and capabilities to execute this program.  Offerors responding to this Market Research Synopsis shall be limited to comple tion of the Market Research Survey form by 1600 (4 pm) CST on 21 February 2008.  <BR><BR>In addition, the Government intends to host a pre-solicitation conference (Industry Day) from 4 - 6 March 2008 in Fort Worth, TX.  The purpose of the Industry Day is  to provide an overview of the upcoming MATOC and MEDJOC Programs and to solicit interest and experience from the healthcare design and construction industry. The MATOC will be a Design-Build Contract and have a contract capacity of $500M. The MEDJOC will be a construction contract and will have contract capacity of $50M.  All work provided under these contracts will occur in the U.S (to include Alaska and Hawaii). At this time, it is the intent to award the MATOC to three or four qualified design-build fir ms and to two 8(a) design-build firms.  It is the intent of the MEDJOC to award one contract for work located in the eastern US and one for work located in the western US. <BR><BR>No proposals are being requested at this conference.  Interested parties are  invited to submit a request for a forty-minute period to meet with AFMS/MEDCOM representatives and make informal presentations outlining their capabilities related to health facilities planning, design, and construction. It should be emphasized that no pr ior government experience is required and that all potentially qualified parties are encouraged to attend. <BR><BR>Presentation time periods are structured to provide presenters twenty minutes for set-up and presentation, followed by a twenty-minute segmen t to go over the program and answer questions.  Ten-minute breaks are scheduled between each forty-minute presentation period.  The Government will provide a screen, projection device and computer for those wishing to use PowerPoint.  Interested parties ma y also participate via voice-only teleconferencing. <BR><BR>Information received will be used by the Government for the development of the Nationwide Medical MATOCs and MEDJOCs solicitation, currently scheduled to be released in April of 2008.  Participati on is strictly voluntary, at no cost to the Government, and will not provide participants greater access to any future contract awards.<BR><BR>The Industry Day will be held at the Army Corps of Engineers facility, at 819 Taylor Street (room 4C03), Fort Wor th, Texas.  <BR><BR>Presenters need to submit their request for a time period to Ms. Faybein Moy, Contract Specialist, 817.886.1059, not later than 1400 (2 pm) CST on 19 February 2008, via email to Faybein.Moy@usace.army.mil or fax 817.886. 6407.

<RESPDATE>022808
<CONTACT>Samuel Koelbl, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-875-6064, Fax 703-875-7370, Email KoelblSM@state.gov
<DESC>The Department of State (DOS), Bureau of African Affair?s Africa Peacekeeping Program (AFRICAP) program covers much of the security assistance work being requested throughout the continent of Africa.  The program enhances African countries ability to conduct peacekeeping operations and builds African capacities for crisis management and counter terrorism. One of the program?s key objectives is regional peace and stability. DOS uses its peacekeeping operations (PKO) funds to advance that goal by undertaking training of armed forces, enhancing their ability to deploy by land, air and sea. AFRICAP contractors also work with regional organizations to enhance their abilities to prevent, manage, and resolve conflict and supporting peacekeeping and peace building operations. 

  The Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs now seeks sources for the recompete of the AFRICAP program contract. The program encompasses logistics support, construction, military training and advising, maritime security capacity building, equipment procurement, operational deployment for peacekeeping troops, aerial surveillance and conference facilitation. Potential contractors must possess a broad range of functional regional expertise and logistics support capabilities. The intent is to have contractors on call to undertake a wide range of diverse projects, including setting up operational bases to support peacekeeping operations in hostile environments, military training and to providing a range of technical assistance and equipment for African militaries and peace support operations.  These tasks will be implemented in countries throughout the African continent, as designated by the DOS, and in conjunction with specific DOS programs and policies.  Potential contractors must possess the following capabilities: demonstrated capability for ?in house? construction work, experience working in a third world environment, stability operations support experience, military training, logistics support, equipment procurement institution building, strong financial management processes, proven adherence to timelines, strong HQ support for field, thorough  vetting of employees in the field, solid program management, and medical support.

    The current AFRICAP contracts were awarded to Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE) and DynCorp International in FY 2003.  Each contract has a ceiling of approximately $500,000,000.00.  It is anticipated that the total, combined ceiling amounts of all contracts awarded under this competition may exceed one billion dollars over a five year period.  Our anticipated acquisition strategy includes making multiple awards including 3 to large businesses and 1 to a service disabled, veteran owned or 8(a) firm.  It will likely be a mandatory requirement that all firms be capable of performing all potential tasks under the contract, however, partnering will be acceptable.  The Department of State anticipates the contracts to be IDIQ's of a hybrid nature with the ability to issue performance based work statements for individual tasks where possible. 

    An RFP is expected to be released within 60 days of this notice.  This sources sought notice does not bind the US Department of State to any agreement written or implied.  It is requested that interested contractors submit no more than one (1) binder containing narratives outlining their capabilities to perform the above outlined requirements. Additional binders, charts and booklets will not be accepted. All capabilities briefs shall be received by 4pm (EST) Feb 28th 2008. The delivery address is U.S. Department of State, Attn: Erica Gray-Beope 1701 N Ft Myer Drive, Room 500 Roslyn, VA 22209.  If you have any questions please email Erica Gray-Beope @ gray-beopeel@state.gov.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, ?Environmental Consulting Services.? SCOPE OF WORK:  The Loop Current (LC) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico enters as the Yucatan Current through the Yucatan Channel carrying about 30 Sv and extends northward to its maximum latitude close to 28&#730;N, where it turns eastward and exits through the Florida Straits.  The LC is the principal current and source of energy for the Gulf of Mexico and is the upstream portion of the Gulf Stream system.  The LC is well known to undergo northward extensions, followed by southward contractions that induce much of the upper-layer mesoscale variability of the eastern Gulf.  During these incursions, the LC sheds warm eddies or rings at an average interval of ~ 9 months.  The shedding of a LC ring has important repercussions on the entire water column of the Gulf?s circulation.  At depths shallower than ~800 m, LC rings dominate the mesoscale circulation and link the otherwise weakly connected basins of the Gulf, transporting mass, heat, momentum, and salt from the eastern to the western half.  The LC is hypothesized to be a source of bottom-trapped topographic Rossby waves that predominate in the deep Gulf circulation.  Some numerical models suggest that LC rings can also induce near-bottom eddy pairs that affect the circulation of the deep Gulf.  While its importance is well accepted, there have been no real dedicated studies of the LC.  The proposed study will be the first dedicated and systematic study of the Loop Current with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to start answering some important questions about the dynamics of this system. Because the LC crosses three international territories and because the dynamical aspects we need to understand also expand over these territories, the study will be divided into the American and Mexican territories.  This proposed study will concentrate its efforts on the American Sector, while Mexican oceanographers from CICESE, Ensenada will cover the Mexican territory.  Scientists from AOML will also work in coordination with this study.  All groups need to cooperate and collaborate to successfully complete the study and increase our understanding of this current.  The proposed study will consist of two main activities, the Field Work to be completed by the Field Team and the Numerical Modeling Work to be completed by the Modeling Team.  The overarching goal of this study is to increase our knowledge of the dynamics of the Loop Current (LC) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico through a combined analysis of observations and numerical modeling output.  Specific objectives are: 1- To increase our understanding of the causes of the LC incursions into the Gulf; 2- To describe oceanographic conditions leading to and during eddy shedding and reattachment and to cast light on the dynamics of these processes; 3- To understand how the LC interact and drives the lower layer circulation; 4- To provide statistics from in situ observations supplemented by numerical modeling output that describes the general circulation patterns inferred from remote sensing and geostrophic calculations; 5- To analyzed the available data and model output to test the several hypotheses; and 6- To provide information for MMS to fullfill its regulatory mission and comply with NEPA requirements.  The period of performance (POP) is anticipated to be sixty (60) months after award.  MMS envisions the POP broken into of six (6) months pre-deployment, thirty (30) months of data gathering, and twenty-four months (24) for analyses, synthesis and report preparation.  The POP will encompass all tasks from initial planning, through and including the MMS?s final acceptance of all deliverables.  The study area will consist of the region in the eastern Gulf of Mexico in USA waters north of the EEZ in the south, east of 89?W, and seaward of the 200 m isobath.  The study area may include the internationally disputed area known as the ?doughnut hole? which can be view in recent NOAA?s nautical charts of the Gulf of Mexico.  MMS encourages Offerors to limit planning the deployment of moorings to the northern sector of this problem area, these mooring locations will have to be cleared by MMS through the State Department to ensure that no conflict with international territorial claims arises.  Cost of this study is estimated to be between $5,000,000 and $5,500,000.  This study consist of eight (8) main tasks: (1) establishing a Science Review Group; (2) conducting a post award and mid-term meetings; (3) field work consisting of an array design, data collection (moorings deployments) over thirty (30) months and conducting processes studies in coordination with Modeling Team; (4) select, implement, and operate a numerical model to conduct process studies of the LC in coordination with the Field Team; (5) complete all data and model output analyses (6) gather and analyzed remote sensing and ancillary data to enhance the study?s data; (7) complete and prepare a synthesis report of all findings; and (8) set procedures to successfully cooperate and coordinate with interested groups.  HOW TO RESPOND: For a full copy of the Request for Proposal(RFP), please contact Mary Coleman via email at mary.coleman@mms.gov  Please include in your request the RFP Number M08PS00019 and title ?Dynamics of the Loop Current in U.S. Waters?, your organizations name, point of contact, Dunn & Bradstreet number, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address.

NAVAIR has scheduled an Industry Day for 12 February 2008 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the Frank Knox Building, VIP Room, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Frank Knox Building is located just outside gate 2 with the entrance south of gate 2.  Access to the base is not required. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties. The intent of this Enterprise Architecture (EA) Center of Excellence (COE) Industry Day is to provide our Industry partners with an opportunity to learn more about the Navy?s focus on information delivery in a network-enabled environment and the direction NAVAIR is taking towards the development of architectural artifacts.   While careful and strategic planning goes into the design, an enterprise architecture actually emerges as a result of implementing individual projects; therefore, it is critical that NAVAIR programs develop their DoDAF views and ISPs using a defined set of recognized tools and templates.  This will ensure interoperability with other programs and demonstrate how these architectural artifacts decompose from overarching architectures.  The COE exemplifies the new collaborative business model ? multi-agency shared services delivery models.  Learn more about the EA COE vision and the perceived way forward in architecture development for NAVAIR.

The capability statement package shall be sent by mail to the following address:  Department of the Navy, Contracts Department, Code 251521, Building 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 21893 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463; or via email linda.p.nelson@navy.mil; or by facsimile to (301) 757-6516.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for written information only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice and will not reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) is conducting market research to determine potential sources for technical services to the Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGL) Program. This work is currently being done through an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAG) with Department of Energy by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  This market research will help determine if this work can be done by domestic private industry as FFRDC's are not to be placed in direct competition  with domestic private industry. AEGL values are developed as a critical component to emergency planning and response needs in the event of an accidental or terrorist release of a chemical.  They are inhalation acute exposure values for detection, disability, and death for five exposure durations between 10 minutes and 8 hours.  The work will comprise preparation of AEGL Technical Support Documents (detailed documentation for the derivation of AEGL values); presentation to the National Advisory Committee for Acute Exposure Guideline Levels Committee (NAC/AEGL); presentation to the National Academies (NAS); response to comments from the public, NAC/AEGL Committee, and NAS; database development and analysis; and meeting support for the AEGL Program. Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW), and web-links to Standing Operating Procedures utilized by the AEGL Program, and three sample Technical Support Documents (see below). Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages are as follow: (1)  Documented experience in developing and revising inhalation comprehensive risk assessment documents on the level of complexity of the Technical Support Documents (TSDs) referenced below; (2) Sufficient numbers of high level scientific staff to perform the work specified in the Draft SOW.  The proposed scientific and technical authors shall be recognized nationally with demonstrated knowledge, expertise and experience in assessing inhalation toxicity experiments and creating a risk assessment profile on a chemical which integrates all toxicology information about the chemical and derives appropriate values to the task; (3) Sophisticated literature research and retrieval capability as specified in the AEGL SOP Section 2.3 referenced below "Guidelines and criteria for the search strategy, evaluation, selection, and documentation of key data and supporting data used for the derivation of AEGL values."; (4) Experience developing and documenting innovative human health risk assessment  methodologies/procedures or the refinement and improvement of existing ones; (5) Documented experience presenting complex chemical risk assessments to expert panels in an effective manner. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)" with a size standard of $6.5 million. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a request for interested potential offerors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they plan to meet the requirements in the draft Statement of Work (SOW). Submissions shall be limited to no more than ten (10) pages. Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the SOW will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice. Submitted capability statements should include the following: (1) Name of vendor; (2) Contact information (address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail); and (3) Technical description of capabilities in meeting the requirement. Businesses should submit an electronic copy of the requested information to the contracting officer, Robert M. Minjack, at minjack.robert@epa by 12 March 2008.  No feedback will be provided regarding individual capabilities statements. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged. --- Draft Statement of Work, Posted in Word and Adobe Acrobat PDF format  http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0811013/index.htm -- Standing Operating Procedures (AEGL SOP) http://www.epa.gov/oppt/aegl/pubs/sop.htm --- Technical Support Document for hydrogen chloride      http://www.epa.gov/oppt/aegl/pubs/tsd52.pdf  --- Technical Support Document for hydrogen cyanide http://www.epa.gov/oppt/aegl/pubs/tsd6.pdf --- Technical Support Document for aniline http://www.epa.gov/oppt/aegl/pubs/tsd5.pdf

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Research Electro-Optics Inc., Boulder, CO for the purchase four (4) cavity spacers.

The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for the manufacture of spherical optical cavity spacers with the stringent specifications required by NIST. This procurement will purchase specially-fabricated components for the development of the unique optical cavity that will be used to improve the performance of NIST's world-leading laser, which is used in the world's best atomic clock. NIST scientists have designed the unique optical cavity, but require specialized ultraprecision machining of some of the components, called spherical cavity spacers, that are crucial to ensuring the highest performance of the laser, and thus the performance of the atomic clock based on the laser. Delivery shall be on or before July 28, 2008. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide specially fabricated components that fully meet the Government?s requirements may submit a technical approach with supporting documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>16 -- 16; H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) Technologies
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-sm
<RESPDATE>030208
<CONTACT>Ronald Guy, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-5223, Fax 301-757-5284, Email Ronald.Guy@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies available to protect all H 53E helicopter engines and other flight-critical systems from small arms projectiles with the intention of procuring the material and services on a competitive basis.  

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  

It is a market research gathering tool used to determine potential business firms capable of providing these services prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  This should not be construed as a promise to contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN 

The H-53E-series helicopter is powered by three T64-series turboshaft engines.  The installed engines are covered by fiberglass cowlings hinged along the upper side.  The cowlings provide an aerodynamic fairing but no ballistic threat protection.  Damage to other flight-critical systems, such as main rotor and tail rotor flight controls and fuel and hydraulic lines, can force the aircraft out of its mission.  The helicopter is subject to hostile small arms fire and other threats when operating in combat areas.  A degree of personnel protection is provided by existing armored pilot seats and a ballistic protection system that covers the cockpit and passenger compartment floor areas, as well as the aircraft ramp.  The Navy is interested in solutions that would mitigate the threat of downing an aircraft due to damage to these vital aircraft systems from small arms and similar threats.  
 
DESIRED CAPABILITIES  
The Government desires a protective armor kit that could reduce the ballistic threat to critical systems on the H-53E helicopters.  The Government envisions a mission kit of armor panels or other protective means that could be installed as needed on any aircraft having mounting provisions.  The system would be easily removable at the organizational level for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low-threat/no-threat environment.  There is relevant engineering design experience with a steel plate armor system for the CH-53D helicopter; however, the government has not yet defined a specific set of components to be protected on the H-53E.  The intent of this RFI is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in lightweight armor products that could be applied to meet this requirement.
The government is interested in unclassified written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for protective systems with the capabilities described above.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide a total systems approach for commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified to meet the Navy?s needs.  Respondents should also describe their relevant experience with similar systems and the process they would envision for the development and qualification of a product to meet the stated need.  Please submit all questions to Ronald N. Guy, Jr., Code AIR-2.3.2.1, at email ronald.guy@navy.mil or alternatively at (301) 757-5223.     

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS
The Government envisions a solution for the H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) kits that meets the following operational and program requirements:
1.  Non-Developmental Item.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection should be a non-developmental item to the maximum extent possible.
2.  Qualification.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection must be qualified and demonstrate compliance to the helicopter?s environment.  This includes, but is not limited to compliance with MIL-STD-810F, Change 3 and/or DO-160E environmental conditions for helicopters.  Proof of qualification / compliance in robust dust / sand, fog / rain, snow / ice, exposure to contaminants, and salt environments should be addressed in the response.
3.  Mission Removable.  The H-53E CSA will consist of an A-Kit and B-Kit.  The goal is to have commonality between CH-53E and MH-53E systems. The A kit, also referred to as installation kit, shall consist of permanent or semi-permanent installations / modifications to the aircraft.  It is desirable to have the H-53E CSA installed with little or no permanent aircraft modifications.  It is recognized that a specific A-Kit may be required for each helicopter type/model/series.   The B-Kit, also referred to as the mission removable kit, shall consist of components / assemblies which may be installed or removed as mission requirements dictate.  It is desirable that the CSA Kit would be easily removable for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low threat / no threat environment.  The time to install / remove the B-Kit items will not impact mission availability for the aircraft.  The H-53E CSA must be practical to be retrofitted at a USMC organizational level facility, or by a field modification team / installed at the organizational level.
4.  Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.  The Government desires a system with minimal maintenance and inspection requirements at the organizational level.  The system should also be easily repairable for deployed units.      
5.  H-53E Performance Impact.  It is desired that installation of the H-53E CSA kit will result in limited degradation to existing range, performance / handling, and/or existing mission capabilities of either H-53E platforms. 
6.  Ballistic Protection Characteristics.  The H-53E CSA kit will provide adequate ballistic protection for its threat environment.  Interested parties should provide a summary of the proposed survivability capabilities within the H-53E CSA Kit proposal.  Threat magnitude capability (MIL-PRF-46103 standard or industry equivalent), repeatability and number of hits per a given area should be included as a minimum.  The contractor should address proven demonstration of this capability (through test and qualification data, etc) in their response. 
7.  Ballistic Protection / Coverage Areas and Weight.  The Government has not yet defined a specific set of components and/or areas to be protected on the H-53E platforms by the H-53E CSA Kit.  It is desired that the contractor define proposed coverage areas for the H-53E CSA kit in their response, and applicable weight for the CSA Kit based on their proposed coverage areas.   A desired CSA armor area density envisioned is 6.5 pounds per square feet or less. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT PACKAGE

Documentation should be in bullet format and must address, at a minimum, any prior/current corporate experience with the military performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, unclassified technical performance capabilities, organization/platform supported, and contract value.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Any resulting contract is anticipated to be a security classification level of Secret.  Any resulting contract shall be compliant with the specialty metals restriction of the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a and 2533b) in accordance with DFARS clauses 225.7002 and 252.225-7014 Alt. 1, inclusive of Class Deviations 2008-O0002 (which supersedes 2006-O004 and 2007-O011), unless an exception applies.  The services will be performed at the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.

<DESC>This document describes the services required by the USG for the development and fielding of a mobile EW Tactical Battalion (EW BN). The Battalion will be comprised of up to 4 mobile Company Electronic Warfare Operation Center (EWOC), 24 mobile Commu nications Electronic Surveillance (CES) Systems, 12 mobile & remoteable Communications Electronic Attack (CEA) Systems, 12 mobile Electronic Protection (EP) Systems, 1 high frequency (HF) command and control (C2) comms link from each company EWOC to an exi sting Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) in Jordan, and 1 very/ultra high frequency (V/UHF) comms network (aka Flashnet) for each company for intra-company passing of voice and data. There is the option of building an additional company EWOC to simulate the fi xed BN HQ component thus creating a tactical BN EWOC. There is also an option of replacing the C2 HF comms network with mobile satellite system such as a very small aperture satellite (VSAT) system. This RFI requests for P&A for the development and deliver y of one fully functional company and the P&A to develop and field three additional companies for a total of four. Specific services required by the US Army CERDEC from the contractor are as follows:<BR>a. The design, development, integration, testing, and  fielding of a fully functional EW company containing all requirements as described in paragraphs (A) through (I) below.  The delivered mobile EW company shall include all necessary major and support equipment and capabilities required to operate as an ind ependent unit including 1 EWOC, 6 CES systems, 3 CEA systems, 3 EP systems, 1 HF comms systems for communicating to BN HQ, and one (1) V/UHF intra-company comms network. With this delivered EW company, the developer shall also provide to the USG all the ne cessary documentation, drawing package, and required hardware and software including vehicles and shelters sufficient to integrate and produce 3 duplicate mobile companies in a USG facility. Additionally, the contractor shall deliver to the USG all the har dware and software to produce the fourth EWOC to replicate the BN HQ and a mobile satellite system to replace the HF C2 comms system in case Jordan exercises these options with the USG. The developer shall also provide on-call engineering support during th e USGs integration of the additional companies. With the delivered system, the contractor shall provide a report certifying the EW Companys proper operation and shall conduct a Contractor Factory Acceptance test (CFAT) at the contractors facility to dem onstrate the proper operation of the EW Company. The CFAT shall include all company elements including 1CO EWOC, 3 CES, 1 CEA, 1EP, an HF comms link and a V/UHF intra-company comms link. <BR>b. The contractor shall design all systems with little or no deve lopment using COTS hardware and software. The contractor may suggest multiple design configurations for the systems as long as the required performance requirements described below are met. Performance parameters shall not exceed those approved for sale fr om the USG to Jordan and those approved shall follow all required procedures and policies. The contractor shall minimize any development to the development of interfaces to allow all subsystems to operate as a unit EW BN. It is Jordans intent to fully fie ld a EW BN with four companies but how many companies get fielded will depend on the total cost. The contractor shall, therefore, design the first copy of the EW Company with the sufficient capacity, interfaces, and robustness to be able to integrate it in to and operate as a part of an EW BN unit comprised of a total of 4 companies. When designing interfaces, third-party software or interfaces are allowed but the contractor assumes responsibility for the proper function and warranty of the interfaces. The d esign shall incorporate the capability to expand the number of systems operating in the EW BN without modifications to the baseline systems. The contractor shal l also use commercial standards and protocols to allow future upgrades of the equipment within each subsystem. Where applicable, the design shall give preference to a decrease in development and using existing systems over the capability for future expansi on or upgrades.<BR>c. The contractor shall provide to the USG the CFAT test plans and procedures so the USG can duplicate this test on the additional 3 companies that will be developed in the USG facility. The contractor shall provide onsite engineering su pport to assist the USG in the conduct of a Government Factory Acceptance Test (GFAT) to be executed by the USG in the US for Jordanian representatives.  This GFAT would involve all the elements for an EW company but will be designed to represent a scaled- down version of an EW BN.<BR>d. On-call engineering and logistics consultation support during all government integration, systems testing, and systems fielding in the US and Jordan.<BR>e. The USG personnel shall participate and work side by side with the c ontractor personnel at the contractor facility in all phases of design and development of the CO EWOC, comms network, and CES, CEA and EP systems. The USG personnel attending shall be qualified engineers, technicians, and or military intelligence specialis ts.<BR>f. The USG shall conduct the GFAT in a government facility. If this test range is not available, the contractor shall include as an option in the proposal the cost of a providing a testing facility and range in the US. The range shall have the facil ities to conduct a multi-day test, allow for data collection, and data analysis.<BR>g. The contractor shall design, develop and execute a Field Acceptance Test (FIAT) in Jordan. This test shall be conducted using at a minimum 1CO EWOC, 3 CES, 1CEA, 1 EP an d a comms system. Depending on Jordanian requirements, the test may involve additional or all the EW BN systems fielded. The contractor shall provide any other support engineering and field representation support to help the USG complete the delivery of al l EW BN systems into Jordan.<BR>h. For each delivered system above, the contractor shall provide all required system, operator, and maintenance manuals for levels 1 and 2 maintenance. The training shall be conducted partially in the contractors facility a nd in Jordan. The contractor shall determine the appropriate duration and scope of the training to ensure the user can operate and maintain the EW BN systems after final delivery.<BR>i. The contractor shall deliver all systems to a USG facility as describe d below. Final transportation of all components of the system from the USG to Jordan will be done by Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).<BR>IV. EW Battalion:<BR>a. The EW BN shall consist of up to 4 EW companies.  Each company will operate independe ntly from each other and will communicate to BN HQ via the CO EWOC using a dedicated HF C2 network.

<SUBJECT>B -- Tribal Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention Program
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Announcement Only.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking sources for the following: 
Program Evaluation, Dissemination, and Translation CDC-Tribal Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention Program

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?s (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is currently funding four Native American tribes to design, implement, and evaluate effective injury prevention programs to reduce motor vehicle-related injuries and deaths among members of their communities. The four Tribes are completing their fourth year of implementing proven effective interventions selected from The Guide to Community Preventive Services, a systematic review of community-based interventions.  All four Tribes are performing satisfactorily and have process and impact evaluation results collected.  The four Tribes are:  1) the Tohono O?odham Nation in Sells, AZ; 2) the San Carlos Apache Tribe, near Globe, AZ; 3) the White Mountain Apache Tribe, Whiteriver, AZ; and 4) the Ho Chunk Nation, Blackriver Falls, WI.

The goals of NCIPC in this program are to: 1) determine if the effective strategies from the Community Guide can be successfully tailored to Tribal communities to reduce the high rates of motor vehicle (MV) injury and death; 2) determine the impact of these strategies in reducing MV injuries, reducing crashes, or increasing occupant restraint use among the four tribes; 3) determine the core elements, key characteristics, and collaborations needed for these strategies to be successful in Tribal communities; 4) determine the barriers that Tribes face in implementing these programs; and 5) learn how to move these effective strategies into widespread use with other Tribes. 

Diffusion is the process of moving an innovation or practice into widespread use.  The process includes dissemination, or spreading the word about a product, practice, or idea; implementation?that is adopting and using it; and promotion of its widespread use.  We stress the importance of dissemination, implementation, and widespread use because the best interventions have little chance of achieving a public health impact if they do not end up in practice. (Sogolow ED, Sleet DA, Saul J. Dissemination, Implementation, and Widespread Use of Injury Prevention Interventions in the Handbook of Injury and Violence Prevention, 2007).

The focus of this statement of work is to determine the extent to which the Goals as stated above were achieved and make recommendations for translation of the findings from these Tribal Injury Prevention programs. 

The vendor shall perform the following tasks:

A.	Develop and finalize report concept plan, measures, and questions with guidance from NCIPC Motor Vehicle Injury Prevention Team staff.
?	Participate in conference calls with Project Officer about status of project as needed.
?	Submit draft plans to NCIPC for review and approval.
B.	Summarize multi-year intervention and evaluation activities being conducted at the four Tribal Program sites (e.g., process measures, data collection plans, data entry and analysis activities, data reporting).
C.	Develop a ?translation plan? to document/summarize project findings that describe:  evaluation activities conducted during the project; core intervention program components; key characteristics contributing to program success; and factors contributing to program limitations/challenges/barriers. 
D.	Plan and develop project abstracts, presentations, and/or other project dissemination materials to be submitted for conferences and/or publications.  
E.	Plan and conduct with NCIPC staff an in-person two day evaluation workshop for Tribal staff and partners to conduct and summarize multi-year evaluation activities.  This will be conducted during an in-person meeting scheduled immediately prior to the 2008 Lifesaver?s conference in Portland, Oregon in April 2008.
F.	Provide technical assistance to the four Tribes to encourage sustainability/continuance of project activities following the end of CDC funding, particularly: data collection; strategic planning; and the prioritization of motor vehicle safety among the Tribe?s short- and/or long-term health concerns.
G.	Provide a report of findings for NCIPC staff to review and comment back to Vendor.
H.	Vendor shall consult with staff as necessary in performing the tasks covered by this contract.

No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the FEDBizOpps. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. 

RESPONSES DUE: Capabilities Statement: Interested firms should submit a capability statement to include the following: business classification size (e.g. HUBZone, ect.) and demonstrated expertise and qualifications in performing the work requirements stated above.

Specifically include in your statement documentation of your prior project experience as it relates to the study.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Data Storage
<DESC>The Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to award a sole source contract to First Federal Corporation, 75 West Watkins Mill Road, Gaithersburg, MD  22313-4021.  The USPTO has a continuing requirement for the pickup, storage and scheduled return of back-up magnetic media from the USPTO Data Center.  First Federal Corporation is currently the incumbent of this contract and is a woman-owned small business that provides off-site data storage services utilizing the most sophisticated facilities in the region.  First Federal offers and uses an automated bar-code controlled accounting system for USPTO back-up tapes that interfaces with USPTO bar-coded tape back-up systems.  Two major requirements of this service are that the contractor must be located outside a 25 mile radius from the Patent and Trademark Facilities, which is located in Old Town Alexandria and must comply with the ?Certification of Compliance of Vault With Specified Technical Requirements?.  
This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals; nor will a solicitation be issued.  This contract will consist of one (1) base year and two (2) option years.  
The USPTO has determined that in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c ) (1), ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.?  It is noted that the USPTO is exempt from the requirement to meet the test of ?full and open competition? as defined in FAR Part 6 but does endeavor to acquire products and services to the maximum extent possible in all acquisitions on a competitive basis.  An uninterrupted continuation of the critical data pick-up and storage support services currently being performed by First Federal Corporation is required to avoid seriously undermining and delaying the attainment of critical program objectives described in the USPTO?s Strategic Plan.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (BAA-08-SCIL) constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice be issued, requests for the same will be disregarded. INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch at Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting as the contracting agent for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), is issuing a BAA to solicit research proposals addressing innovative solutions for the initial phase of a new program dedicated to automating deep language understanding through the discovery of human-language indicators of social meaning. IARPA is the advanced research organization established by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in October 2007.  IARPA's principal mission is to impact fundamentally and positively the quality of the future operational processes of the Intelligence Community.  The SCIL Program is envisioned as a five-year effort that will be initiated at the beginning of the second half of FY08. Phase 1 of the Program will consist of a base period of 14-months with two possible option years. The final deliverable for the base period will be made at the 12-months mark. Work may continue in the following two months but, based on the work accomplished in the first 12 months, the Government will determine whether to exercise the first option year. Year 1 of the Program will focus on development of a proof-of-concept that automates techniques and resources that link linguistic features with social goals and extended meaning. Based on the results of the prior period, option years may be exercised to expand the work.  Proposals for an additional phase 2 of 2 years will be solicited under this BAA at the end of the third year. Proposers are invited to submit proposals for a base period of 14-months with two possible option years, indicating how the anticipated work of the base year would be extended and enhanced in the option year(s).  The Government anticipates funding approximately 6-10 proposals for the first year at varying levels of effort.  The base period is expected to fall within the $300,000 to $500,000 range.  This funding range is an approximation.  Cost proposals should reflect the realistic cost of the proposed work.  Option years will be in the same funding range. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for proposal preparation costs.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or to any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  If a subcontract with a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is proposed, offerors are reminded of the limitations on their participation (see FAR 35.017) and must provide documentation in the proposal that work is not otherwise available from the private sector.   Discussions with any of the points of contact or others associated with the Program shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to fund or award any proposed effort.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. This Broad Agency Announcement will remain open for 3 consecutive years from the date of the official announcement. The initial proposal submission will be 48 calendar days from the BAA announcement (March 22, 2008 NLT 3:00 p.m. (MST)).  Any subsequent proposals can be submitted at any time during the three-year open period of the BAA. Evaluation criteria will remain the same. Awards will only be made to those proposals deemed worthy and if funds are available. Tasks in all proposals should be clearly differentiated and optional periods as well as tasks should be labeled plainly. Information in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) that provides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria.  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.gov/acquisition/fort_h/solicit.html PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  The Socio-Cultural Content in Language (SCIL) Program intends to explore and develop innovative designs, algorithms, methods, techniques and technologies to extend language understanding into the socio-cultural arena.  The program will, in the end, develop automated resources that provide users with a broadened understanding of the contextual and social value of the information with which they work.  Advancing contextual understanding has become a priority throughout the Government.  The Science and Technology Office of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has recognized "globalization" and the leveling of the world and of communication as a primary focus of interest in order to improve understanding on the world stage. The Defense Science Board (DSB) has also identified the understanding of social and cultural contexts and norms as a priority for improving the quality of intelligence and providing relevant information to decision-makers.   Human language use reflects social and cultural norms, contexts and expectations.  Social variables (such as religion, status, gender, education) and contextual features (such as formality, participant beliefs, social situation) can influence the form and features of language.  Because language use responds to such social and cultural influences, then correlating social goals with language forms and content should provide a rich and expanded understanding of the attributes, roles and nature of the associations and intentions of the users of the language. Current human language technologies show little ability to "understand" or capture the social dimensions of language.  Today, information analysts gather facts, generally without the context in which these facts occur.  Yet, human language does more than serve as a means of transferring factual information.  Referential meaning (i.e., conveying information about the real world) is only one aspect of language use. Language can also convey feelings and other unstated meaning; elicit behaviors from others; and build and maintain relationships.  For the IC to be successful at characterizing a state-of-affairs for a decision-marker, the analyst must move beyond isolated pieces of information into an integrated picture of facts in their context of occurrence, including the cultural setting.  Understanding the global community of today requires access to the varying worldviews of the players on the world stage.  Many dimensions of these worldviews are reflected in language. The goal of the SCIL Program is to develop a methodology for identifying language indicators (i.e., their form, meaning and strength) of the social characteristics and objectives of members of a social group.  The relationship between language indicators and social objectives will be culture- and language-specific but the aim is to generalize across languages and cultures.  People tend to want to accomplish similar social goals; it is how they do this that differs.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES: The social sciences have developed theories of behavior that are relevant to this effort.  These theories and systems can serve as the framework for understanding social principles as well as for generalizing across cultures.  (As an example, Brown and Levinson in the 1980's proposed a theory of politeness that abstracted away from language forms and culture-specific strategies and provided a generalized view of politeness that (presumably) can apply across languages or cultures.)  The goal of the Program, then, is to develop a methodology for addressing similar social goals in different languages and cultures.  Although using one language as a baseline is permitted, proposers should keep in mind that the goal is to be able to apply insights on linguistic indicators of a social function to a new language and culture. The primary focus of the Program is on human language.  The aim is to associate linguistic cues and features with particular social goals and constructs of a social group (e.g., leadership, coercion, politeness).  Because much social research on social norms and rules exists, it is not the intent of the program to develop new social theories.  The research is focused on the automation of the association of linguistic features with social generalizations. Traditional approaches to social network analysis are not of interest, but social groups and the behaviors of their members, as conducted through or supported by language, are. Enhancement to information extraction technologies is also not of value to the Program, although such techniques can be used if it is demonstrated that the correlation between social goals and linguistic cues can be met. TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH AREAS:  Unit of Analysis:  Social Groups The unit of analysis for this Program will be social groups.  It is not necessary that the groups be named groups (e.g., Al Qaeda, FARC, Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood).  The groups can be of any size (i.e., two to n participants) but the members must interact in some way (i.e., there must be at least a source and an audience).  The group can be an established one (named or unnamed), an emergent one or one that is dissolving.  The goal is to identify and represent indicators of social functions and relationships as they are manifested in the language used. Medium of Analysis:  Human Language Language is a mirror of socio-cultural norms.  As such, we should be able to explore how social functions (e.g., leadership, politeness, gender bias) are realized in human language. In the first year, English may be used to develop a baseline but the goal of the Program is to develop a methodology for characterizing social phenomena across languages, generalizing their function and correlating them with linguistic markers.  Preference will be given to those proposers that extend their work, or show how they would go about extending their work, to other cultures and languages, drawing contrasts and similarities across languages. Multidisciplinary Human beings tend to require fulfillment of similar social goals.  The strategies used to accomplish these goals and the influences on how they are accomplished, however, can differ dramatically across cultures and social groups.  The social sciences (e.g., sociolinguistics, social and linguistic anthropology, sociology, cognitive psychology, among many) have examined many of these strategies and generalized to underlying principles - where possible, developing theories of social and cultural structures and functions. It is not the intent of this Program to duplicate or recreate this research and these theories.  The expectation is that proposers will reference relevant theories, contributing linguistic evidence in support of the theories or recommending revision or enhancement of the theories based on linguistic evidence, as appropriate.  Preference will be given to those proposers that make clear what social theories they intend to use and to those teams that include experts in the relevant social sciences. Topics There are three dimensions to this effort:  the social features and activities of the group and its members; the linguistic features that serve as evidence of social goals; and the social science theories that help to define the social features.  It is the correlation of these three dimensions that is important to the Program, showing how language serves as evidence of social functions. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  See the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides preparation and submission instructions for proposals.  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.gov/acquisition/fort_h/solicit.html PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Proposals are due on or before 3:00 PM, Mountain Standard Time, 22 March 2008 to the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch, Post Office Box 12924, ATTN: BAA (I.

<SUBJECT>--Class C Mountain Boots
<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, in support of Product Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation for Mountaineering Boots. The goal of this effort is to identif y firms with capabilities to provide/design/develop boots for use by the combat soldier in rugged mountainous terrains and conditions. Interest is in a readily available product or information on development that will be available within the next six to tw elve months. This will be based on a concise and attainable development/commercialization plan. The Mountaineering Boots must be capable of meeting critical technical and uniform requirements as follows: 1) Class C, durable mountaineering boot that reduces  shock impact while enhancing stability and support to the ankle.  Class C boots, though stiffer and slightly heavier then traditional hiking boots, are specially constructed to support movement over more rugged terrain. 2) Provides protection during wet c onditions but able to breathe and minimize foot perspiration. 3) Outsoles that provide propulsion and torsional support. 4) Able to keep trail debris out of boot while maneuvering. 5) Designed to reduce pressure points and discomfort during descents. 6) Pr events blistering during extended use. 7) Neutral color [such as brown or tan]. 7) Provide for quick break-in. 8) Stiff-soled with tread that grips rocky terrain and loose, however flexible enough to remain comfortable for long periods of activity. Interes ted sources must, within seven (7) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their current product(s) and how they are made or could be modified to address the U.S. Army requirement. Interested sources shall include detai led information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production cability. Product information should include product cost, technical information (e.g. technical literature, data and illustrations, technical certifications),  performance capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and relevant company background/experience, and product sample if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample. Firms should provi de pricing for currently available product and/or estimated pricing for footwear currently under development. Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business. This notice is for market research only. Responses to this notice are to  be sent to Mr. Michael Holthe, U.S. Army Natick Soldier RDEC, AMSRD-NSC-WP-WC, Bldg #4 Room D323, Natick, MA 01760-5019. This is not a request for quotations.

The  tape cartridges are unique in design and recording surface density and are  used exclusively in an AMPEX DST-314a tape drive system.  The quality of  the material used and the precision standards to which these tape  cartridges are manufactured ensures product durability and operational  reliability during use and prolonged periods of archived storage.  Consumed at a rate of three tape cartridges per day, NASIC?s DEI division  must maintain a sufficient inventory of cartridges to meet daily backup  requirements of sensitive imagery analysis data.  If the level of  available tape cartridges falls below an estimated minimum, then mission  failure may occur.  Currently, there are no other tape cartridges that  meet NASIC?s needs. Primary Place of Performance: Wright-Patterson AFB, OH Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services)  required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible  source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency  requirements.

<DESC>This synopsis/solicitation is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only notice; a paper solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number 08-Q-LDQ001162 shall be referenced on any technical quote and price quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23, Effective 25 January 2008. All future information about this acquisition including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This is a Brand Name only sole source requirement. Items requested must be manufactured by Draeger since only their items will work with the Draeger pump in the Draeger Hazmat Kit. Based on market research conducted with knowledgeable individuals in the related industry interchanging brands of pumps and tubes may produce a significant reduction in accuracy which is unacceptable to the FBI when using monitoring and detection equipment.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Interested vendors should contact Cheryl Sivertsen with any questions regarding this notice.  Contact information is located below.


SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT:   OCC News Brief and Clip Package

PURPOSE:  Create and provide daily news briefing and clip package to support the Comptroller of the Currency and other OCC senior staff.

BACKGROUND:  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to award a contract for  the daily creation of a morning news briefing and clip packet for the Comptroller and senior staff.  In furtherance of the OCC?s role of supervising the nation?s banks, officials and staff members must start each day fully informed about important news on national banking news printed and broadcast nationwide.  The Comptroller has determined this will best be accomplished via an expert-edited briefing supplemented with full-text articles. 

This procurement is a 100% small-business set-aside with a firm-fixed contract, with one base period and four additional one-year options.

GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY AND INFORMATION:  The OCC will provide the following:
OCC Public Affairs staff will provide technical direction and be available to provide guidance and clarification.
OCC Public Affairs staff will provide a list of news sources that should be reviewed daily.  This list is provided as a minimum.  The contractor may review additional sources based on its expertise.
OCC will review and approve an initial outline for the news briefings and provide feedback on the quality of the news briefings to improve its relevance, coverage, and accuracy.

CONTRACTOR FURNISHED ITEMS:  The Contractor will provide the following:
Prepare and distribute a daily briefing memo highlighting and summarizing important elements of news stories printed and broadcast nationwide. Items included will be culled from thousands of outlets daily and will be those OCC officials themselves would have identified as important. Redundant and irrelevant news will be eliminated.  1.  The vendor must use human analyst/editors to: find and review articles and broadcasts from all major (and most smaller) daily newspapers, national and local television, newsweeklies, magazines and journals, Internet sites and specialty press.  It then must apply a sophisticated understanding of OCC?s mission to determine which aspects of each story are important to the various constituencies within OCC; edit out all information (not stories, but parts of stories) that is redundant or irrelevant; and weave together the remaining (important) information such that it reads like a single story rather than what it really is, subsets of myriad stories on the same topic. In creating this new story from elements of various original stories, the vendor should also, as appropriate, characterize the coverage such that OCC officials can quickly get a sense for how widely various story elements were run and also for the general tonality of the coverage.  2.  Summaries should include source, date, page, circulation and author where available.
The briefing must also: be delivered weekdays by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time except on Federal holidays (including no more than two days at each of Thanksgiving and Christmas); include news from weekends and Federal holidays in the briefing immediately following those days; include a table of contents organized by subject matter; be available via an IP-protected Web site (including a searchable archive) or other secure delivery as dictated to vendor by OCC; include daily email notification when the briefing is available; be printable in MS Word and Adobe PDF formats; include the full-text backup document with complete versions of the stories referenced in the briefing, including its own table of contents and story sequence matching that of the briefing; include a section showing the story headlines from the nation?s major daily newspapers and story lineup from the previous evening?s national news broadcasts; include a Washington Schedule section for the important events scheduled that day; be available to any and all employees of OCC, exclusively for OCC?s internal use.
Vendor must review USA Today, the Washington Post, the Financial Times, the New York Times, American Banker, BNAs Banking Report, and the Wall Street Journal in hardcopy on deadline to identify stories not available electronically or news of interest to OCC. Cost of subscriptions should be reflected in the price as required.  Television coverage must be those stories broadcast nationally and locally; it is not sufficient to provide links to stories appearing on the websites of local broadcasters, as many of those stories never aired.
In addition to news specific to OCC and its mission, the vendor must provide a national news section in the briefing suitable to the needs of OCC officials who must be aware of important developments affecting the federal government broadly so they may interact with peers in the Administration and Congress.
For print articles referenced in the briefing, the vendor must provide a link to the original full-text versions when available on the original publishers? websites.  When links point to content on subscription-based sites, the Comptroller may at its discretion subscribe.  Under fair use, the government also requires a backup document with the full text of every story referenced in the briefing.  For broadcast stories in which reviewing the actual audio/video would be particularly useful, the vendor will provide a link to available ?video clips? that stream to the reader?s desktop.
The briefing must be delivered weekdays by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time except on Federal holidays (including no more than two days at each of Thanksgiving and Christmas); include news from weekends and Federal holidays in the briefing immediately following those days; include a table of contents organized by subject matter; be available via an IP-protected Web site (including a searchable archive) or other secure delivery as dictated to vendor by OCC; include daily email notification when the briefing is available; be printable in MS Word and Adobe PDF formats; include the full-text backup document with complete versions of the stories referenced in the briefing, including its own table of contents and story sequence matching that of the briefing; include a section showing the story headlines from the nation?s major daily newspapers and story lineup from the previous evening?s national news broadcasts; include a Washington Schedule section for the important events scheduled that day; be available to any and all employees of OCC, exclusively for OCC?s internal use.
The news included in the briefing must be current, meaning the 9:00 a.m. briefing will include stories appearing that morning in the nation?s newspapers and broadcast in the preceding 24 hours by the nation?s national and local television news outlets. It is very important that there be an extremely low incidence of missed or day-old stories.
Produce and distribute one-page early bird summary of top news by 6:00 a.m. highlighting news seen by other government Department executives with a focus on major banking and financial news.
The vendor must also be flexible to accommodate changes to the briefing based on changing needs at OCC.  The memo is anticipated to average seven to ten pages per day, with the full-text clips package being much longer.  If the OCC later determines it prefers a much more concise briefing or one that contains more information, the vendor would be expected to accommodate changes of this nature within the terms of the existing contract, provided those changes don?t materially alter the vendors costs. Similarly, the vendor might be required on short notice to change the topics covered; the deadlines; the format of the briefing; etc.  Vendor will coordinate the order and outline of the Daily Digest and Early Bird products in advance.  Relevant stories from Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Financial Times, and American Banker will be group at the front of the Daily Digest product under Leading News.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) Headquarters, has a requirement to establish and operate an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) as authorized under Title 5, United States Code (USC), Section 7901; Title 5, USC, Section 7904; Executive Order (EO) 12564, Drug-Free Federal Workplace, and Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 792, Subpart A.  The EAP will provide services to approximately 400 MMS employees and, where feasible, eligible family members.  The employees are located at the Parkway Atrium Building (Atrium), 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia, 20170, and at the Main Interior Building, 1849 C Street N.W., Washington, D.C.  20240.  The purpose of the EAP is to provide short-term, problem-focused counseling services with limited follow-up and monitoring; comprehensive referral services; employee and supervisory training; crisis intervention; and outreach.  An EAP is an essential element in achieving a drug-free workplace.  The MMS embraces the concept that, by providing services to help empower employees to resolve personal problems, particularly those of alcoholism and drug abuse, productivity and morale can be enhanced.  Specifically, the contractor will:  (A) Provide licensed, certified counselors (individuals with a minimum of a Masters Degree and three years of counseling experience) for all counseling services under this contract.  Counseling services should include (1) problem identification and assessment; (2) short-term consultation and intervention (up to six sessions); (3) referral, as appropriate for treatment or rehabilitation, to a community-provided service or professional resource (such referrals are to be made with consideration to cost, insurance coverage, specific needs, and location); and (4) follow-up to aid an employee in achieving an effective readjustment to his or her job during and after treatment.  Services can be extended to covered family members (covered family members are defined as spouse and dependent children (younger than 18, unless incapable of self-care) when there is a nexus between the problem of the family member and that of the employee.  Cases that involve management referrals or, in the professional opinion of the counselor, require the attention of management, shall be coordinated with the appropriate staff member of the Human Resources Division, which is responsible for the implementation and utilization of the EAP.  Where appropriate and allowed by the confidentiality requirements, the counselor shall also apprise the referring management official of the employee?s progress in treatment.  (B) Provide referral services to employees who require long-term, on-going counseling, treatment facilities, or special services not covered by this contract.  Referral services to other providers or treatment facilities should not be made without first notifying the employee that the cost of continued counseling must be covered by health benefits coverage or direct payment by the employee.  (C) Provide (as needed) counselors trained in Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) methods to provide support to employees who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, the emotional stress of which is affecting productivity.  The need for these services may be on an individual or group session basis.  (D) Provide consultation services to supervisors, managers, and human resource personnel on matters affecting employees such as:  constructively handling conflict, identifying substance abuse problems, coping with change in the workplace, dealing with violence in the workplace issues, etc.  (E) Provide a supply of appropriate literature (posters, pamphlets, wallet cards, handouts, etc.) to publicize the program.  The agency will distribute the literature at no cost to the contractor.  The contractor will submit drafts of literature for review by the agency within 30 days of receipt of award of contract.  The agency will return any comments within 15 days of receipt of the draft copies.  The contractor will incorporate these comments into the draft copies and provide final publicizing material for distribution to employees within 15 days of receipt of agency review comments.  (F) The MMS will provide a room at the Headquarters Atrium building in Herndon, VA, one day weekly where a counselor must be available to meet with employees.  If the employee desires one-on-one counseling in a location other than the Atrium building, the contractor will provide adequate office space for employees and counselors to meet.  The office space must be within a reasonable commuting distance from the employee?s office.  In addition, the contractor must provide an easy-access, toll-free telephone system.  Telephone services must be available to all program users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  The contractor will provide emergency assistance/counseling, as appropriate, within 24 hours of being contacted.  Appointments/contact for non-emergency matters will be scheduled within 5 days of initial contact by the employee or supervisor.  A counseling session is generally 1 hour in duration.  (G) Provide an orientation program explaining the range of services offered by the EAP, instruction on accessing the program and an explanation of privacy and confidentiality standards at the beginning of the base year of the contract and during each subsequent option year.  Video presentations may be substituted for in-person presentations.  The contractor will submit a draft of the orientation program for review by the agency within 30 days of receipt of award of contract.  The agency will return any comments within 15 days of receipt of the draft.  The contractor will incorporate these comments into the draft and provide a final product for review within 15 days of receipt of agency review comments.  (H) Provide formal (presentation) and informal (one-on-one) training to supervisors, managers, human resources personnel, and others deemed appropriate by management.  This training should include items such as providing information on procedures and techniques for referring employees to the EAP; crisis management; appropriate documentation; privacy and confidentiality issues; techniques to integrate employees back into the workforce; and information on the range of services offered by the EAP.  (I) Conduct educational sessions/presentations covering current mental health issues designed to assist in self-identification and give visibility to the EAP (as needed, but no more than five times per year).  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for providing ongoing alcohol and drug abuse education at each location.  As needed, the agency may request face-to-face educational seminars, in addition to the five mentioned above, that specifically deal with drug and alcohol abuse.  Upon agency request, the contractor will submit a draft of the sessions for review prior to presentation.  Any agency comments will be incorporated into the draft.  (J) Provide statistical reports to the agency on a quarterly and annual basis which track program utilization, to include number of referrals, source of referrals, primary problem(s), referral action, and client status (active, inactive, terminated).  The contractor will conduct regular progress evaluations concerning the effectiveness of their referral resources and the employee?s recovery.  Sufficient data will be maintained by the contractor to determine and verify costs, number of participants, types of utilization, and the frequency of occurrence.  All reports will be provided to the Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR).  The contractor is expected to maintain strict confidentiality and record-keeping that complies with all applicable Federal regulations and statutes regarding privacy of personal information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space, and Hotel Services located in San Antonio, TX.  San Antonio was selected as the location for this particular meeting for several reasons.  It is centrally located in the US which is important considering attendees will come from all over the country.  Because of the timeframe still being winter, a Southern city will help reduce the risk of travel hazards and stranded travelers.  In addition, San Antonio is a city that is easily accessible from almost any city and has a very reasonable per diem rate ($112 vs. $201 in Washington, DC).  Conferencing costs are much lower, too ($400/day for a conference room vs. an average of $750 in the Washington, DC area).  Request for Proposal V776-08-345 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.  This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offerorýýýs services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurances(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.  (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)  This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-22, Effective November 23, 2007, and VAAR 97-10.  NAICS Code 721110, 721120 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  This announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued.  The Period of Performance for this requirement is March 3-7, 2008. Actual conference days are Tuesday, March 4th, thru Thursday, March 6th.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, OI&T Operations Communications Council is holding a meeting to allow a face-to-face exchange which will provide for smoother, quicker and more effective resolutions and decisions for all areas of concern.  The hotel(s) must accommodate a total of 200 sleeping rooms (approximately 50 per night, based on the timeframe), must provide all requirements specified for conference needs in Parts A, B, C, and D below, and must provide lodging rates within the stated Government Per Diem for San Antonio, TX.  A separate written solicitation document will not be issued.  A response to requirements listed below shall be submitted on letterhead and must address all requirements listed in a separate technical proposal.  A hotel contract shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal.  The hotel facility must be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm.  In accordance with FAR 52.204.7 ýýý Central Contractor Registration (Oct. 2003); contractors are Required To Register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http;//www.ccr.gov, PRIOR to award of any contract.  The hotel facility must be compliant with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-366) (42U.S. C. 12101 et. Seq.).  The hotel facility must accommodate an estimated 50 attendees with the following needs:  Part A:  Hotel Lodging ýýý 50 sleeping rooms for VA attendees to begin check-in on Monday with the majority of attendees to check out on Friday after conference.  Rooms must be individual/private-sleeping rooms with toilet facilities at Government prevailing per diem rate.  Payment for Part A shall be the sole responsibility of each attendee, to include any incidentals and no-show fees.  Part B:  Meeting space-Hotel should be able to provide conferencing space for 3 days for approximately 50 attendees, to include some modest food and beverage.  Audiovisuals will be limited, with the group intending to bring its own projector and conference phone.  Group will likely choose to rent a screen, flip chart, phone line, and microphone.  Part C:  The Federal Government Policy does not permit a guaranteed amount of food and beverage revenue. Part D:  Other requirements/special considerations: complimentary meeting space, variety of restaurants at property or within walking distance of the property (not to exceed 4 normal city blocks).  Award will be made to the offeror determined to be the Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 evaluation factors.  Evaluation may be made with or without discussions with the offeror(s).  Prices will be evaluated in terms of cost for accommodations and services, cancellation and attrition, food and beverage/refreshments.  All responsible sources that can meet the requirements and provide items as listed above may respond to this solicitation by submitting hotel contract and descriptive literature.  (This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)  The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference.  This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

The contractor will be allowed 18 months to complete the project.  -The wildlife ramps are made of expanded metal, similar to grate material. -The "water holes" are all stock tanks ranging in various sizes and styles. -All stock tanks are located on BLM land.  However, the contractor, in most instances, will have to access the stock tanks on BLM, via private land. -Rebar is pounded into the ground next to the stock tanks and the wildlife ramps are slipped over the rebar, slid down to the tank and installation is complete.  Except on rubber tire tanks, lugbolts will need to be used.  (Not sure how many tire tanks there are.) -Each tank has a two track going directly to it or there is easy access to it, if no two track.

Answer: One simultaneous user is one type of institutional license and a site license is a different type.   Different licenses are offered by different companies.   When a company uses a concurrent or simultaneous user model, we want one concurrent user.   Most publishers use the site license model, based on user population. We know that the same company will not offer both licensing models, this was meant to be an either/or 
option.

Questions
1. Will these subscriptions be new or are they renewals?
Answer: They are renewals

2. If they are renewals, do you know whose name they are currently subscribed? 
Answer: Under USUHS LRC

3. Online journals need an e-mail address to complete. Do you know whose e-mail applies to each journal?
Answer:  gjacobs@lrcm.usuhs.mil or gretchen.jacobs.civ@lrcm.usuhs.mil (Please do not contact end-user)

4. In the information section of the bid, the information leads me to believe some of the online accesses may be university wide. There is a significant cost difference in a
single online access and a multi-user access. Do you know if this is applicable?
Answer: Yes, university wide is what we want

5. How do I submit the information?
Answer: Please look within the solicitation all that information is included. You can submit it via email by the close time or by mail, but it has to be post dated by close of the response date which is February 8, 2008.
