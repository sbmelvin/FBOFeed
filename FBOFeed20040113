<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 04-11 Control Plane; CLOSING DATE: 12 January 2005;  FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  09 March 2004;   POC: COL Tim Gibson, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA04-11@darpa.mil;  Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/ControlPlane/index.htm
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for an Internet Control Plane protocol (hereafter called the Control Plane Program). The purpose of the Control Plane Program is improving end-to-end Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) wide-area network performance between the Continental United States (CONUS) operating base and forward deployed tactical units.  The technology the program seeks to develop is the ability of individual hosts (end-points) to learn essential characteristics about the network path between themselves and their transmission partners.  This allows the hosts to "shape" the traffic they generate so it can pass through the network with the minimum amount of additional network load (e.g., minimizing retransmissions, reducing fragmentation) possible.  To shape their traffic correctly dynamically the hosts must become aware of the wide-area network's state.  Additionally, when multiple network paths are available, a host should be able to choose the path that best meets its requirements and simultaneously transmit over multiple paths.  Finally, DARPA/ATO is soliciting proposals under this BAA to perform vulnerability testing (e.g., Red Teaming) and performance testing of the technical Control Plane solutions.
PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE:  A Proposers Day Conference will be held on 4 February, 2004 at the Executive Conference Center, One Virginia Square, Arlington, VA beginning at 8:30 am and ending late in the afternoon.  The purpose of this Conference is to promote additional discussion on this topic, encourage teaming, and answer questions potential proposers may have about Control Plane.  Please contact Marisa Riehn (Marisa_Riehn@sra.com) not later than 30 January 2004 if you plan to attend.  Please declare your citizenship in the e-mail.  Foreign nationals should complete and return a DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) not later than  30 January 2004 if they wish to attend the conference.  The DARPA Form 60 will be sent to you based on declaration of citizenship.  The Proposers Day is voluntary: attendance is not required to propose to this BAA.  The overview briefing and Questions & Answers will be available through the Control Plane website:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/Control Plane/index.htm.  
Additionally, attendees who would like to share information at the conference may submit a request to make a fifteen minute presentation to discuss your capabilities and innovations related to this topic.  Please contact Marisa Riehn of SRA Inc., Adroit C4ISR Center (Marisa_Riehn@sra.com, to provide an overview of the material you wish to present.  All material to be displayed at the conference must be screened in advance by the Program Manager for sensitive, but unclassified material.  Additionally, all material must be approved for release to the public by the funding organization (government, corporate, etc.) prior to presentation.  The Control Plane Conference will be open to the public.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated on their general merit, compliance with program requirements, and other factors listed below.  In order of importance, the proposal Evaluation Criteria includes: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Operational Utility; (c) Concept of Operations; (d) Management Approach; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission; and (f) Cost Realism, including implementation costs.  Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award using other than full and open competition, not a request for proposals.

This effort includes tasks related to NEPA compliance, NEPA policy actions, response to comments on NEPA documents, preparation of NEPA documents, and preparation and assistance in conducting public meetings/hearings required under NEPA. Lechel, Inc will assist DOE ORD in technical, regulatory, policy and programmatic coordination and integration of NEPA documents with the License Application (LA) and associated support documents.  They will also provide responses to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) comments on the LA, and in any LA to receive and possess spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW). In addition, Lechel, Inc will assist in the internal DOE LA review process by supporting DOE in the development of a review process similar to the one DOE uses to review major NEPA documents.  The proposed contract will be a labor-hour, level of effort contract for a maximum of five years, which includes a two year base period and three one-year option periods. This proposed action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25s leading edge slats.  Over the years the slats have been cannibalized and repaired several times.  Repaired slats do not meet the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) critical profile and contour dimensions for fit to aircraft which contributes to excessive labor hours during installation.  History shows that a complete disassembly of HU-25 slats is necessary for thorough inspections, which commonly require outer skin replacement.  Slats are serial number tracked under the Coast Guards Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  In order to maintain better configuration control, the Coast Guard has assigned and labeled slats with unique Coast Guard part numbers reflecting complete slat assemblies (see ARSC Control Drawing 925-267).
2.0	OBJECTIVE

A.	The Coast Guards objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 slat assemblies.  Repaired/overhauled slats must meet the OEMs critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal trimming and adjustment during slat installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair/overhaul. 
	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for leading edge slats.  First, a baseline repair would be required for slats that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage. This would require skin replacement and hardware.  Second, overhauls would be required for slats that also exhibit significant wear and/or internal corrosion.  The offeror shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline skin replacement.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror's technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, non-serviceable slat storage, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul slats.
	The offerors responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Centers (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  
B.	To meet the Coast Guards objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 
1.	Technical
a.	Provide detailed work specifications for slat baseline repair and overhaul
b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan
c.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard
d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEMs critical profile and contour dimensions per the OEM drawings listed in paragraph 3.0.
e.	Provide separate price breakdowns for slat baseline repair and overhaul
	Note: The Coast Guard considers a baseline repair as replacement of slat skins and required hardware to make complete slat assemblies.  An overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes replacement of internal assemblies and costly cannibalized components (i.e. bearing and rail supports, internal structures, rails, movable rib assemblies, etc.)
2.	Past Performance  
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items
b.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractors actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractors cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractors proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractors technical proposal.

This is a market survey to locate a source for production, testing and delivery of MELIOS spares; the Electronic, Optics and Laser Modules. NSNs 5860-01-324-2790, 5860-01-324-2791 and 5860-01-324-8206 respectively. MELIOS:-(Description for information only ); The Mini Eyesafe Laser Infrared Observation Set is a lightweight, individually operated, hand-held or tripod-mounted laser rangefinder capable of  determining ranges from 50 through 9995 meters in 5 meters increments and displaying the range in the eyepiece. Optics Module:-The Optics Module shall determine and display in the eyepiece the distance to a target with required minimum of 50 meters and maximum of 9995 meters,in 5 meters increments, by using the laser start pulse and the reflected laser stop pulse. The optics Module shall exhibit no more than 1 failure out of any 100 consecutive rangings thereby determining the range to targets  under the conditions that the emitter beam shall be parallel to the Optics Module Assembly optical axis,the emitter shall output 2 pulses, one for the start time, one for the stop time, and the emitter energy output shall correspond to the energy reflecte d from a target 9990 meters distant.  Laser Module:-The Laser Module consists of several components/assembly that receives high voltage from the Power Supply Module (in the Electronic Module) and charges the storage capacitor, when the Charge Switch is pre ssed. The Pulse Forming Network(PFN) uses a capacitor to store energy during the Charge cycle. When the capacitor is fully charged, the ready indicator illuminates. The laser, consisting of the flash lamp,laser rod,Q-switch assembly and partial mirror asse mbly, produces an output beam. This beam travels through the Output Collimating Telescope, which is made up of a corner cube prism, telescope objective lenses, and the(visible light filter) output window. Electronics Module:- The Electronics Module consist s of several modules/switches. The Power Supply Module,depending on the position of the Mode Switch, supplies; 5Vdc to the specified circuits in the Optics and Laser Modules. 12 Vdc to the Receiver Module circuits in the Optics Module. Switched 24 Vdc.High  Voltage for the laser Module (700 to 850 Vdc.)The Mode Switch connects battery power to the Power Supply Module circuits.The Mode Switch has 4 positions: OFF, FIRST RTN, LAST RTN, TEST (PULL).With the Mode Switch in FIRST RTN or LAST RTN, the charge switc h will initiate the charging of the PFN(Pulse Forming Network) capacitor in the Laser Module and,when the capacitor reaches the set voltage level,the ready indicator will illuminate in the display to the left of the range digits. CECOM prefers an Indefinit e Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)type contract to be awarded at the Mid of FY 2004 Performance Specifications for all these 3 spares(Modules);MIL-O-49251, MIL-L-49250, and MIL-E-49252 respectively are available upon request. This is not a request for p roposals. Interested suppliers must include vendor brochures which detail comprehensive/complete information on technical and critical performence characteristics. Sample items/hardware are desired but not required and will not be returned. Closing date fo r responses is 21 days after the publication of this announcement.

<DESC>NUWCDIV Newport intends to award a Fixed Price contract to High Test Laboratories, Inc., Arvonia, VA for the shipping, refurbishment, equipment installation, testing services, and storage facilities required to support the underwater explosive shock testing of the TTL TACTOM AUR on the SSN 688 Class and SSN 774 Class Submarine shock test fixtures.  The intent of this testing is to shock qualify the TTL TACTOM AUR for SSN 688, SSN 774, and SSN 21 Class Submarines.  The tasking shall consist of 1) Shipping of GFE barges and shock test fixtures from Aberdeen Test Center, MD to Hi-Test Lab facilites; 2) Barge and shock test fixture refurbishment and shock test fixture installation; 3) Setting up a work area with velocity meters, test instrumentation cabling and high speed video; 4) Conduct UNDEX Shock Tests; 5) Test Results Report; 6) Contingency Operations/Emergency Repairs; 7) Secure Stowage of the TTL TACTOM AUR classified SECRET; 8) Optional Testing:  Testing under the basic contract will include 10 tests.  However, in anticipation of the need for additional tests the contractor shall provide cost options for each additional UNDEX test on a per test basis; 9) The contractor shall provide an estimate for data recording and cabling for 32 channels of GFE instrumentation for each shot.
The basis for the sole source is that the shock test fixtures were constructed by the principal owners and operators of what is now High Test Laboratories (HTL).  The TTL TACTOM UAR qualification test objectives require the Navy to obtain the shame shock response as that obtained during historical Navy conducted FSP testing.  To achieve this goal, the test fixtures must be restored to their original as build condition to the maximum extent possible.  The shock tests are already calibrated to HTIs test facility.  Thus the refurbishment and repair of these fixtures must be conducted by those directly involved with the initial design, construction and test of the fixtures, which are unique to HTL.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NAICS:  541380.

<DESC>Solicitation Notice, NAICS Code 541512   Title: Inspection and Maintenance (IM) Database Warehouse.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks proposals to provide it with a contract to develop a searchable database for tracking Inspection and Maintenance Onboard Diagnostic (OBD) program data.  This work is in support of the Office of Air and Radiation/Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OAR/OTAQ). 	In conjunction with the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA), EPA is required to set guidelines for states to follow in designing and running vehicle IM programs.  Along with distinguishing between basic and enhanced IM programs, these guidelines must clarify how states are to meet other minimum design requirements set by the CAA.  	The contractor shall develop a stand-alone, multi-dimensional analysis database warehouse and query server to provide EPA with a tool to extract IM data based on user-defined queries.  Reports shall be provided via pre-defined formats with the capability to download all data fields from a given set of test records at the user's request.  Because the IM program data will be provided to EPA in varying formats, the contractor shall be responsible for simple quality assurance data checks to verify the fields in the aggregate database accessed by the query tool are properly populated.  The database architecture shall be sufficiently flexible to allow for additional or unexpected fields to be easily incorporated.  Additionally, a User Guide explaining the operation of the search engine will be a final deliverable under the subsequent award. 	The Government anticipates the award of a Firm-Fixed Fee contract with a Performance Period of eight (8) months after contract award.  The solicitation is subject to Full and Open competition.  The full Statement of Work will be included as an attachment to the solicitation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal provides the Best Value to the EPA, technical, price and other factors considered.  The full Technical Evaluation Criteria will be included in the solicitation. 	The solicitation will be available on or about 28 January 2004 at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd   It is estimated proposals will be required within 15 days of solicitation issuance.  POC for this solicitation is Camille Warfield, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2095, or via e-mail at Warfield.Camille@epa.gov  Telephonic requests will not be honored.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency.  FAR Part 12 procedures may be used.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE:  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 13, 2004.    

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), will be soliciting offers for a contract(s) to survey trees for detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in conjunction with officials of the State of Illinois.  APHIS is planning to survey trees that are hosts for the ALB for signs of infestation.  The program is necessary to reduce the potential for damage of tress from this major pest.  The Asian longhorned beetle bores into and kills a variety of tree species including f maple, elm, chestnut, birch, poplar, ash, and willow.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture has declared an emergency and is committing extensive resources to eliminate this pest and restore the urban forest.  The work will include survey by bucket truck, tree climber, or any other means to thoroughly inspect trees on public and private property as directed.  The Asian longhorned beetle currently infests the following areas in the Chicago area of the State of Illinois:  Chicago, Revenswood, Kilbourn Park, Addison (DuPage County), Summit and All Saints.  APHIS reserves the right to award more than one contract, however, at this time the Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a single contract for the Chicago area.  Firm-fixed price contract(s) will be awarded, covering the period from date of award through September 30, 2004, and will include four unilateral option years.  A post award orientation will be scheduled. Tree surveying services will begin on or about March 1, 2004.  SIC Code:  0783; Small Business Size Standard: $5.0 million average annual receipts over three years.  All responsible sources may submit an offer for consideration, however, evaluation preference will be given to responsive and responsible offerors that qualify as Hubzone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or women-owned small businesses, in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified for the solicitation.  The solicitation will be released on or about January 13, 2004.  To download a copy of the solicitation, please visit our web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html.  The government intends to provide the solicitation and all amendments via this web site only.  NOTIFICATIONS WILL NOT BE SENT TO OFFEROR REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF THE SOLICITATION NOR ANY OF ITS AMENDMENTS.  IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THIS WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR UPDATES.

Interested parties may submit a proposal, which shall include a performance work statement, performance metrics and incentives program, identification of key personnel, quality certifications, data package, past performance, subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9 or a request for waiver if no subcontracting opportunities, and a price proposal for the following :  U.S. COAST GUARD, HU25 SLAT REPAIR/OVERHAUL, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25s leading edge slats.  Over the years the slats have been cannibalized and repaired several times.  Repaired slats do not meet the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) critical profile and contour dimensions for fit to aircraft which contributes to excessive labor hours during installation.  History shows that a complete disassembly of HU-25 slats is necessary for thorough inspections, which commonly require outer skin replacement.  Slats are serial number tracked under the Coast Guards Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  In order to maintain better configuration control, the Coast Guard has assigned and labeled slats with unique Coast Guard part numbers reflecting complete slat assemblies (see ARSC Control Drawing 925-267).
2.0	OBJECTIVE

A.	The Coast Guards objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 slat assemblies.  Repaired/overhauled slats must meet the OEMs critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal trimming and adjustment during slat installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair/overhaul. 
	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for leading edge slats.  First, a baseline repair would be required for slats that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage. This would require skin replacement and hardware.  Second, overhauls would be required for slats that also exhibit significant wear and/or internal corrosion.  The offeror shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline skin replacement.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror's technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, non-serviceable slat storage, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul slats.
	The offerors responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Centers (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  
B.	To meet the Coast Guards objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 
1.	Technical
a.	Provide detailed work specifications for slat baseline repair and overhaul
b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan TO INCLUDE INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO METING OR EXCEEDING MISSION CRITICAL PERFORMANCE METRICS.
c.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard
d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEMs critical profile and contour dimensions per the OEM drawings listed in paragraph 3.0.
e.	Provide separate price breakdowns for slat baseline repair and overhaul
	Note: The Coast Guard considers a baseline repair as replacement of slat skins and required hardware to make complete slat assemblies.  An overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes replacement of internal assemblies and costly cannibalized components (i.e. bearing and rail supports, internal structures, rails, movable rib assemblies, etc.)
2.	Past Performance  
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items
b.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
		a.	OEM drawings: 
	1.	M20H137010B1, slat series, Inboard Slat
	2.	M20H137030B2, slat series, Center Slat

52.212-2	Evaluation  Commercial Items (Jan 1999), award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance, The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.
§	The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposals relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:
o	Factor 1 Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 2  Performance Measures and Metrics
o	Factor 3  Past Performance
o	Factor 4  Cost/Price

Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal.

Encl:  (1) Detailed factors
 

DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractors solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of slat refurbishment (repair/overhaul).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractors team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Contractors validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance.  E.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.
 

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractors past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractors actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractors cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractors proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractors technical proposal.

<DESC>Due to budget constraints, the Government acquisition team was required to reassess the technical requirements of this solicitation.  This reassessment has caused the Government to delay the re-competition.  Due to this delay caused by the necessary changes in the requirements, the current contract had to be extended to ensure continuity of services.  The extension consisted of a two-month basic period with four one-month options.  The Government anticipates performance to begin on a new contract in the first quarter of FY 2004.  This solicitation's offer due date will be indicated in Block 8 of the SF1449 in Amendment 0002.  This Amendment will be posted within the next week.

<RESPDATE>022504
<CONTACT>MARGARET RHINESMITH, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3050
<DESC>The previous notice is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety as follows. The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research,  Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is contemplating an award of a 100% small business set-aside  requirement to manufacture fullscale, inert M231 and M232 Training Aids that contain sectioned M241 and M242 charges in their corresponding sectioned  metal ammunition storage containers.  The 155mm M231/M232 propelling charges  known as Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) are two different propelling  charges designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, that provide a complete  zoning solution for 155MM Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic  increment.  During development and fielding of the MACS Charge, the U.S. Army  TACOM-ARDEC has previously contracted for the creation of full-scale displays  and reduced-scale training aids of the MACS to illustrate charge construction,  packaging and field application.  The M231 charges are used at lower zones  (Zones 1 & 2), while the M232 Charges are used at higher zones (Zones 3  through 6.  The training aids include production of thirty (30) M241 and thirty (30) M242 Packaged Cutaways that are displayed in their metal ammunition storage container.  Since the soldiers will be trained on the  cutaways, it is required that they are of the same quality and construction as the live version using inert materials.  Before submitting the drawing  requirement, the cutaway training aid can be seen at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ by  submitting a request to lchang@pica.army.mil, (973) 724-7402. The offeror is  required to include product marking and assembly drawings showing detailed  design and construction of the M241 and M242 sectioned Training Aids. The  offeror shall also provide a plan detailing receipt of raw materials and  manufacturing of the M241 and M242 Training Aids.  The offeror shall include  drawing(s) and plan in their proposal to the U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC for  approval.  The MACS and their components are on the Militarily Critical  Technologies List (MCTL), Aug 1996. Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by  the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. Sec 2751) and is subject to DoD  Directives 5230.224 and 5230.25. Request all information be submitted via  electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil, Margaret Rhinesmith, (973)  724-3050.  Large files need to be compressed using WinZip,  http://www.winzip.com.  See Numbered Notes 1, 8, and 25.

<SUBJECT>A--Develop and demonstrate technologies to detect,access,render safe, and dispose of unexploded ordnance (UXO)
<SOLNBR>BAA04002
<RESPDATE>032504
<CONTACT>Renee Brown 301-744-6653 Georgia Warder 301-744-6679
<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division has a need to develop and demonstrate technologies to detect, access, examine, render safe, and dispose of unexploded ordnance (UXO).  White Papers/Full proposals for exploratory development are sought in the following areas: 1) Locate hidden devices: Locating an improvised device in a closed area is currently accomplished using remotely operated video cameras.  The insertion of these cameras by teleoperated vehicles through cut access holes in the enclosure may cause initiation of anti-intrusion devices.  Sensors that can unobtrusively localize these devices are required. 2) Devices to safe electronic fuzes: The preferred methods of rendering any item safe are to place the fuzing in the safe position or remove the fuzing from the item entirely.  Advances in the development of Electronically Safed and Armed Fuze (ESA F) devices will drastically change the capabilities required by the EOD technician.  The ESAF tool will be designed to allow the technician to easily "turn off" the fuzing of the system.  The technician needs a universal tool that can interrogate the ESAF device and send signals to the ESAF device to safe itself. 3) Detection/Location of Explosives: The state-of-the-art techniques used to detect and locate energetic materials are not sufficient to positively identify the presence of explosives in improvised devices.  Manual searches are time consuming and present physical danger to personnel.  Dogs are effective but must be trained, maintained, and are not always available when needed.  Current electronic sensors do not provide the same level of capability as dogs.  New sensors must be developed and fielded that can detect trace and bulk explosives. 4) Ensure UXO/IED is inact ive: The advent of ESAF devices will yield fuzes that cannot be readily inspected because of their solid-state configuration.  Electronic monitoring devices are needed to determine the state of these fuzes. 5) Examine improvised devices without actuating sensors: The equipment currently used by the EOD technician to examine an improvised device could cause initiation of advanced anti-tampering sensors.  New examination sensors and techniques are needed that counter this threat. 6) Detect standoff munitions: The next generation of area denial munitions will be capable of detecting and attacking targets from stand off distances due to internal sensors or command initiation.  These munitions must be detected from beyond this stand off distance to ensure the safety of the EOD technician.  Detectable characteristics of these munitions such as low frequency radio waves can be resea rched and appropriate detector sensors developed. 7) Examine standoff munitions: Some weapons contain sensors that function the munitions when a target is detected.  These weapons currently use magnetic influence fuzes, trip wires, IR sensors, and will likely incorporate more sophisticated sensors in the future.  The weapons must be interrogated from a standoff distance to ensure the safety of the EOD technician.  Electronic counter-sensors and special techniques should be developed to determine the configuration and status of standoff weapons from a safe distance. 8) Robotic arm: Multi-articulated robotic arm and robotic support technology development to aid in rendering safe explosive devices. 9) Tactile technology: Technology to allow EOD technicians to feel sensations encountered by robotic arms. 10) Electro active polymer actuators: Develop electro active polymer actua tors for use in robotic propulsion and/or robotic arms.  11) Recognition of underwater targets: Current EOD detection systems provide the user with data that are not filtered or enhanced to alert the operator to possible targets.  Aural data provide the user with a wealth of information but the human processing system is unable to distinguish between targets without a large amount of training and constant use of the device.  Visual data are supplied to user on a standard visual display terminal, usually in gray scale.  The user becomes easily fatigued and must review printed copy of the data to ensure all possible targets are identified.  Advances in signal processing and sensory presentation could be used to alert the operator to possible targets. General Requirements for White Papers and Full Proposals:  White Papers/full proposals shall be submitted to the following ad dress:  NAVSEA Indian Head Surface Warfare, Attn: Bldg. 1558, 101 Strauss Avenue, Indian Head, MD  20640-5035.

<DESC>The Program Office for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program within the US Air Force is projecting a potential requirement for replacement of the Radio Interference Measuring Set (RIMS) system components which have become logistically unsupportable.  RIMS supports the Solar Electro-Optical Network (SEON), which is comprised of the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) and the Solar Observing Optical Network (SOON).  RIMS and the Solar Radio Spectrograph (SRS) are the major systems which comprise the RSTN.  RIMS detects radio flares on the solar disk by analyzing the microwave spectrum at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, 8880, and 15400 MHz.  It is projected that components selected for replacement will be installed at four Air Force solar observatories; Sagamore Hill MA, Palehua HI, San Vito IT and Learmonth AU.  This planned effort provides for:  (1) A supportability analysis of the existing components which make up the RIMS system.  (2) A recommendation for component replacement.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC is seeking contractors to develop procedures for the preparation of EOD Safing and Down-Loading Procedures for U.S. and Foreign  Ground Based Weapon Systems. The objective of this new project is to develop EOD Procedures for ground-based  combat systems and weapons utilized by U.S. ground forces and potential threat  nations for infantry, armor, anti-armor, air defense, and direct and indirect  fire support operations.    The EOD Procedures shall facilitate the positive  identification, safing of the ground combat systems and weapons, and the  subsequent removal of munitions that are fired by the combat systems and  weapons to render them safe from explosive ordnance.  The scope of U.S. and  foreign combat systems and weapons is comprised of the following family of  systems: individual infantry weapons, main battle tanks, light-armored infantry  combat vehicles, light-armored amphibious vehicles, armored personnel carriers,  armored cars, self-propelled guns and howitzers, towed guns and howitzers,  multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, recoilless guns, shoulder fired  rocket launchers, grenade launchers, ground to air anti-aircraft missile  launchers, and ground to ground missiles and rocket launchers.   The procedures  are intended for use by the U.S. Army EOD, Special Forces Units, and  potentially other U.S. Army units including engineers, and infantry/mechanized  units. Requirements:   The contractor shall prepare procedures that shall enable EOD  and non-EOD soldiers to achieve the following objectives: a.	identification of the combat vehicle/system/weapon. b.	Safe access to the interior of the vehicle/system to accomplish safe  shutdown, and safing operations for primary and secondary armaments. c.	Safing of the armaments and munitions on-board the combat  vehicle/system. d.	Removal of ammunition, missiles, rockets, propellants, projectiles, and  other explosive ordnance that are stowed, chambered in gun tubes or  autoloaders, launchers, ammunition racks, or in some part of mechanized  ammunition storage and retrieval systems on board the combat vehicle.  Removal  of loaded ammunition on individual weapons.   e.	Avoidance of hazards on board the combat vehicle.   The safe unloading  of ammunition in individual weapons.   f.	Identify type and quantities of explosive ordnance on-board the combat  vehicle/system.  Identification of munitions used by individual weapons.  Offerors will be required to include documented proof in the proposal that  they will be able to gain use of the systems they are offering their services  (documentation can be in the form of a signed statement by the owner of the  systems acknowledging to offeror that they will be given use of the  vehicles/systems for purpose of procedures development and validation.  It must  have the means for EOD to verify its validity).   Some of the systems may only  be available OCONUS.  Travel and per diem costs for systems only available in  OCONUS will not be included in the targeted price.  They will be separately  included in offeror's proposal.   This is a market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a  request for proposal or as an obligation on part of the US Government.  The US  Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market  survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<DESC>A firebomb is a thin-skinned container of fuel gel designed for use against dug-in troops, supply installations, wooden structures, and land convoys. Firebombs rupture upon impact and spread burning fuel gel on surrounding objects. One or more ignite rs and fuzes are used to ignite the fuel gel mixture upon impact. Firebombs are used primarily for low level attacks. The Mk 77 Mod 5 firebomb holds approximately 75 gallons of fuel gel mixture and weighs approximately 500 pounds when filled. The container is cigar-shaped, non-stabilized (will tumble end over end when released from the aircraft), lightweight, and is made of aluminum. It has a 14-inch suspension between the lugs and provides two filler holes, which are 31 degrees down from the t op of the container. The filler holes are covered by filler caps, which are secured by retainer rings. The filler caps prevent foreign objects from getting inside the container during shipping and storage, and provide a sealed closure after the container i s filled with fuel gel before fuzing. The filler holes also provide for the installation of the primary fuses. During fuzing procedures, the filler caps are removed and replaced by igniters, which seals the closure. The production of this item basically requires welding of the aluminum bomb sections in a specific shape, casting filler caps, and a 10 PSI air pressure test for leaks.  Fuel gelling mixture beads and MS3314 Suspension Lugs will be government furnished mat erial. Top level drawings are available upon request. Interested parties should send a written response to Mary C. Hill as above, email: hillm@osc.army.mil, phone 309-782-6654.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of intent to make a sole-source, firm fixed price award to Joint Management Services.
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole-source award to Joint Management Services. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the OSD Net Assessment, Washington, DC. This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. OSD Net Assessment has a requirement for a base year + 2 one (1) year option periods for services for a follow-on effort to contract DASW01-00-C-3006. Services include the following: 1. Managing absorption of new technologies such as UAVs within the force structure of the Air Force, 2. Establishing the primacy of network centric warfare within the Dept of the Navy for in-depth assessment (two areas for preparatory investigation are: promoting strategies for managing jointness down echelon and institutionalizing new training methods and refresher concepts for the second training revolution). This effort will undertake a significant extension of the Principal-Agent Model developed in the original contract (listed above) for explaining success at managing the path of military transformation. To date, the focus has been on developing a new model that attributes the propensity for institutionalizing innovation in military command and control systems to different patterns of strategic interaction between commanders and subordinates within an organization that are tasked with carrying out specific missions in a changing task environment. Within all four of the areas proposed for analysis, Principal/Agent modeling can identify a number of crosscutting features that would promote organizational change leading to the development of recommendations to affect transformation. An analysis of these crosscutting features will identify strategies for managers to circumvent or overcome barriers to adoption of new or novel technologies, techniques and organizational forms that would be transformational. The resultant strategies will be directed at overcoming internal resistance and leveraging an organization's professional culture.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities or submit proposals. This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the government will consider all proposals received within 5 days after the date of publication of this synopsis. All expressions of interest shall be faxed to 703-787-1009 (Attn: Lydia Hendershot) or emailed to Lydia.Hendershot@mms.gov for consideration by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<ARCHDATE>01122005
<CONTACT>Susan Benik Contract Specialist 7037871350     Susan.Benik@mms.gov;
<DESC>A - DONATIONS INFORMATION, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH DESCRIPTION: The Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks, on behalf of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking a potential contractor to provide donations information and guidance support for the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance.  The services under this project fall into the following general categories: 1.	Donor Inquiry Response and Guidance:  Respond to public, corporate, and governmental inquiries related to donations and other forms of assistance for international disaster assistance.  2.	Public Education and Targeted Outreach:  Develop and implement public education activities and material and a targeted outreach campaign to guide the public and specific groups on appropriate donations for international disaster victims.   3.	Information Management for Appropriate Donations:  Develop and maintain a website with appropriate donations guidelines and other information useful in educating the public on this issue.   BACKGROUND:   With nearly instantaneous information about international disasters available 24 hours a day, the American public is bombarded with images of pain and suffering as a result of disasters overseas.  During such disasters, the American public tends to respond generously with donations.  Most of these donations are made in cash, which allows receiving agencies to quickly and efficiently purchase specific goods and services that are needed to relieve suffering.   However, the public also often responds with well-intentioned but unsolicited and inappropriate commodities and services that can create problems of their own.   American individuals and groups interested in making donations need to be informed as to appropriate and helpful responses to foreign disasters.  Therefore, OFDA is seeking a contractor to educate the public and targeted groups who may want to offer help for disaster victims overseas, and to provide assistance to the USG with disaster-related donations issues, with the overall goal of reducing the level of inappropriate commodity and service contributions.   SCOPE OF WORK:  The following tasks will comprise the scope of work for this project: 1.  Response to Private Donor Inquiries:  The Contractor will efficiently and knowledgeably respond to inquiries from the public regarding donations and other forms of assistance for international disaster assistance.   Inquiries may come by letters, phone, fax, or email.  Referrals to the contractor can be from USAID, NGOs and humanitarian agencies, web searches, Congressional staffers, the media, and others.  The Contractor shall refer offers of cash assistance to a list of humanitarian organizations accepting donations.  For non-cash offers of assistance, the Contractor shall provide guidance on the pitfalls and hurdles related to commodity contributions, in an attempt to channel donors toward cash donations.  For the occasional commodity contribution offer that is considered by USAID to be appropriate and useful (note:  USAID anticipates that this will be a rare occurrence), the Contractor will make the offer known to the humanitarian community. 2.  Surge Capacity:  For surge periods of high-profile disasters, the Contractor will have the capacity to increase resources to a level sufficient to respond to private donor inquiries.  During surge periods, the OFDA CTO may also require the Contractor to establish and staff a call-center, to which USAID may transfer calls received at its 1-800-USAID-RELIEF number.   3.  Humanitarian Linkages:  The Contractor will establish and maintain ongoing linkages with humanitarian organizations, including NGOs and donor agencies.  Such linkages will allow for quick and appropriate referrals of private donors to humanitarian organizations.   4.  Active Facilitation of Fundraising and Monetization Efforts:  The Contractor will have the capacity to work individually with certain groups that feel that simple cash contributions will not meet their needs.  The Contractor will work with such groups to develop fundraising programs that can provide the same feeling of satisfaction and connection to the affected population as commodity contributions.   5.  Active Facilitation of Select Private Donor Offers of Assistance:  The Contractor will be prepared to actively work with select donors (identified by USAID), in order to direct proffered assistance into useful activities, advising on how, with whom, on what activity, and in what area to provide such assistance.   6.  Ongoing Public Education and Targeted Outreach:  The Contractor will develop and implement public education and outreach activities on an ongoing basis to educate the public, private groups, and corporations on appropriate private assistance in disaster regions.   7.  Internal USAID Coordination:  The Contractor shall become familiar with all USAID-sponsored projects and initiatives, and USAID-registered organizations, that are designed to link the private donor community with beneficiaries overseas.  The Contractor will thus be able to serve as a single point of contact for private groups and individuals wishing to take advantage of such projects.   8.  Information Management:  The Contractor will develop and maintain a website with appropriate donations guidelines and other information useful in educating the public on this issue.  The website should encourage cash donations and explain the negative consequences of inappropriate commodity contributions Note that the focus of this scope of work is on donations information and referrals, and public education.  Operational provision of humanitarian assistance is not anticipated under this contract.  Matching of commodity offers with operational humanitarian organizations is expected to be the exception rather than the rule, and will always be subject to USAID approval in advance.  Active solicitation of any form of public donation is not a part of this contract.  Shipping of commodity contributions will not be financed under this contract. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be one year with four (4) one year options. The Government anticipates a time and materials contract. In order to compete for this contract, Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM, February 20, 2004, a capability statement describing:  (1) Project Approach / Description; A brief overview of the proposed approach should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the GIK issue, as seen by USAID, and how it will achieve the desired result - a reduced incidence of inappropriate GIK during overseas disasters.  (2) Humanitarian Experience; The Contractor must have considerable experience within the international humanitarian aid community, including NGOs and donors.  (3) Social Marketing Expertise; A large part of this project involves attempted behavior change on the part of the general population.  Bidders will therefore need to demonstrate extensive social marketing expertise. (4) Institutional Capacity and Structure;  Institutional capacity includes the bidder's demonstrated record of conforming to contract or performance requirements and to standards of good workmanship; of forecasting and controlling costs, of adherence to contract schedules; of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and of business-like concern for the interest of the customer  (5) Specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number) for previous related work.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem.  After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  GovWorks intends to notify offerors, approximately 20 business days after receipt of capability statements, of whether or not they are considered "Best Qualified."  Each offeror's Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on the following four factors in descending order of importance: Project Approach / Description Humanitarian Experience  Social Marketing Expertise Institutional Capacity and Structure Offerors shall submit their capability statements in original and six (6) copies to Susan Benik, Contract Specialist, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817.  In addition, offerors shall include one electronic copy on CD-ROM.  Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Questions should be faxed to Susan Benik at (703) 787-1350 or e-mailed to Susan.benik@mms.gov.  Questions should be provided no later than February 01, 2004.  All correspondence should include this full name/company name, address and phone and fax numbers. Requests or questions by telephone are strongly discouraged.
