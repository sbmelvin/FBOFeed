<CONTACT>LYNDA MCCARTHY CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487336     lmacarthy@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for Interpretation of geographic names and other appropriate data from primary and secondary Federal, State, and local maps, and textual material including primary historical documents. The data will be compiled and encoded for the area for the State of Michigan. The main thrust of this Phase II work for the State of Michigan project consists of a systematic search of selected documents in order to identify unrecorded name information and to create new name records to add to those assembled during Phase I.  This procedure needs to be completed before a State or territory volume of The National Gazetteer of the United States of America can be published.  It is important that each person researching name information for Phase II be able to interpret topographic maps and to relate point, line, and area symbols among maps of different and varying scales.  Be able to make reliable judgments on feature identification when comparing maps and relating tectual description  to map symbols on sketch maps for accurate identification on the modern large-scale topographic maps. An understanding of how people use and apply geographic names to the landscape is useful. Should understand how proper names are applied to symbols by map editors and the limitations inherent in the process. Knowledge of the geography and history of the area being worked will greatly improve a researcher's ability to interpret data. Part 1 involves the collection of name data on a master set of work maps. Parts 2 and 3 require the transfer and conversation of both the annotated and printed map data into machine readable form for inclusion into the National Geographic Names Data Base. The Government will provide data entry software developed by the GNIS staff specifically for the program. The NAICS code is 541990. The expected performance period is 48 months from date of award. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. This solicitation will be issued on or about April 14, 2006 and will close at 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time May 16, 2006.  Award will be made subject to availability of funds.  For a copy of the solicitation (06ERSS0019), please visit www.fedbizops.gov or http://ideasec.nbc.gov.    All vendors who wish to submit a proposal must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov.   The planned award date is on or about June 21, 2006. The point of contact for this procurement is Lynda L. McCarthy at lmccarthy@usgs.gov.  Please email any questions.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

This course will provide supervisors and managers with an understanding of the often complex and confusing rules and regulations governing the federal personnel process and provide guidance for common employee performance situations that frequently occur.  The Government believes that in order to maintain continuity of the training services that have already been performed, award of a purchase order to any other source would not be in the Government's best interest. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561990 $5.0 million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed order is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>AmeriCorps*NCCC SE Region Campus
Charleston, South Carolina
Statement of Work
For
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS


AmeriCorps*NCCC is a residential national service program operated by the Corporation for National and Community Service.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is to strengthen communities and develop leaders through team-based national and community service.  Built on the legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, AmeriCorps*NCCC is premised on the belief that civic responsibility is an inherent duty of all citizens and that national service can effectively solve local problems while providing opportunities to learn practical skills and engender a life-long commitment of service to others.  Based on five campuses in Sacramento, CA; Denver, CO; Charleston, SC; Perry Point, MD; and Washington, D.C.; the AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Southeast Region Campus is located at 2231 South Hobson Avenue, Charleston, SC 29405 and serves local community projects, as well as projects in 10 states in the southeast region.  In case of disaster relief, members may be sent to other state locations. 

In July 2006 approximately 315 members (male and female) will arrive at the Southeast Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will include several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test and “PPD testing” for tuberculosis. 
 
On July 11, 2006, we will have 315 members arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination for these members at the provider’s facility on Saturday, July 15, 2006.  We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 315 members within a 12 hour day.

In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 72 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows:

All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to practice medicine.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician, Family Practitioner or Occupational Health Physician must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

-   Opiate Metabolites
               	            -   Cocaine Metabolites
               	            -   Amphetamines 
               	            -   PCP (Phencyclidine)

			-   Methadone
			-   Methaqualone
			-   Prophyphene 

•	Physician recommendations for follow-up, as needed.


B.  DOCUMENTATION OF FINDINGS:

•	Agency physicians and technicians will document all findings on an agreed upon medical form that will be in the members medical chart to address the component parts of the physical examinations.

•	The physician will document if the examined member has any abnormalities that may preclude him/her from participating in rigorous physical activity and/or performing in the AmeriCorps*NCCC program.   

•	The provider will give the documented charts to AmeriCorps*NCCC Personnel, identified as the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison.  

C.	OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PROVIDER  

•	To review the AmeriCorps Medical/Mental Health Information Form on all members prior to the examination.

•	To ensure injured or acutely ill members receive emergency medical treatment in the event of such emergency during their course of stay at the vendor’s facility, if the exams are not conducted on campus.  After applying measures necessary to sustain life and to reduce the possibility of further injury, the providers’ staff will, if necessary, call an ambulance.  All such cases will be reported immediately to the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison. 
 
D.	EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND FACILITIES:

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) seeks white papers describing innovative technology concepts to ensure position accuracy for Mine Counter Measure (MCM)-related assets operating in the littorals.  Joint forces need the ability to accurately define the boundaries encompassing safe maneuver space and to accurately determine the location of platforms operating within the boundaries.  Examples of MCM-related activities to be supported include: establishment of amphibious operating areas, navigation of amphibious vehicles from over-the-horizon onto and through the beach; location of minefields using overhead reconnaissance platforms; and the location of mines using underwater reconnaissance platforms and divers.  Concepts can include GPS-based approaches, virtual marking, and physical marking (land operations only).  All concepts must be compatible with existing operational suites used by Joint forces to generate the common operational picture.  The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts. The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2007 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2009 or earlier.

ONR encourages teaming of academia, industry, University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and government laboratories with a view toward speeding the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.  
  
White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of the offerors in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the operational, technical and logistical feasibility of the concept. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission.  However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its white paper was not identified as promising or if no white paper is submitted.  

Approximately $9,000,000.00 of Applied Research and Advanced Technology (Budget Category 6.2/6.3) funds are anticipated to be available over a three year period beginning October 2006 to conduct this effort.

<DESC>The FAA publishes this announcement to clarify its November 9, 2005, public announcement regarding its Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement (TAMR) requirements.  The FAA plans to consider and possibly negotiate a proposal to be offered by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for the modernization of the four Common ARTS 3E systems located at terminal/tower facilities in Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Louis.  The FAA retains the ability to make a determination regarding the proposal based upon whether the totality of what is proposed is within the best interest of the FAA.  As proposed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin the FAA understands the proposal as: The four sites will remain C-ARTS 3E sites.  As a subcontractor to Raytheon, Lockheed Martin will replace the aging FDAD displays with Arts Color Displays.  LM will also upgrade the processors and local area networks at St. Louis and Minneapolis. After review of a formal proposal submission including cost and price the FAA will determine if this proposal represents the "best value" to the FAA.  Such a proposal has the potential to accelerate the fielding of much needed display upgrades.  It may also offer the opportunity to reduce long term acquisition and support costs.  The FAA reserves the right, in its sole discretion,  not to accept the joint proposal from Raytheon and Lockheed Martin should the parties be unable to come to agreement on mutually acceptable terms and conditions, including price.  In such an event, The FAA reserves its right to pursue a competition for the TAMR requirements.

<DESC>Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal to conduct a Freight Efficiency Study, Field Operational Test (FOTs) and Evaluation as a result of Section 1102(e)(2)(A) of SAFETEA-LU.  In order to gain the widest dissemination, this notice will be published as a special notice as well as a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The acquisition strategy initially published by FMCSA during the Industry Capability Day in Miami, FL on 9 Feb 2006 has changed.  The Government intents to use a two (2) phase approach and anticipates 3 separate procurements of which each will result in one award.  Phase One will consist of a freight study that will include identification of freight inefficiencies and wireless technology solution sets. There will be one solicitation issued for this phase. The second phase contracts will not be awarded until the completion of Phase One. Phase Two will consist of two solicitations. One solicitation is for the conduct of field operational tests and the second is to perform an independent evaluation of the field operational tests results.  This phase will consist of two separate procurements.  The successful vendor from Phase One can also compete under Phase Two.  However, any given vendor can only be selected for one of the awards for Phase Two.  It is anticipated that the Solicitation for Phase One will be released on or about April 28, 2006.  More detailed information as to the type of contract and duration will be included in the Solicitation. Proposals will be due within 30 calendar days after posting of the Solicitation. Questions pertaining to this acquisition shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Ruby Mixon at ruby.mixon@fmcsa.dot.gov and shall use the following subject: "Questions on Solicitation DTMC75-06-R-00011".

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above kits were invited to submit their capabilities in the Sources Sought notice published in FedBizOpps on March 20, 2006.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which, if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency.

This conference is to provide contractors a better understanding of the multiple award construction contract, design-build, and best value process.  If you are interested in attending the conference, please submit a “Base Access Request” by 1200 hours on April 25, 2006.  This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award up to three SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered. AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE. OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED. THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS. This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation will be based on issuance of individual task orders with specific scope of work valued over 30,000,000 yen. Task Orders will be issued as either 100% Plans and Specifications or Design-Build. 100% Plans and Specifications means the design has been completed by the Government and the contractor is to perform the construction only.  Design-build means the contractor performs both the design and construction.  The work to be performed under this contract will be performed primarily in Sasebo, Japan; however, the Government reserves the right to issue work within The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Area of Responsibility.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (Architect-Engineer) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract. In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s). The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project. All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline in Japan.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to KVH Industries, Inc, 50 Enterprise Ctr., Middletown, RI 02842-5279 for the procurement of ten (10) MV103DG Digital Magnetic Compass System, P/N 01-0155-02.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons:  (1) The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service-life design of 21 years.  Currently, the Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC.  Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span.  The Digital Magnetic Compass (DMC) is specifically designed by KVH Industries and is the only Digital Magnetic Compass that is 100% compatible for re-use of the existing LCAC SLEP equipment.  Use of another company’s Digital Magnetic Compass may introduce new or change existing parameters that may do more harm than good to the LCAC system.  Failure of t!  he LCAC system could result in loss of life as well as significant damage and maybe even loss of fleet assets.  Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334511 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.   FSC is 6605.  A request for proposal will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 28 April 2006.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.  The Government has a requirement to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial for Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). NIAID intends to solicit this project utilizing full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about June 15, 2007.  The objective of a contract will be to advance the field of clinical management for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and to determine the optimal outpatient treatment strategy.  If selected the contractor would be expected to provide the scientific, technical, and managerial infrastructure, facilities, and other resources required to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial.  In addition, the contractor must have the ability to determine the efficacy of off-patent oral antimicrobials and/or wound care for the treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection in areas in the U.S, where the prevalence of CA-MRSA is high. An uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection is defined as the presence of wound infection, abscesses, folliculitis, cellulitis or erysipelas. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are defined as the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the relevant disease process from subjects who have not been hospitalized within the previous fourteen (14) days. In order to preserve the efficacy of vancomycin and linezolid, evaluation of these two antimicrobials would not be supported under this effort. In addition, clinical trials of invasive diseases (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomylitis or pneumonia) or clinical trials with hospitalized patients would not be supported under this contract. Clinical trials under this effort would require a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) clinical trial sites. Each clinical trial site, included would also be required to have access to one hundred and twenty (120) subjects with skin and soft tissue infection every three (3) months to ensure enrollment of a minimum of forty (40) subjects every three (3) months.  It is estimated that a total effort of approximately 9.65 FTEs per year will be needed to accomplish this project.  
This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 15, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. NO FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511210   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order to Saepio Technologies, Inc. of Kansas City, Missouri under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain unlimited user access to Saepio's trademarked Agilis Print web-based hosting services and software. This package will enable ENERGY STAR partners to access  online content and creative editing services in support of CPPD's mission to promote energy efficiency through the ENERGY STAR label. ENERGY STAR's 8,000 partners promote energy efficiency as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, an integral part of CPPD's mission. In the past, CPPD  produced CD toolkits to disseminate templates to its partners. This is no longer a viable option as the ENERGY STAR partners do not typically have graphic design software, thereby limiting the level of sophistication of the templates. In addition, CD size constraints limit the breadth of templates  and do not allow for timely updates and distribution of new content (e.g., annual ENERGY STAR factoids and related statistics on ENERGY STAR performance). Saepio's Agilent Print toolkit will allow CPPD to produce templates, branded for ENERGY STAR, that will permit co-branding by partners. With  Saepio's Agilis Print hosting services, CPPD will be able to: (1) deploy new content to partners quickly and easily; (2) ensure partners can edit and customize content without design software; (3) control partner edits to ensure brand and message integrity; (4) approve all creative before partners  produce materials; (5) provide partners with final output options in a variety of file formats; and (6) provide partners with the ability to fulfill printing directly from the software. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210. NO SOLICITATION OR  REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Saepio is the only vendor authorized to provide unlimited licensing and use of a web-based host solution with the aforementioned capabilities. As such, it is the only known source capable of satisfying the Government's requirement. Notwithstanding, any firm  that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered. Responses to posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon  the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northwest Fisheries Science Center located in Seattle, WA intend to procure on a sole source basis with Carol Volk for the development of a monitoring strategy, data management, and analysis plan and product for an integrated status and effectiveness monitoring program in the John Day River Basin.

Background and Objectives

The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest region’s marine and anadromous resources.  To address some of these needs the Conservation Biology Division formed the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program to develop, in tandem with the existing Salmon Science Programs and Salmon Recovery Planning Teams, quantitative tools for assessing population and habitat status and recovery potential and progress.  One of the major projects undertaken by this program is the development of a large-scale comprehensive monitoring program to be implemented in three Columbia River sub-basins.  The primary objective of this project is the development of a rule set to guide the implementation of large-scale monitoring and evaluation programs across the Columbia River basin.  The project will accomplish this goal through the quantitative assessment of status and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation approaches.  The component of the overall project described herein specifically addresses management and analysis of data collected from the John Day, Wenatchee, and Salmon basins and the development of an Implementation Plan for Research, Monitoring and Evaluation (RME) projects in the John Day River (Oregon) basin.

The work is in support of the development of habitat and population status monitoring guidelines for the Bonneville Power Administration’s (BPA) Environmental, Fish and Wildlife (EFW) Program Mainstem / Systemwide Province Provincial Review Process and parallel efforts to define the status and effectiveness monitoring requirements of the 2000, 2004 NMFS Federal Columbia River Power System Biological Opinions.  While these collections of monitoring protocols and program designs have been developed by regional fisheries managers, the program as a whole has never been adequately tested in the Columbia River basin.  To meet the status and effectiveness monitoring components of these needs, a proposal was initially drafted and submitted in response to the programmatic solicitations of the Mainstem/Systemwide Provincial Review.  The resulting proposed status and effectiveness monitoring program seeks to implement landscape and reach scale habitat and population status monitoring in parallel with watershed-scale habitat restoration action effectiveness monitoring for anadromous salmonid populations of the Columbia River basin.  This work has been funded through BPA’s EFW program, with the NOAA NWFSC serving as the primary contractor for this work (BPA Project #2003-017: Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program).  The work required under this requisition is a subcontract to perform specific analysis elements of the overall project and detailed coordination efforts in the John Day River basin.

Carol Volk has extensive experience working with salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia River Basin and western Olympic peninsula regions.  Of particular importance is that for the last two years Dr. Volk has been employed with the project in question as a lead ISEMP staff member on the development of the Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation (RME) programs in the John Day and Wenatchee River basins and as such, brings a unique set of experiences and personal contacts to this work that will provide critical continuity of personnel and work-flow. The period of performance will be from date of award through 12/31/2006. This notice may represent the only official notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration’s Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRA’s intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on March 9, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

Requirement:  (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive).

Overview:  Television services in AETC are currently provided on a one base-one contract basis. The Government seeks to consolidate television services to all thirteen AETC facilities and five Annex locations that meet or exceed the required service level through one command-wide television service contract. The vendor shall provide a "basic package" of channels at a minimal, reasonable cost defined as what is available on the local market for off-Installation subscribers. In accordance with (IAW) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreations (MWR) and Non-Appropriated Funds Instrumentalities (NAFIS) dated 1 October 2002, TV service to billeting is “to include one premium channel” in addition to the “basic package.” The vendor shall provide a “commanders program package” that will include 3 network news channels (ex. CNN, FOX NEWS, CNBC), a network weather channel and local news channels (base specific). A rebroadcasting agreement shall be facilitated by the vendor according to AFI 64-101.1.2 in order for AETC bases to have the ability to rebroadcast available channels (ex. Fox News, CNN, Weather Channel, CNBC, etc.) to desktop users via the base network. The vendor will also provide the option for each base capability for users to have access from their desktop to the Pentagon Access Channel. The cable operator must have or create franchise agreement(s) authorizing the construction or operation of a cable system on a federal installation according to AFI64-101.1.3.1. The vendor shall ensure that the system is designed, installed, and operated in a manner that meets or exceeds the technical standards required or recommended by the FCC as set forth in 47 CFR Part 76. The vendor recognizes that signal leakage or other interference, including emission, radiation, or induction, from the television system that affects the Government's air navigational, communications, or surveillance facilities, or other electronic device or equipment located on the Installation may disrupt or endanger military activities and may pose a threat to the safety of both the public and military personnel. The vendor shall address all necessary actions, including testing, maintenance, and coordination with government personnel to prevent any such leakage or interference. 

System Requirements:
1) The vendor must be able to provide television services to 13 geographically separated CONUS Air Force facilities.

2) The vendor shall deliver television services via any FCC approved method: Cable TV, Satellite TV, and TV over the Network, etc.

3) IAW AFI 65-106, TV service to Air Force facilities is “to include one premium channel,” in addition to the “basic package and local channels.” 

4) A rebroadcasting agreement shall be facilitated by the vendor according to AFI 64-101.1.2 in order for AETC bases to have the ability to rebroadcast a specified package of channels (“commanders program package”) to desktop users via the base network (via Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)).

5) The vendor shall provide a “commanders program package” that will include 3 national network news channels (ex. CNN, FOX NEWS, CNBC), a national network weather channel, and local news channels (base specific).  The “commander’s program package” shall be offered via traditional television distribution (cable/satellite) and also to desktop users via the base network (IPTV).

6) The vendor shall provide the option for each base the access capability to the Pentagon Access Channel.

7) The Government seeks to consolidate television services to reduce the recurring service charges and infrastructure maintenance costs to the Government through use of innovative cost arrangements. Such arrangements could include but are not limited to on-demand services such as movies, video games, live sports, and other forms of entertainment.

System Compatibility: Interested vendors should respond via e-mail their capability statement/information to listed point of contacts. The capabilities statement/information should include as a minimum a detailed description of your service (including requirements/system compatibility, software and hardware maintenance/modification/upgrade requirements), catalog, brochure, business size (i.e., small business, large business, small disadvantaged business, etc.), and prices (including maintenance costs). All contractors must be FCC registered. Current service delivery infrastructure is not compatible with newer delivery technologies (i.e., satellite television). All responses must address overall infrastructure requirements, if applicable, and address conversion from the NTSC standard to the ATSC standard.

Small Business (SB) Set-Aside Determination:
The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to provide the following Industry Question and Government Response.

Question: The FedBizOps website lists an amendment 2 posted on 3-24-06.  However when I go to the NAVAIR website there is no amendment 2 and the same is true for the NECO website.  Is there an amendment 2 and how can I get a copy? 

Response: There was not an amendment 2 to the original solicitation.  I believe the Amendment 02, posted to FedBizOps on 24 March 2006, was created by the NECO website to fix an error they had in their link to the NAVAIR solicitation page.  The only amendment to the solicitation was posted on 8 March 2006 and is available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing%5Fbusiness/open%5Fsolicitations/.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The Request for Proposal will be issued on April 14, 2006.  A pre-proposal conference and site visit is scheduled for May 2, 2006.  The proposal due date is scheduled for June 2, 2006.

The NAICS Code for the solicitation is 236220.  The size standard is $28,500,000.00.  This is a design build project with a maximum funding limitation of $14,400,000.00.  The estimate performance period for design and construction is 554 days from contract award.

1. PROJECT TITLE:  NSWCCD Detachment Bremerton Consolidation, P-364, Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor, Silverdale, WA

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION.  The project will provide design and construction for a 22,380 square feet (sf) combined laboratory building with 80-100 stall paved parking area, a pier to a Government furnished floating pontoon, two prefabricated buildings (1,000 and 2,000 sf, respectively) on the pontoon, civil site improvements to Carlson Spit, and extension of existing base utilities at Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor for the entire project.  Sustainable design features shall be adhered to for the combined laboratory and when possible, the pier.  Anti-Terrorism Force Protection features are required for all facilities and may include setbacks, Intrusion Detection Systems, and other notable features such as card swipe/electronic keypads.  Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) rooms and distribution systems are required as part of this project.

3. SITE ANALYSIS.  The site is located on Naval Station Kitsap at Bangor, Bangor Washington.   The project site is located at Carlson Spit south of the Service Pier, on the Hood Canal. Access to the Spit is via Sealion Road to the Service Pier Access Road onto the Access Road. The new pier will be located on the south side of the Spit. The laboratory facility is located at the southeast corner of Sealion and Wahoo Road.  The existing conditions of Carlson Spit include low vegetation and a gravel surfacing. Some areas of accumulated driftwood are located on the Spit.  There is a small watercraft launch on the northeast portion of the Spit and a small guard shack located in the southwestern portion of the tip. The existing conditions at the Upland Laboratory site include an undeveloped 5-acre forested site with an east to west slope. Trees include alder, fir, and cedar. The site will be logged of all merchantable timber prior to turnover to the Contractor.  

Geotechnical investigations by GeoEngineers for both sites will be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  In preparation for this project, numerous environmental studies and documents have been developed. These studies include a biological assessment (BA), an environmental assessment (EA), and two archaeological assessments. The Environmental Assessment identifies all applicable measures to be taken into account during design and construction to minimize environmental impacts. These measures require compliance. Permits sought for this project include:

¡P	Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) Section 10 Individual Permit
¡P	ƒnCoastal Consistency Determination.
¡P	ƒnHydraulic Project Approval (HPA).

Numerous agency concurrences were obtained from US Fish and Wildlife, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries (aka National Marine Fisheries Service), and Section 106 consultation with the State Historic and Preservation Office (SHPO). Final and approved copies of all environmental compliance documents and studies are provided as part of this RFP as the following attachments:

The Contractor is responsible to follow all mitigation measures as stated in the approved permits provided with the exception of the HPA. The Contractor shall only comply with the water quality mitigation recommendations stated in the HPA.

5.  The Government will award one Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the ¡§best value¡¨ to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Proposers will be evaluated on:  Factor I:  Past Performance & Relevant Experience; Factor II:  Management Capabilities; Factor III:  Basis of Design; Factor IV:  Subcontracting Experience, Achievement and Goals; and Factor V:  Price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiated with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff processes when it may be in the best interest of the Government; to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposers or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  Proposers should be advised THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.

With this experience, BIOREVIEW, Inc. is uniquely qualified to fulfill the needs of the statement of work. BIOREVIEW, Inc. has worked with other ICs at NIH to include NIAMS, and has the necessary experience and training in peer review procedures and policy to assist with a review of this magnitude, complexity, and sensitivity.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted  under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement is not applicable to simplified acquisition.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are required to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes: a firm fixed loaded hourly rate; documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Governments requirements; at least (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government?s minimum specification and a proposed plan.

<DESC>1.	The due date for proposals has been extended to Thursday, June 8, 2006 at 3:00pm EST.

2.	The primary point of contact for RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-07-33 is changed to:

Phil Hastings-Tickerhoff
phastings@niaid.nih.gov
tel. 301-496-0194

3.	The following questions were submitted regarding RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-07-33; the responses are listed below each question. 
 
1.	OVERALL STRUCTURE 

a.	 Does the 300 page limit include appendices? 

RESPONSE: The page limit refers only to the technical proposal (see cover sheet and Attachment 5, page 1 of Appendix A – Additional Proposal Instructions).

b.	 Should SOPs be placed in appendices? Linked to a website? 

RESPONSE:  SOPs are part of the 300 page limit (see references to RFP in 1a, above).  Attachment 5, Appendix A, paragraph E.1.e  refers to providing examples of SOPs for laboratory capabilities; other references to SOPs in the Statement of Work (SOW, Attachment 3) refer to work to be performed by the awardee, e.g., develop and disseminate SOPs for specific work items. 
 
2.	BUDGET 

a.	How should ongoing trial commitments be incorporated into the budget: the detailed budgets for each site in an Appendix, or just a lump sum for each trial listed in the RFP?
 
RESPONSE: The RFP refers to these issues in the sections on Transition Plans.  Attachment 5 (H.1.d of Appendix A) refers to “a plan to establish subcontracts, consulting agreements, …”.  The SOW (Attachment 3, IX.A) states that an Initial Transition Plan, including a plan to establish subcontracts shall be submitted with 6 weeks of the contract award.  Attachment 6, Appendix B, Additional Business Proposal Instructions, Section 3.2.a states that “offerors should assume … clinical trials … in progress … will be transitioned …”.  Section 5 Budget Instructions describes a one page budget summary as well as individual budget breakdowns by research category.

 
3.	TRIAL IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES
 
a.	Please confirm that the RFP requires that the ITN be responsible for Trial implementation. Does the ITN gain oversight of CRO activities or does that remain the responsibility of the NIAID?  This question is based on the following statements in RFP: 
                                    
i.      "assign Protocol Managers to oversee the implementation and conduct of each clinical trial and to serve as the primary contact to the NIAID medical monitors, NIAID project managers, and NIAID regulatory affairs officers." 
                                   
 ii.      “Provide protocol managers to facilitate study implementation, monitor patient accrual and retention, assess compliance with protocol requirements and adherence to study timelines, and report progress to designated NIAID Project Manager.”

iii.      “The primary role of NIAID staff will be to facilitate, but not to 
direct, protocol selection, development and implementation 
activities. NIAID staff and ongoing NIAID clinical research support 
contracts will provide a broad range for services to the Contractor 
for the design, development, implementation and analysis of 
Network studies.” 

RESPONSE: The Network will not be responsible for oversight o current NIAID CRO contractors.  Attachment 34, Appendix E NIAID-Funded Clinical Research Support Services Contracts describes contracts that the NIAID/DAIT holds to support the effort of the Network.  As noted, “… the successful Offeror is expected to interact in order to perform functions specified within the SOW …”.  No oversight role of these contracts by the Network is requested in the RFP.
 
4.	STUDY PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION
 
a.	There is an inconsistency in the RFP related to Drug distribution – which is correct and does the ITN oversee the contractor (Eminent) 
                                   
 i.      FROM SOW: Ensure that all clinical sites receive the required supply of study products for clinical trial initiation and conduct, and monitor supply throughout the duration of the clinical trial. Report to the designated NIAID Project Manager any changes in requirements for study products. 

ii.        FROM TOC: Study Product Distribution: NIAID will:
Manage all activities related to study product distribution, tracking
and retrieval and ensure that such activities are in compliance with
cGCP and consistent with relevant Clinical Trial Agreements, 
where applicable.


RESPONSE:  The Network will not oversee the drug distribution contractor; this remains an NIAID responsibility.  It is expected that the Network will assist NIAID to ensure drug availability through and exchange of information concerning on-site drug supplies and needs.  Attachment 34, Appendix E NIAID-Funded Clinical Research Support Services Contracts describes the role of the NIAID/DAIT Drug Distribution Center, which provides pharmaceutical services to support the Network. The SOW section referenced above (IV.D.8) provides instruction that the Network is monitoring study product at the site level and reports to NIAID any necessary changes. The NIAID would then instruct the drug distribution contractor to address these changes

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
FA4890-05-RFI-0001
DEFINING THE COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT, AND IDENTIFYING COMMUNICATION NEEDS OF ACC AIRMEN AND SHADOW AUDIENCES

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS
Department of the Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC) - HQ ACC CONS, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 401, Langley AFB, A 23665

RESPONSE DATE:  11 April 2006, 5:00 PM EST

RESPOND TO:  Contracting office stated above Attn: Amber Weichbrodt.  See below for format and submission instructions.

ADDITIONAL GENERAL INFORMATION
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about pricing, delivery, and other market information or capabilities for planning purposes.  This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The NAICS code for this potential effort is 541910.

BACKGROUND
The Air Combat Command, Public Affairs (ACC/PA) is seeking to use focused research to define the communication environment and identify communication needs of its Airmen and “shadow audiences” (e.g. retirees and dependents).  Currently, unit-level Public Affairs offices within ACC spend a great deal of time and energy producing a weekly newspaper.  For 18 of the 20 units, this is their “#1 time-consuming product/event.”  Despite the great deal of manpower invested in producing the base newspaper, ACC/PA does not know what impact the paper has.  There is no statistical data to support the assertion that the newspaper is being read; the local newspaper readership surveys are neither scientific nor precise, and they do not draw from a random sample of a base population.  Along the same lines, the impact of other products the PA offices produce and maintain, like the Commander’s Access Channel and base guides, is also not known.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT
Given the advent of new technology such as podcasting, short messaging service (SMS), rich site summary (RSS) messaging, and the proliferation of older technology, such as the Internet, ACC/PA is interested in obtaining information from industry to determine, through focused research, if there is a better way of communicating key themes and messages with ACC’s Airmen and shadow audiences.  

Generally speaking, ACC/PA needs to answer two broad questions:
1) How do ACC’s Airmen and shadow audiences obtain news and information?
-	Do they get it from TV?  The Web?  The base newspaper? Their friends?  Their 1st Sgts?
-	In looking at this, it is important to not limit questions to, “How do Airmen get news about the Air Force.”  They may get their Air Force news from their 1st Sgts, but get other news at home when they go to ESPN.com or download their favorite podcast.
o	An effective study will dig down and find out how Airmen and shadow audiences learn about the world in which they live
2)	How do ACC’s Airmen WANT to get information about the Air Force?”  
-	Do Airmen and shadow audiences like base newspaper?  Would they prefer RSS, podcasts, etc.
-	And, is there a correlation between how they SAY they want to get their information and how they currently get their information.  
o	For example, if 90% of Airmen and shadow audiences say they want their news via SMS, but only 3% of them have SMS-enabled phones, we need to know that.

Responders must clearly describe their technical approach to conducting the research, including the methodology (e.g. focus groups, a scientific survey of a statistically significant representative population, etc.), provide a schedule estimate and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate of costs, as well as a brief company description and any other information deemed relevant (e.g. products and services, involvement in projects similar in scope to this RFI).  The Government may use the information provided by responders to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  

All responders are requested to indicate their business status, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, etc. 

FORMAT & PAGE LIMITATION
Submittals should be provided on standard letter size 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper, limited to a maximum of 18 single spaced pages.  The font for text should not be smaller than Microsoft Word Times New Roman 10 point font, normal proportional spacing.  The responder may use oversize pages (including “foldouts”) where appropriate to contain graphic presentations.  Oversize pages do not count as extra pages within the page limitations.  Existing commercial documentation and product literature can also be submitted and is not subject to page limitation.  

SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION
Information/documentation packages are due to the contracting office identified below by 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, 11 April 2006.  Responders shall provide one hard copy and one electronic copy (on CD-ROM in Microsoft Word or .pdf format) of their documentation.  All disks should be virus checked prior to submission, and clearly labeled with the responder’s name and contact information.  **If any information submitted is considered to be proprietary, then that specific information should be marked accordingly. 

Documentation shall be delivered to the Contract Manager at the following address:

This is a sole source solicitation for the supplies listed in Section B for both DLA stock locations and military customers around the world.  CONTRACT SCOPE:  The scope of this long-term initiative is items for which Rix Industries is an approved source and/or items which Rix Industries has supplied in the past directly or through dealers, whether or not the NSNs are ultimately procured from Rix Industries, Cage Code 28953.  438 NSNs are included in this initial grouping (see listing of NSNs below).  Award will be made on an ALL OR NONE BASIS per NSN for the supplies covered under this contract.

Specifications, plans or drawings are NOT AVAILABLE.  This is an UNRESTRICTED acquisition.  Other Than Full and Open Competitive procedures apply.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a requirement for annual hardware and software maintenance and support on two (2) Leica Geosystems DSW700 and one (1) DSW600 digital scanning workstations.  This equipment must be maintained in full operating condition by certified Leica trained technicians in order to insure proper maintenance, and replacement parts and software updates must be compatible with existing Leica equipment.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified supplies and services as a sole source procurement from Leica Geosystems GIS & Mapping, LLC, 61 Inverness Drive East, Suite 200, Englewood, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Pacific Northwest Regional Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory and assistance services with the Okanogan Conservation District (OCD) of Okanogan, WA to support and improve the operations of Reclamation's Columbia/Snake Salmon Recovery Office (CSRO) Tributary Habitat Program. Reclamation is one of nine Federal agencies, collectively known as the Federal Caucus, which has natural resource responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to coordinate a comprehensive, long-term strategy to restore threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead throughout the Columbia-Snake River Basin of the Pacific Northwest, which includes the Methow River subbasin. Reclamation has determined that OCD is the only reasonable source based upon the following criteria: Knowledge of the current state of habitat conditions for ESA endangered and threatened species in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance associated with the habitat improvement efforts in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance regarding the local social and political issues that affect project initiation under tributary habitat programs in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance involving multiple Federal, state, tribal, and local agencies for improvement of fish habitat in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance in implementing fish habitat improvement projects in the Methow subbasin and obtaining third-party funding for their construction; experience and past performance of successfully interacting with local landowners and other interested parties within the Methow subbasin for improvement of fish habitat; and price. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.  See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>J--Remotely Operated Pilot Valve for Seawater Systems
<SOLNBR>N0002406R4207
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer – Thomas Bikowski, 202-781-2819
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to determine if there are interested sources for the replacement of solenoid-operated pilot valves (SOPV) currently in use aboard US Navy ships, or which may be used in future systems.  The valves are currently constructed in accordance NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959218, and most commonly are installed in systems depicted in NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959273.   These drawings may be referred to for an understanding of the functionality of the device, and its current mounting configuration.  Electronic copies of these drawings can be found at the Navy Logistics Library as follows: Go to:  http://www.nll.navsup.navy.mil/ Click:  PUBS/PRODUCTS/TOOLS Click:  NAVSUP DIGITAL DOCUMENTS Click:  Radio Button for NAVICP CONTRACT SUPPORT LIBRARY Click:  DOCUMENT TYPE drop down and select NAVSEA DOCUMENTS Click:  SEARCH Click:  DOCUMENT # SEA0010 Open:  Drawing 803-5959273 or Drawing 803-5959218D Note that mounting configuration and valve type shown, are not intended to indicate limitations at this point.  Instead, this information is to provide an understanding of the functionality of the device and interface connections in existing systems.  The valves must be suitable for use in a Naval combatant ship.  The valve is subject to long periods during which it is not operated, up to several months, after which it may cycle several times in a day, and then be static again for several months.  The seawater being controlled by the valve is from the ship’s firemain (normally 150 to 175 lb/in2) and contains substantial contaminants due to the coarse strainers used in these systems.  While static, the valve would contain stagnant seawater from the ship’s firemain.  Current areas of concern with the SOPV are leakage through the valve shaft seal progressing into the area of the electrical operator, electro-mechanical interface alignment and ease with which the interface comes !  out of alignment.  Scoring of lapped surfaces from grit has also been a concern.  NAVSEA is particularly interested in designs which avoid the sliding surfaces which have been a problem in the past.  If a design has a plug or ball design, an explanation of why it should be considered satisfactory for this service should be provided.  Since the time to actuate an AFFF fire extinguishing system should be minimized, the time for the SOPV alternative to operate should also be minimized.  Responders are requested to address the time for their valve to operate.  Note that the current SOPV is a four-ported valve which in a few cases was deemed useful so that a single SOPV would control two valves simultaneously.  Due to the expected reduced cost of alternative units, NAVSEA is particularly interested in a unit which is only required to operate one valve at a time (a 3-ported valve).  Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead and no later than 2 May 2005, a notice o!  f interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and  e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Douglas Barylski SEA 05P4, 1333 Isaac Hull SE Mail Stop 5149, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5149.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Doug Barylski at 202-781-3612.  The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities and experience that relate to valve and/or mechanical device design and manufacture, brochures, top level drawings showing basic dimensions of possible devices, reliability data such as mean time between failure for proposed or similar devices, and any related information that will assist the Navy in assessing SOPV replacement possibilities.  Multiple alternatives for either future installation or backfit, or both, are welcomed.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.
(c) The USDA APHIS National Center for Animal Health Emergency Management is tasked with establishing a National Veterinary Stockpile.  Under HSPD9 the NVS has been formed, and has as its purpose, provision of the best possible protection against an intentional or unintentional introduction of a Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) or the occurrence of a natural disaster affecting animal agriculture and the food system, which could have adverse public or animal health and environmental or economic effects in the United States. 
APHIS is currently developing response plans to assist with mitigating any potential occurrences of Avian Influenza (AI) within the United States and its territories.  An Agency response to a potential AI occurrence could involve large scale domestic poultry depopulation.  Given the need to contain an AI occurrence and minimize exposure, the depopulation process would need to occur in an expedited and humane process.
Byproducts of any poultry depopulation process such as carcasses will also need to be quickly, safely and legally disposed of in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations and in an environmentally-sound manner.    
(d) The NVS is performing market research to determine what private sector capabilities, technologies and practices exist in the area the poultry depopulation and disposal.  Current planning calls for the use of the most humane animal welfare standards possible, such as the euthanasia methods outlined by the American Veterinary Medical Association and/or the World Organization for Animal Health.  Interested parties are encouraged to respond with information concerning products and techniques that could be used by the agency for safe humane expeditious depopulation.  
The Agency is also seeking information in regard to potential solutions to assist with onsite and/or offsite carcass treatment/disposal.

<DESC>The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking industry sources to acquire the next generation, Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) receiver.  The USSOCOM anticipates a limited development and integration effort (less than 12 months) to meet the requirement with production and sustainment options to follow.  This includes information on existing, producible, ultra high frequency (UHF) satellite communications (SATCOM) radios that provide an IBS receive capability or that support some of the legacy IBS broadcasts.  The USSOCOM is also seeking information on UHF SATCOM radios that are being modified with modern communications security (COMSEC) devices and/or that support demand assigned multiple access (DAMA), continuous phase modulation waveforms.  These radios may be a complete line-replaceable unit (LRU) (i.e., with an embedded power supply, external input/output interfaces, etc.) or a compact Peripheral Component Interconnect (cPCI) form factor (i.e., with embedded COMSEC requiring a host LRU).

The next generation, IBS receiver radio needs to be interoperable with the standards for: dedicated 5-kiloHertz (kHz) and 25-kHz UHF SATCOM channels, UHF SATCOM DAMA order wire messages and protocols, multiple-access 5- and 25-kHz UHF SATCOM channels, and the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) data control layer.  Legacy IBS waveforms include biphase shift key (BPSK), shaped BPSK (SBPSK), and shaped offset QPSK (SOQPSK) modulations.  Reference the following military standards:  MIL-STD-188-181 / 182 / 183.

All interested vendors will be required to have Secret security clearances, COMSEC authorizations, and secure facilities for production.  Information submitted in response to this announcement does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas.   No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.  Capability statements may be e-mailed to Mr. E. J. More at moree@socom.mil no later than April 30, 2006, 2:00 pm EST.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This is a sources sought/market survey announcement to seek industry sources for this requirement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, is currently seeking interested sources of  commercially available thermal barriers to reduce the rate of thermal  transmission to munitions subjected to fires.  Such materials are required to  reduce the reaction of packaged munitions when subjected to adverse thermal  stimuli. These stimuli are caused by accident or hostile action in accordance  with the DODâ€™s Insensitive Munitions Policy.  Thermal barriers must be able to  be integrated into or onto Army munitions packaging systems, without loss or  degradation of packaging performance or adverse impacts on the Army logistics  system.  The integrated packaging systems must also pass sequential rough  handling requirements of MIL-STD-1904 at temperature extremes of -65F to +160F.  In addition, ARDEC will consider conducting optimization activities to improve  the robustness of commercially available thermal barriers to meet military  requirements, if necessary. Interested parties should respond by April 14, 2006 to dondre@pica.army.mil. This survey is not a Solicitation, and should not be construed as such. While a  Solicitation may be generated regarding Thermal Management of Packaged  Munitions for Insensitive Munitions (IM) Enhancement in the future, no follow- on activities are guaranteed. Any costs incurred by a respondent in connection  with this market survey will not be paid for by the government.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Security Clearances for Construction of New NATO Headquarters in Brussels
<DESC>In connection with the construction of the new NATO Headquarters in Brussels, the Belgian Defense Ministry will enter into various major works contracts involving the most advanced modern construction techniques. Apart from the demolition contract, the works contracts involved will be subject to security constraints. Only firms that hold NATO SECRET security clearances can be selected as bidders and hence be awarded construction contracts. Candidate bidders must therefore prove that they hold a NATO SECRET clearance and that, if necessary, requests for renewal have been submitted as required by the national security authority in order to ensure the continuing validity of the clearance.   

The first bids for NATO Headquarters projects will be due in mid-2007. The Belgian Defense Ministry will not accept construction bids from companies without the proper security certification already in place. Most projects will require personnel clearances only; some project solicitations, however, will specify that a facility clearance is also required. As the process for obtaining a facility or personnel clearance can be lengthy (12 months estimated), U.S. firms without current facility and/or personnel clearances are encouraged to apply as soon as possible with the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office. 

PERSONNEL CLEARANCES

A NATO Personnel Clearance Certificate is required for any contractor to negotiate or perform on a NATO classified contract or subcontract. U.S. contractor employees qualify for a NATO personnel clearance if they have an equivalent U.S. clearance and have been briefed on NATO procedures. The Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) will provide the NATO Personnel Clearance Certificate to the requesting NATO command or agency.
When a contractor becomes aware that a NATO Personnel Security Clearance Certificate is required, through a request for proposal (RFP) or other announcement, the contractor should contact the applicable Cognizant Security Office (CSO) for assistance in obtaining the necessary certificate. Upon determining that the requirements have been met, the CSO will request that DISCO forward the Certificate to the NATO contracting staff, command, or agency. DISCO will notify the contractor when the NATO Personnel Security Clearance Certificate has been issued.

SUBCONTRACTORS 

Prior to awarding a subcontract, prior written approval must be obtained from the NATO contracting agency. Subcontractors must have the level of security clearance required for the nature of the work to be done and/or the place where it is to be carried out. In most cases a NATO SECRET clearance will be required. Subcontractor employees must possess the requisite level of personnel security clearance and must be briefed on NATO procedures.  A NATO Personnel Security Clearance Certificate must be issued prior to award of the subcontract. The contractor may sponsor a prospective subcontractor for a NATO personnel clearance only after approval to subcontract has been obtained.

<SUBJECT>R -- A-76 Cost Comparison DOL Employment Standards Administration (ESA) Wage & Hour Division (WHD) National Certification Program Streamlined w/MEO CA Study
<DESC>FORMAL NOTICE OF A76 COMPETITIVE SOURCING STUDY. This notice constitutes the formal announcement and commencement of the A-76 cost comparison study for the DOL Employment Standards Administration (ESA) Wage & Hour Division (WHD) National Certification Program A-76 Streamlined CA Study on 9/28/2005, under the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated 29 May 2003.  The start date is 9/30/2006, until concluded under the Streamlined Competition Process that will include an MEO. This study is expected to be completed on or earlier than June 28, 2006 at which time a formal decision shall be rendered.  However, the Competitive Sourcing Official has granted an extension of 45 additional days if deemed necessary for completion. These services are located in San Francisco, CA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX, Atlanta, GA, Philadelphia, PA, Washington, DC, State of Florida, State of New Jersey, and the State of Virginia and are performed by 10 (FTE) personnel.  Personnel involved in the ESA/WHD study provide, develop or support work that includes clerical, administrative, data entry, mail handling, customer service and other program support activities related to the certification processes required by the Wage and Hour Division under the following legislation/regulations: 
1) Farm Labor [MSPA Title I CFR 29 Chapter V Part 500];
2) Workers with Disabilities [FLSA Section 14(c) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 525];
3) Full Time Students [FLSA Section 14(b) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 519];
4) Homeworker [FLSA Section 11(a) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 530];
5) Student Learner [Section 14(d) CFR 29 Chapter V Part 520].
The activities identified in this competition are performed by function codes I440, D103 and T820, support Contractor (Harris) personnel, and state government personnel from Florida, New Jersey and Virginia.  The purpose of this Streamlined w/MEO A-76 study is to determine whether it is less expensive for industry or the Government to continue to perform the operation as-is, as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity. The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities (CA) functions under several methods to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources. The method chosen by the Department of Labor for ESA/WHD National Certification Program competition is a Streamlined w/MEO study.  Reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Patrick Pizzella, the Agency Tender Official is Mr. Carl Smith, and the Contracting Officer/SSA is Mr. Peter Higginbotham.  The cost comparison process is as follows:  in accordance with the A-76 Circular, and Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Contracting Officer will analyze market pricing information against the Government’s MEO estimate to perform the function and make a final decision.  If it appears that market analyses are properly supported, showing substantive proof that the private/commercial pricing is more cost effective than the government’s, a decision may be made to issue a formal RFP and ultimately go contract.  This is not a RFP, not a request for sources sought, and no solicitation has been developed at this time. A formal cost proposal is not currently being sought from industry.  If the government MEO estimate is more cost effective a decision shall be rendered to retain the function in-house. This will be the only announcement made for this effort.  Any comments should be directed solely to the Director of Competitive Sourcing, Mr. Larry Clark at Clark.Larry@dol.gov.

In order to gain the widest dissemination, this notice will be published as a special notice as well as a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The acquisition strategy initially published by FMCSA during the Industry Capability Day in Miami, FL on 9 Feb 2006 has changed.

Phase One will consist of a freight study that will include identification of freight inefficiencies and wireless technology solution sets. There will be one solicitation issued for this phase. The second phase contracts will not be awarded until the completion of Phase One. Phase Two will consist of two solicitations. One solicitation is for the conduct of field operational tests and the second is to perform an independent evaluation of the field operational tests results.  This phase will consist of two separate procurements.  The successful vendor from Phase One can also compete under Phase Two.  However, any given vendor can only be selected for one of the awards for Phase Two.  It is anticipated that the Solicitation for Phase One will be released on or about April 28, 2006.  More detailed information as to the type of contract and duration will be included in the Solicitation. Proposals will be due within 30 calendar days after posting of the Solicitation.

As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-75, insert the following clause: 
PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

Inverted Domestic Corporation.  A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-789, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the business size standard of $6.0 million.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fogarty International Center (FIC), has a requirement to procure, on a sole source basis, the services from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) which holds the copyright to a majority of the chapters included in the second edition of the World Bank Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries.  

The Disease Control Priorities Project (DCPP) was to produce definitive technical publications to inform national-level and global-level health policy-making, on the basis of extensive analytical work and consultations with technical experts and policy-makers from around the world.  

In 1993, the World Bank published a first edition of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, which examined the priority of 25 conditions based on their public health significance and the cost-effectiveness of preventive and case management interventions in low-income and middle-income developing countries.  The volume was a companion document to the World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report, Investing in Health.  The combined impact of the two publications was to stimulate substantial national and international debate, and to catalyze extensive work on the estimation of the disease burden and the cost-effectiveness of specific health interventions.  Both documents have become reference works used extensively by planners, policy-makers, international development agencies, and academic institutions.  

In August 2002, the Fogarty International Center (FIC) and the World Bank signed a letter of intent (LOI) to publish a second edition of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP-2) in 2005/2006.  The DCPP is a partnership between the FIC, The World Bank, and The World Health Organization that collaborated together to oversee the production of chapters for this volume.  In accordance with the LOI, the Bank’s role was to undertake all editorial and production processes necessary to publish the volume.  As such, the World Bank holds the copyright to a majority of the chapters included in the DCP-2 publication.  The project was funded in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

As a continuation of this collaborative project, the scope of work for this phase will be for the value of the book, Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, for translation of various chapters of the book as well as the companion volume, Priorities in Health, into six languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese), and for the distribution and dissemination of the book to the appropriate entities around the world, in particular to developing countries as identified by the partners.  Additionally, copies will be distributed to additional entities as the partners identify them throughout the dissemination period.

The World Bank, as holder and administrator of copyrights, shall undertake to license the Book in print and electronic formats for translation, for local low-priced English language editions, and to electronic content aggregators.  The FIC, from the grant provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, shall pay all reasonable costs incurred as payment of translation subsidies or purchases from the publishers of copies of the translations in accordance with the legal and administrative requirements.  The World Bank, as holder of copyright, shall be responsible for granting permissions to reprint and excerpt the copyrighted portion of the book.

The dissemination/distribution of the book is primarily targeted to developing countries and remote areas of the world.  The World Bank is the international organization that deals with numerous aspects of developing countries.  They are best suited as they currently have more than 100 country offices and approximately 10,000 employees in these offices.  The Bank has the infrastructure and processes in place to efficiently handle the dissemination/distribution encompassing a wide net, at a reasonable cost.  No other organization has this unique set of abilities and established organization for this scope.  The World Bank can fulfill the range of activities required with a level of experience and expertise unmatched by any other organization.
 
To attempt to obtain these services through any other entity would require permission from the World Bank as copyright holder.  Additionally, if the permission were granted, additional services to establish the processes would be required to complete the request for translation and dissemination/distribution which would be prohibitively costly and time consuming for the Government.

The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items with its offer.  The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercials Items, applies to this acquisition.  The addenda to the clause reads as follows:  The offeror must include in their quotations, the unit price, the list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.  The FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items – Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions, applies to this acquisition.  The clauses are available in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the service specified in this synopsis should submit their quotation to the below address.  Quotations will be due fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis or April 13, 2006.  The quotation must reference “Solicitation number” NIH-NIDDK-06-789.  Quotations must be submitted in writing to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 775, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, Attention:  Patricia Haun.  FAXED COPIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add the Scope of Services which did not go through with the initial announcement.  If you have trouble reading this announcement from www.fbo.gov, go to http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/announcement.jsp.  If you still have trouble, contact Mike Bachofen at 303-987-6977 or email mike_bachofen@nps.gov SCOPE OF SERVICES APPRAISAL SERVICES  FOR SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK CONCID:  SHEN001 CONFIDENTIALITY:  All data, information, and deliverables provided to the Contractor under this order and/or developed by the Contractor under this order are the property of the U.S. Government and shall be kept in strict confidence. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The work under this purchase order shall be provided from approximately May 15, 2006 through October 31, 2006.   I.	OVERVIEW Shenandoah National Park requires appraisal services to value possessory interest in concessioner improvements located on park premises.  The possessory interest is granted by Concession Contract No. CC-SHEN001-85 (concession contract) between ARAMARK Sports and Entertainment Services, Inc. (ARAMARK) (concessioner) and the National Park Service (NPS).  The concessioner has a right of compensation for its possessory interest in concessioner improvements as defined by the concession contract. The concessioner is entitled to be paid this compensation by a successful offeror for the new concession contract that is to go into effect as of January 1, 2007. The measure of the compensation ("sound value") is described below.      It is the objective of this task directive to identify to the Contractor the work necessary to determine the sound value of the concessioner's possessory interest in concessioner improvements under the terms of the concession contract as further defined below.  II. SCOPE OF POSSESSORY INTEREST COMPENSATION VALUATION   A. Definitions  " "Concessioner improvements" (further defined by Section 6(a) of the concession contract) are buildings, structures, fixtures, equipment, and other improvements, affixed to or resting upon the lands assigned to the concessioner in such manner as to be part of the realty that the concessioner has provided for the purposes of the concession contract.                   " "Possessory interest" (further defined in Section 6(b) of the concession contract) is a contractual right to compensation for the sound value of concessioner improvements. Possessory interest is generally described as:   ¿all incidents of ownership, except legal title, which is vested in the United States.  However, possessory interest shall not be construed to include or imply any authority, privilege, or right to operate or engage in any business or other activity and the use or enjoyment of any structure, fixture, or improvement in which the concessioner has a possessory interest shall be wholly subject to the applicable provisions of the Concession Contract and to the laws and regulations relating to the park.    " "Sound value" of concessioner improvements (further defined in Section 13(b) of the concession contract) is the reconstruction cost of the concessioner improvements less depreciation evidenced by their its condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind, but not to exceed fair market value.  " "Reconstruction cost" in accordance with law is synonymous with the term "reproduction cost"' as defined on page 188 of "The Appraisal of Real Estate," 3rd, Ed., prepared by the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers; i.e., "reproduction cost is the present cost of replacing [the improvement] with as nearly an exact replica as modern materials and equipment will permit."   " "Fair Market Value" is considered synonymous with "market value."  The Contractor shall cite the market value definition contained in the UASFLA.   B. Clarification of "Possessory Interest" and "Sound Value" Under the terms of the concession contract, possessory interest: 1.	does not extend to land that is owned by the United States, 2.	does not include personal property of any nature, and 3.	does not include the "authority, privilege, or right to operate or engage in any business or other activity."  (reference).   Item # 3 (above) means that while it is apparent that USA intends to allow a Concession Contractor to conduct certain uses of property, USA does not guarantee that those uses will continue to be allowed (for any reason) at the sole discretion of USA.  The possibility that uses allowed under a concession contract may be modified, suspended, or ceased, is a known risk, accepted by a Concessioner that may affect the value of improvements.   In estimating the compensation to be paid to a concessioner for a possessory interest, the Appraisal Contractor is required to meet the test (definitional requirements) of the term "possessory interest".   Compensation for a possessory interest requires that the Concessioner receive "sound value" for the Concessioner's improvements.  To estimate "sound value", the Appraisal Contractor must: 1.	Estimate the worth of the Concessioner's improvements by conducting a "unit-in-place" reconstruction/reproduction cost take off estimate.  The current cost value of improvements must be factored to account for depreciation evidenced by condition and serviceability.  This means that the current cost "as new" must be reduced for all forms of depreciation; physical, functional, and external. In addition, USA does not consider that entrepreneurial profit/incentive is an element of sound value for the following reasons: a.	the Concessioner has no titled interest in the Real Estate b.	the Concessioner is not competing within the market under typical terms c.	the improvements already exist therefore there is no risk associated with a construction costs estimate, and d.	Entrepreneurial profit, while targeted by developers, only manifests when Fair Market Value of a completed improvement exceeds its construction costs. As sound value is contractually limited to the lesser of construction costs or Fair Market Value it is procedurally impossible for Entrepreneurial profit to exist in an estimate of Possessory Interest Compensation. Estimate the fair market value of the improvements.  Estimating Fair Market Value of Concessioner's improvements must take into consideration all the contractual limitations on use and utility and be reflective of only the contractual interests for use that the Concessioner holds.  III. SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED A.  IN GENERAL  The required work product is a Complete, Self-Contained appraisal report of the sound value of the concessioner's possessory interest in concessioner improvements under the terms of the concession contract. The report shall comply with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA), the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), and the appraisal guidelines set forth herein.  Please note, USPAP compliance will not yield UASFLA compliance; therefore, the provisions of the UASFLA take precedence over the provisions of the USPAP.   Furthermore, when additional guidance is necessary (i.e., not covered by the two standards or this scope of work statement), the Contractor shall refer to, and follow, the guidance offered by the Appraisal Institute's The Appraisal of Real Estate (12th Edition),  A certified appraiser with the professional designation "Member, Appraisal Institute" (MAI) will complete the appraisal assignment.  The individual appraiser will be identified by the Contractor for approval by the Department of Interior. Condition assessment data provided to the Contractor or gathered under this task order should be adjusted based upon expected useful life, consumer price indices, recent condition assessment information (deficiencies, design life, remaining life, reproduction and depreciation analysis) and all other material provided to the Contractor. All materials provided to the Contractor shall be read by the Contractor.  Their relevance to the appraisal shall be explained, upon request, by personnel of the area.  The concessioner improvements that are the subject of this appraisal owned (held in title by) the United States Government and assigned to the concessioner by the concession contract. . The concession contract commenced on January 1, 1985, for a term of 20 years. The concession contract has been extended to December 31, 2006.  B.	ASSIGNMENT PLANNING Prior to the commencement of the appraisal, the Contractor shall review existing facility, financial and market information available.  In many cases the amount of information available to the Contractor will be extensive. C.	APPRAISAL REPORT The following subheadings relate to specific sections within a Self Contained appraisal report and identify considerations specific to the appraisal.  Assumptions and Limiting Conditions "	Clearly state assignment-specific assumptions and limiting conditions and explain how they differ from typical circumstances. "	Reiterate comments that may be made in other areas of the appraisal that provide the reader with an understanding of how the valuation of possessory interest in concessioner improvements, based on the terms of the concession contract, differs from the valuation of real property in typical market transactions. History of the Property "	Consider any transaction relating to the interest appraised during the 10 years preceding the date of value, if any.   These may include transfers or assignments of the concession contract to another entity, subsequent construction or improvements to facilities. "	Sale and transfer transactions involving concessioner improvements are always part of the sale and transfer of the concession contract in its entirety. Accordingly, the Contractor must attempt to derive an allocation of the purchase price for the concession contract to the assumed purchase price of concessioner improvements.  Rights Appraised "	Identify the rights under consideration, as the concept of possessory interest is not commonly used in typical market transaction.  It is therefore likely to be misunderstood by users of the appraisal unless thoughtfully presented. "	Provide an abstract of the concession contract provisions that gives rise to the possessory interest in concessioner improvements. "	Describe the provisions in sufficient detail to demonstrate that only the possessory interest is being valued, being careful to describe other aspects of the facilities and operations as related to, but not a part of, the appraisal. Purpose of the Appraisal "	The purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the sound value of the concessioner's possessory interest in concessioner improvements under the terms of the concession contract. .  Date of Value "	 Possessory Interest is valued at the time of its transfer.   "	The appraiser is required to provide two value conclusions.  "	The first value conclusion is the current value as of the date of inspection.  "	The second value conclusion is a retrospective value opinion as of 9/4/91 to provide a sound value basis for the calculations indentified in Amendment 1 and 2 attached.    "	Site Description "	Describe all site improvements, indicating any that belong to the concessioner, together with their condition, age, and other elements necessary for subsequent cost analysis. "	Describe nature and extent of government-owned land and government-owned site improvements, including infrastructure and utilities, in order to accurately identify the appropriate return to the government for the use of these benefits in the valuation section of the appraisal. Property Description "	Describe the concessioner improvements. See the attached "Summary of Concessioner. "	Describe the size, quality, effective age, and other descriptive elements of the concessioner improvements so as to provide an accurate basis for calculating reproduction cost. (See the attached "Condition Assessment."   "	Enhance property descriptions with photos, NPS maps, and other graphics as appropriate, including NPS-provided aerial photographs, or other materials that may be available.  Describe the concessioner's operations in sufficient detail to understand any constraints imposed or benefits derived as a result of the operating environment within a national park.  "	Describe (overview - not detailed) furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) (personal property only), recognizing that FF&E that is personal property is not included in possessory interest calculations.  However, the extent and nature of personal property FF&E will play a role in establishing an appropriate reserve account when performing the income approach.  Furthermore, the contributory value of FF&E should be removed from the income capitalization technique. Property Taxes "	Consider property taxes, even though concessions on NPS property generally pay no property taxes.  The park will provide the appropriate information.  "	Investigate assessments and taxes of comparable off-site properties in order to accurately develop an estimate of the benefits derived by the concessioner for this tax relief, if applicable. Area and Neighborhood Analysis "	Describe the impact of the park area and the concession operation on the surrounding community, including such topics as seasonality, limits on growth, etc. "	Local economic analysis should support the Contractor's conclusions regarding availability of labor, spending patterns, market-based utility charges, and other aspects underlying the valuation section of the report. D.  MARKET ANALYSIS This section of the appraisal shall provide much of the basis for making market-based adjustments to the concessioner's actual profit & loss statement. The real property analysis Contractor will provide the Contractor with copies of rate comparability studies and five years of approved rates for services such as lodging.  The Contractor will work with this contractor to develop the market analysis. "	Survey supply and demand factors for each significant component of the concessioner's possessory interest.  For example, if the concessioner has a possessory interest in a lodging facility, it is incumbent upon the Contractor to examine other lodging facilities in and around the national park.  Relevant factors to investigate are a function of local market conditions but typically include such considerations as occupancy levels, average room rates, expense trends, and the like.  For example, the concessioner is required to have their rates approved in accordance with NPS guidelines, which could have an effect on the revenue stream as compared to other businesses that operate without this oversight. "	Clearly distinguish between demand trends in-park vs. off-park.  That is, demand and pricing for in-park services such as lodging vs. off-park services of a comparable quality level.  This analysis is necessary to justify adjustments in the income capitalization approach, such as the fair return to the site. "	Carefully distinguish the impact of park regulations versus operating factors that affect in-park and off-park properties alike.  For instance, if a park has a seasonal closing that is inconsistent with natural visitation trends (relating to weather, mud or other causes), then this may represent a form of external obsolescence due to government controls.  However, if the seasonality affects in-park and off-park properties equally, there is no need to make an adjustment in the valuation. "	Discuss and consider as applicable the economic advantages of the by virtues of location within a national park, including, without limitation, lack of direct competition, reduced marketing expenses due to the park area's "destination" draw; and high occupancy and visitation rates.     E.  HIGHEST AND BEST USE "	Consider constraints on the highest and best use of the property due to governmental oversight.  Because the concessioner is not free to materially alter the property without the prior approval of NPS, the main concern under Highest and Best Use is to evaluate what is the best use of the property as improved.  The management documents that may include the General Management Plan, Development Concept Plans and variety of implementation plans and NPS policies in effect at the park, may provide some of the characteristics that a zoning or building code would in a municipality.  Similarly the park's mission, or charter, to enable visitors to experience the park limits the use of improvements to visitor-related functions.  As such, the Contractor should consider such resources when estimating Highest & Best Use. F.  APPROACHES TO VALUE Organize the valuation section of the appraisal report to set forth depreciated reproduction cost and fair market value of the concessioner's possessory interest in concessioner improvements. To insure that all forms of accrued depreciation are properly recognized, the Contractor should be guided by the guidance offered in the 12th Edition of the Appraisal of Real Estate. "	The three approaches to market value must be considered. When evaluating the concessioner's actual income statements, the Contractor must remove all recognized income components that do not specifically derive from concessioner's improvements.  G.  DEDUCTIONS FROM INCOME AND MARKET APPROACH ESTIMATE "	Subtract the cost of any deferred maintenance, the value of the concessioner's inventory, and the value of any furnishings, fixtures and equipment ("FF&E").  Imminent deferred maintenance, which will be cured prior to a new concession contract, includes items of deterioration that need to be fixed immediately.  One example might be new ceiling tiles for a ballroom where a leak had caused enough damage to make the room un-rentable. The concessioner's inventory will sold at its book value. The sale is performed as a separate transaction between the concessioner and a new concessioner. "	The appraiser will be provided with a personal property report and the appraiser should determine and analyze the report and determine how the personal property contributes to the overall final value.  The scope of the personal property report has been provided for your review and consideration   H   REPRODUCTION COST "	A Real Property Assessment Report was conducted in November 2004.  Condition and reproduction cost estimates, as well as deferred maintenance assessment, will be completed by March 2006.  This work should be considered for determining reproduction cost less depreciation.   "	Analyze the Real Property Assessment Report to determine if it is suitable for use in the appraisal. Collect additional information, as required, to estimate the reproduction cost of concessioner's improvements. See previous statements regarding accuracy of this report.  "	Consider the various methods for estimating cost; however, given the many unique attributes of concessioner's improvements in a national park, the quantity survey method is typically preferred.  If the Contractor is considering a method other than the quantity survey method, this point must be discussed in advance with the NPS. I.  DEPRECIATION "	In the majority of cases the breakdown method will be the most appropriate way in which to measure depreciation associated with concessioner improvements.   "	All three forms of depreciation are to be evaluated including physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and external obsolescence.  Refer to The Appraisal of Real Estate for general guidance concerning the proper method of quantification of all forms of depreciation. IV.	SUBCONTRACTORS The report is to be completed by the Contractor, and/or by members of his/her staff who are employees of the Contractor's firm under the Contractor's direct supervision.  The NPS must approve any use of subcontractors, including professional cost estimators, prior to the commencement of the assignment.  If the Contractor intends to use a subcontractor (non-employee) for any portion of the analysis of the report leading to value conclusions, the following must be furnished in advance and approved: "	The names, addresses, qualifications, current employer, and immediate contact telephone numbers of such subcontractors; "	A description of the work that the subcontractor will be performing on this assignment; "	Disclosure of any relationships between the Contractor and any of the subcontractors. As stated above, the Contractor shall rely upon the previously completed Financial Feasibility Report (or Annual Financial Reports) and Real Property Assessment Report, as provided by the NPS.  V.	DELIVERABLES Deliverables are detailed in the following paragraphs: "	Two draft copies of the Complete, Self-Contained appraisal report are due within 45 days of commencing work.  NPS will have 30 days to review the draft and provide comments to the Contractor. "	Two full hard copy narrative appraisal reports and one final version of the report in electronic form 15 days after NPS comments are received. A certified appraiser with the professional designation Member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI) will complete these appraisals. VI.	DATA AND MATERIALS PROVIDED BY NPS The items outlined herein will be provided or made available by NPS upon award of the task order for the purpose of completing the services required under this task directive.  All data and materials provided by NPS are strictly confidential, and may not be duplicated or released in any way to the public.

Statement of Work/Specifications

A.1 Introduction:
The U.S.Department of Commerce(DOC),National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA),Aircraft Operations Center (AOC),MacDill AFB,Florida, intends to exchange four T56-A-14 engines in “as is” condition with complete logbooks for one, 0.0 hour(all modules) Time Since Overhaul (TSO)T56-A-14 engine in “Ready for Installation”(RFI) condition with logbooks and two,overhauled to zero time PT6A-27 engines with logbooks.

A.2 Background:	
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operate two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. Four Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines power each WP-3D.  NOAA also operates a fleet of four DeHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine. Currently, NOAA has two spare, RFI T56-A-14 engines. With the projected acquisition of a third P-3C, NOAA anticipates the requirement for one additional spare,0.0 hour Time Since Overhaul(TSO),RFI T56-A-14 engine. Additionally, NOAA does not have any spare zero time engines for the fleet of Twin Otters. With the ever increasing amount of annual flight hours flown by these aircraft,it would be in NOAA’s best interest to have two spare,0.0 hour TSO PT6A-27 engines. The NOAA AOC in Tampa, Florida,manages these aircraft.

A.3 Scope:
Engines to be exchanged are as follows:

-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH9044 with 14,804.5 hrs Time Since New (TSN)

<DESC>More Questions and Answers:

1.)  Is it acceptable to quote newer Cisco products where applicable to those that are specified by DCMA that will provide DCMA faster speeds and longer field lifetime? 

ANSWER:  No, please only quote products that are specified. 

( 2. ) I have been unable to see on Fed Biz Ops the exact time that the RFQ is due on April 4.  Also, I have been trying to get special bid prices for this large opportunity from Cisco and I am having difficulty getting the approvals due to their National sales meeting this week.  Is there any chance of getting a time extension so that I can provide this special pricing that I have been able to provide in the past to DCMA? 

ANSWERS:  Procurement call, but we  need to get this going. 
 
 
( 3. ) Part # "MEM2600XM-128D" which is listed twice in the RFQ (column 1, item 3 and column 4, item 3) does not specify if this is an additional 128mb module required or the 128mb that comes with the router at no cost. 

ANSWERS:  Please specify if you want total memory of 128mb or 256mb.  All of the other memory part #s listed specify that they are additional upgrades but this particular part # is unclear.  This is additional memory. The total requirement is 256mb. 
 
Please remember to include my KO Sue Gerardo on emails on matters pertaining to the Cisco Solicitations.
