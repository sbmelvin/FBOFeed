<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) and Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will continue to provide highly technical work in producing 10 year estimates of all national past expenditures, 10 year projections on future spending, and special cost and utilization reports--addressing all expenditures on public and private mental health services and substance abuse treatment (MH/SA). The methodology used to develop the estimates and projections will be parallel to those used previously under the Spending Estimates Project (i.e., National Expenditures on Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Treatment, 1991 – 2001, DHHS Pub No. SMA-05-3999) and is produced to be comparable to the overall national expenditures that are produced by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  The SAMHSA spending estimates will also capture and segregate detailed additional MH/SA expenditures and MH/SA providers not included in the CMS National Health Accounts. The Spending Estimates Project requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge. The technical capabilities include: actuarial research and estimation, econometric techniques, projections and forecasting methods, ability to input missing information, understanding of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases (both surveys and claims), detailed actuarial knowledge with the national health accounts, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, and sound judgment about data quality and usefulness. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to improve the spending estimates and the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences. In addition to these technical capabilities, national MH/SA policy expertise is necessary. Such knowledge must encompass a detailed understanding of mental health and substance abuse treatment services, spending, and financing; knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse; as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing. 
To carry out this project the contractor shall accomplish the following: 
A)	Propose and implement a methodology for making 10 year spending estimates and for making 10 year projections that provide for continuity and consistency with previous sets of MH/SA estimates disseminated by SAMHSA. Each year, evaluate produced reports/articles and make recommendations prior to the next round of estimates or projections for improvements in the methodology that has been previously developed. Review of pertinent literature in methods, cost reporting and new or changed national databases is included. 
B)	Develop estimates for at least a ten-year period of national MH/SA spending that parallel the previous sets of MH/SA estimates undertaken by SAMHSA and are consistent with estimates of general health care spending produced by the CMS. This includes utilization of the same categories of payment and service type that are employed in the general CMS Health Accounts estimates. In addition, estimates for these categories should be further disaggregated by the type of MH/SA service and diagnosis (i.e., MH/SA, MH, SA, Alcohol and Drug Treatment). 
C)	Develop projections of future MH/SA spending across a 10 year period.  Forecasting methods available should be assessed for usefulness and blended methods used, if this would provide the best projections.  As the total time period of past estimates lengthens, increasingly sophisticated methods should be possible.
D)	Prepare a variety of special reports integrating financing policy concerns of the current mental health and substance abuse treatment literature and trends, highlighting policy relevant findings.  These special reports will explore cost, service utilization, special populations or other trends to further refine the spending estimates and to explore the factors that affect the trends in spending.  

The anticipated period of performance is a three years with two 1 year option periods. 

The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is March 24, 2006 with proposal responses due April 25, 2006. This solicitation may be obtained in any of four ways; by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20852; FedBizOpps; or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http://alt.samhsa.gov/contracts/index.html.

<SUBJECT>A -- Hybrid Insect MEMS (HI-MEMS)
<SOLNBR>BAA06-22
<RESPDATE>060506
<ARCHDATE>03092007
<CONTACT>Amit Lal, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 571-218-4682, Fax 703-248-1933, Email amit.lal@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Hybrid Insect MEMS.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement upon existing state-of-the-art.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals to develop technology to create insect-cyborgs, possibly enabled by intimately integrating microsystems within insects, during their early stages of metamorphoses. The healing processes from one metamorphic stage to the next stage are expected to yield more reliable bio-electromechanical interface to insects, as compared to adhesively bonded systems to adult insects. Once these platforms are integrated, various microsystem payloads can be mounted on the platforms with the goal of controlling insect locomotion, sense local environment, and scavenge power. Multidisciplinary teams of engineers, physicists, and biologists are expected to work together to develop new technologies utilizing insect biology, while developing foundations for the new field of insect cyborg engineering. The HI-MEMS may also serve as vehicles to conduct research to answer basic questions in biology.

The final demonstration goal of the HI-MEMS program is the delivery of an insect within five meters of a specific target located at hundred meters away, using electronic remote control, and/or global positioning system (GPS).  Although flying insects are of great interest (e.g. moths and dragonflies), hopping and swimming insects could also meet final demonstration goals. In conjunction with delivery, the insect must remain stationary either indefinitely or until otherwise instructed.  The insect-cyborg must also be able to transmit data from DOD relevant sensors, yielding information about the local environment. These sensors can include gas sensors, microphones, video, etc.  

In order to successfully demonstrate the mission described above, it is anticipated that effort in the following technical areas is required: 

1. Demonstrate reliable bio-electromechanical interfaces to insects, 
2.	Demonstrate locomotion control using MEMS platforms, and
3.	Demonstrate technologies to scavenge power from insects.

The HI-MEMS program is expected to be a three phase fundamental research and development effort, with an additional phase to transition the technology to DOD systems. Each phase should have options to continue to next phase. As the scope of potential methods to achieve program demonstration goal is large, applicants to this program are required to determine their own milestones for yearly reviews, which if not met could lead to early project termination. Both the timeliness and capability of reaching ones own metrics, and the aggressiveness and technical merits of the milestones will be equally weighed. The proposer’s capability to reach the milestones at the scheduled reviews, and being successful at the final demonstration will be critical to HI-MEMS success. Therefore, proposers should provide an in-depth justification for the milestones and schedule.


Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-22 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below. In particular, teams needing more information are encouraged to attend the Proposers Day Conference, described in the BAA 06-22 Proposer Information Pamphlet.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-06-22/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Amit Lal, phone: (571) 218-4682, fax:  (703) 248-1933; electronic mail: amit.lal@darpa.mi 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-22, Hybrid Insect Micro Systems, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on Hybrid Insect Micro Systems, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to issue a solicitation for the design-build of a new facility and infrastructure.  DOE requires building facilities and infrastructure to be constructed at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) 510 Security Gate, currently located 1Â½ miles north of US 95 at Lathrop Wells. A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $5M - $10M. The construction period is expected to last 180 calendar days. This requirement will be a competitive, 100% small business set-aside.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed price contract. The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220 with a size standard of $28.5M. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available through the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) on or about April 17, 2006 under RFP Number DE-RP28-06RW12369.  You may register and access the IIPS system at http://e-center.doe.gov.  The RFP will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.500 and 5.102(a)(1), therefore, hard copies will not be provided. There will not be any printed or hard copies of the RFP mailed. Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the RFP. NOTE: The RFP will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same. Please submit by March 31, 2006, an e-mail to rosa_gomez@ymp.gov referencing the anticipated RFP Number and project title if you intend to propose. This e-mail should also include your companyâ€™s name and information (i.e. address, phone number) and a statement of qualifications in design-build construction. This information will only be used to determine the magnitude of interested parties.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) has a requirement for the procurement of Multifunctional Demodulators capable of supporting the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES).  The procurement will be a two phase process.  The goal of phase one will be to select a demodulator and obtain three units for extended parallel operations with the existing GOES demodulators at the Wallops Command Data Acquisition (CDA) facility.  Successful parallel testing will initiate phase two, the procurement of thirty three additional units.  In the event that the phase one parallel testing of the demodulators reveals any issues that suggest noncompliance with the specifications, NOAA retains the right to either work with the contractor to bring all issues into compliance in a reasonable amount of time, or return to the selection process of phase one.  The applicable NAICS number is 334290 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted.  The solicitation, notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (FedBizOpps) site at www.fedbizopps/.  No paper copies will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile or written requests will be accepted.  When the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  The solicitation will be issued as a commercial item acquisition on or about March 9, 2006, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures.  To be eligible for award, offerors must have a valid DUNS Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<SUBJECT>K -- BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM SPIRAL 3
<SOLNBR>FA8722-05-C-0003
<CONTACT>ROBERT  BROWN robert.brown@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Department of the Air Force, Electronics Systems Center, CC2SG/PK at Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 intends to award a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract to Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS) Company, (1801 Hughes Drive Fullerton, CA 92833-2249) to provide critical data links, capabilities for BCS Fixed and Mobile.  This contracting effort will develop and deliver Common Battle Management Software (CBMS), Spiral 3 Sentry software updates for the BCS-F and M systems, as well as system documentation. It will also provide unique system training, integration, logistics support for each system and associated engineering feasibility/system support studies. Due to funding and development constraints, the CBMS spirals will be implemented using Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV)  in obtaining requirements in the BCS System Capability Document (SCD).  Requirements not met under Spiral 3 will be incorporated into future spirals.   This is a follow-on to the original effort, which is on contract with TRS under contract number FA8722-05-C-0003. Spiral 3 will serve to implement CAIV requirements listed as priority 2’s in the BCS-F (Spiral 1) SCD currently on contract (F19628-03-C-0045) as well as the following:  XML TBMCS interface, AN/TPS-75 mode 4, remote operator workstations, increased system capacities, Air Control Order integration, Link 16 improvements, network centric migration, hardware tech refresh for BCS-F, NATO Link 1, Mode 5, Weather XML interface, world wide coordinates, SIAP migration, Link 16 message sets and Sim, C2 decision tools, Enhanced Traffic Management System, and Distributed Mission Operations.  The current effort for "Spiral 3" will have a period of performance (POP) of approximately 24 months. A Sources Sought Synopsis was published in FEDBIZOPS on 7 May 04 under the title “Battle Control System (BCS) Spiral 3 & 4 Software Build (Contract F19628-03-C-0045). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Thales-Raytheon Systems Company, LLC under authority of FAR 6-302-1(a)(2)(ii) entitled "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:" Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c)1.  The Government considers that an award to any source other than TRS would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation for the BCS software would incur substantial duplication of costs, which would not be recovered through competition. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  Additionally, this notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project. 

This project is the second phase of the modernization of the courthouse.  The project's scope of work consists of considerable exterior repair, including window replacement and glazing, tuck-pointing, replacement of the main roof, and structural areaway repairs.  This phase of the project will also complete the lobby renovation, the historic renovation of the public spaces on the upper floors, and the renovation of all public restrooms in the building.  An additional district court room and support space will be constructed on the first floor.  All generators and motors will be replaced in the passenger elevators; all motors, controls, and cables will be replaced in the freight elevators.

The boiler plant will be replaced and a new Judge's Chambers, Grand Jury Suite, and U.S. Attorney Satellite Office will be constructed.     

The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Preconstruction phase services with the Construction phase services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc will be brought onto the project during the design phase, during which he/she can be effective at controlling design-related costs and developing construction sequencing activities.

The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project and shall have a full understanding of the project, the contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

The Construction phase services (Option) of this project shall include, but are not limited to administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc's internal personnel or under subcontract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, commissioning and other required LEED services.  The CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau of Global Health, is requesting expressions of interest (EEI) from capable firms willing to provide indoor residual spraying (IRS) services in Africa. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals (RFP) for this procurement will be issued by the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (M/OAA), USAID, within a few weeks of the publication of this notice. The proposed procurement will comprise (1) full and open competition; and (2) small business set-aside. All firms expressing interests in this procurement shall indicate their status, and for small and disadvantaged minority firms only, please indicate whether you intend to compete in the set-aside or full and open competition. Also, in order to ensure that offerors have access to the widest range of small business subcontractors, USAID strongly encourages offerors to use the Subnet link under www.fedbizopps.gov. M/OAA intends to award five-year (5-year) multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts resulting from the RFP, subject to USAID’s option to renew. Concurrently with the award of the IRS contract, M/OAA intends to award the first task order to one of multiple awardees. The expected maximum shared ceiling amount  for this IQC is $150 million. The Statement of Work (SOW) is as follows: (A) BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Recognizing the urgent need for a dramatic scaling-up of the effort against malaria, on June 30, 2005, President George W. Bush announced a new U.S. Government Malaria Initiative of $1.2 billion over the next five years. This new initiative, beginning with $30 million in bilateral funding in FY 06 and increasing each year to a peak of $500 million through FY 10, will be provided to combat the disease. The Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI) is intended to accelerate delivery of a package of proven preventive and curative interventions in over 15 to-be-named high-burden African countries with a total population of 175 million. The program is expected to reduce malaria deaths by fifty percent (50%) by achieving eighty-five percent (85%) coverage of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), prevention with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPT).  (B) PURPOSE: The purpose of the IQC is to establish a world-wide procurement mechanism to support the PMI, as well as USAID Missions and Bureaus with malaria programs outside the PMI countries, and to implement USAID’s goal of reducing the burden of malaria in Africa. (C) OBJECTIVES: (1) To prepare and execute logistical plans for IRS related commodity procurement and distribution, including the purchase, storage and handling of sprayers, insecticides and any other supplies required to carry out the proposed IRS operations in the identified African countries; (2) To provide operational management support (i.e. field supervision, operations planning, day-to-day implementation management) to IRS activities, primarily in the PMI focus countries but also in other countries where USAID supports malaria programs;(3) Ensure compliance with all US Government environmental regulations, including the conduct of Environmental Impact Assessments in accordance with 22 CFR 216; (4) Furnish expert short- and long-term technical assistance for IRS activities; and (5) Organize skills training for capacity development and on-going supervision and monitoring for safe and effective spraying in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. (D) SCOPE OF SERVICES: Pursuant to these goals, the contractor shall provide malaria vector control services to USAID Missions, the USAID/Washington Global Health Bureau, and other USAID Bureaus and operating units; provide, as requested by USAID Missions and other operating units, IRS related commodities procurement and logistical services; plan, organize, manage and implement IRS programs; conduct USAID Mission requested host-country environmental impact assessments (when required); provide long- and short-term technical assistance; and provide advisory and monitoring services to host country institutions (both governmental and non-governmental) to implement effective IRS programs. Task orders issued by the requesting USAID operating unit will define the precise specifications and activity requirements.  Activity requirements may include determining insecticide choice, insecticide storage, human resource requirements, logistical needs, training, monitoring, evaluation, and other activities required for effective IRS programs. (E) CONTRACT MANAGEMENT: The cognizant technical office that shall manage the proposed IQC will be the Global Health Bureau, USAID Washington, D.C. All EEIs requesting the above RFP shall be in writing and be electronically directed to Benjamin Duodu, Contract Specialist, M/OAA/GH/OHA, through bduodu@usaid.gov. Telephonic or fax EEIs shall not be accepted. END OF SOW. Contracting Officer: Bruce Baltas, Team Leader, M/OAA/GH/HSR

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   Notice of intent to award a sole source delivery order under the procedures in FAR 8.4 to Entrix, Inc., located at 5252 Westchester, Houston, TX 77005.  Applicable NAICS code is 541690.  In January 2004, a competitive Request for Quotation was issued to obtain technical services to develop a cell-based assay using the H295R cell line to detect chemicals that interfere with the synthesis of steroid hormones.  Entrix, Inc. was awarded the delivery order and their performance under the order has led to the development of an initial protocol.  The work under this  initial order has identified a number of problem areas and a plan to investigate and resolve them.  A review of the data from the first series of studies has led to the conclusion that additional experimental work is necessary to determine the causes of variability and standardize the assay prior  to commencing formal interlaboratory validation studies.  Resolution of these issues should result in an optimized protocol that can meet EPA's objective to develop a cell-based assay to reliably detect chemicals that interfere with steroid hormone synthesis.  This order will provide for the  determination of the underlying causes of the variability obtained in the first series of studies, the development of an optimized protocol based on this information, and the conduct of an interlaboratory study to complete the validation process.  The Contractor shall serve as the lead laboratory  for this effort.    THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to US EPA, Attn: Sara Longabach (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460, or  sent by email to longabach.sara@epa.gov.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must be submitted within five (5) days after this electronic posting.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response  to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Secretary, Ministry of Ports and Aviation, Aviation Office, 29 Galle Face Terrace, Colombo 3, Sri Lanka, Tel: 94 11 2 307 179 Sri Lanka Airports Investment Development Program Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Ministry of Ports and Aviation of Sri Lanka for an Airport Investment Development Program.  This technical assistance will enable the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to develop a comprehensive capital investment program for the country’s civil aviation infrastructure.  

Sri Lanka, an island nation, is dependent on air and sea traffic for trade and tourism.  The development and expansion of the country's airports is a vital part of the future growth of the country as a tourist center and potential transportation hub for the region.  There are a number of proposals under consideration, from upgrading existing airports to building greenfield airports in the south to converting a small airfield in Colombo to a regional and domestic airport.  The GOSL is seeking to develop the airports through public private partnerships or other similar arrangements, which will attract foreign capital.  However, without a policy and plan for the development of the aviation infrastructure, investors will be reluctant to move forward due to the uncertainty of the long-term goals of the government.  The Technical Assistance is intended to assist the GOSL in discerning the economic, financial, and technical viability of: a) making a near-term capital investment decision to expand the existing international runway and/or creating a second runway at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIG); and b) further upgrading airside and groundside infrastructure of BIA and upgrading and developing existing and Greenfield airport.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $422,800 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon Local Time, April 21, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Chester Keller, (803)806-1537
<DESC>(Synopsis) The South Carolina Army National Guard (SCARNG) has a requirement to procure a commercially-available Automatic Flight Following System (AFFS). The requirement includes delivery of the AFFS, installing it on Army aircraft and ground vehicles,  integrating it with existing aircraft systems such as the Vibration Monitoring System (VMS), and operation, testing   and evaluation of the AFFS as installed.  The requirement also includes training of National Guard personnel in the installation, maintenance and oper ation of the AFFS and its associated equipment.      This equipment and these tasks are needed to provide logistical support for a Pilot Project System that can demonstrate capabilities in the following operational exercises: * Real-time acquisition and monitoring of aircraft mechanical (vibration) performance  while in flight;  * Monitoring of  aircraft and ground vehicles during military training exercises;  * Multi-agency (ARNG, DHS, State public safety) training exercises for national or regional disasters. The System must have been integrated with an aircrafts vibration monitoring and health and unit monitoring systems (VMS and HUMS, respectively) and have been successfully flight tested by the US military. A proposed system must be currently operational on  military helicopters. The aircraft systems must have demonstrated the capability to send aircraft mechanical (HUMS) data messages every 5 seconds continuously while in flight.  1.    The proposed system shall be capable of two-way (transmit/receive) text messaging.  2.    The proposed systems mobile equipment shall consist of the CP-2 family of mobile satellite transceivers, small patch antennas, and Control/Display Units.  3.    For enhanced communications security (low probability of interception/detection (LPI/LPD)), the mobile satellite transceiver shall transmit Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) with a bandwidth of at least 2 MHz, in order to minimize Power Spectral  Density. The system shall not require that the entire bandwidth be dedicated exclusively to the proposed system. The nominal transmit duration for a location report shall be less than 30 milliseconds. Transmissions shall be asynchronous transmit-on-demand .  4.    The system shall be FAA-licensed and operating in the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) frequency bands.  5.    The proposed aircraft equipment shall have airworthiness approval for helicopter operations from either the FAA or the US military.  6.    The proposed system shall use CommTrack application software for its operations work Stations at McEntire ANG, NGB, Pine Ridge, and other operational locations.  7.    Timeliness of reports is imperative; i.e., the delays (and variation in delays) in reporting must be minimized. The proposed system shall have a communications latency of less than five (5) seconds, regardless of system demand or capacity. The system  shall have demonstrated the operational capability to provide asset location (latitude, longitude, altitude) and ground speed every five (5) seconds with minimal latency.  8.    This multi-agency exercise is planned to include the Customs & Border Protection Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC) at a location to be determined (TBD). The proposed system must be fully integrated and operational with the C&BP AMOC center. In addition, this exercise is intended to demonstrate the interoperability of the proposed Network Operations Center to seamlessly integrate data communications from various terrestrial and satellite communication networks in a manner that is transparent to t he user. This interoperability will also demonstrate the proposed systems ability to maintain the integrity of communications security while supporting multi-agency interoperability.  Offerors shall submit three copies of their technical and price proposals along with brochures and commercial price lists and Past Performance information with full description of sales with cont act points of reference over the past three years.  Delivery of AFFS is 60 days after contract award, FOB Destination (McEntire ANG Base, Eastover SC 29044).  The services (installation, integration, operation, testing and evaluation, training of Governmen t personnel) shall be provided for a full calendar year after contract award.  The services component of the contract will have four option years.  The services may be required at Huntsville, AL; Washington, DC; March ARB, CA; and other locations, in addit ion to McEntire ANG Base.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government. Evaluation and selection of Contractor will be based on the following selection criteria, which are listed in order of importance.  (1) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, (s ub-factor relevant experience with similar contracts, particularly those for systems monitoring).  Past performance includes performance of the proposed AFFS equipment   Past performance information must clearly demonstrate that the proposed AFFS equipment  has the above described characteristics and capabilities, and that it performs reliably.  (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, (sub-factor, management staff and support staff).  (3) Price- the Government will e valuate offers for award purposes by including the price of the option years in the total price for the requirement.  (This evaluation does not obligate the Government to exercise the options.)  Past performance and Technical when combined are significantl y more important than price, subject to the funding range between $750K and $1.5M for the AFFS equipment, and between $750K and $1.7M for the services for the base year.  Offerors must demonstrate their financial capacity to perform.  To do so, offerors mu st submit a letter from their Financial Institution. The NAICS code for the acquisition is 334511.

<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This Federal Business Opportunities, (FedBizOpps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed award of a follow-on task order through Government Services Administration (GSA) contract GS23F0246L to The Boeing Company.  ISRSG/PK intends to award a contract to provide for the Multimedia Message Manager (M3) software maintenance.<br> <br> The task order will have a period of performance of two years from date of award. <br> <br> The task order ceiling will be in the amount of $9,825,000. <br> <br> M3 software maintenance includes all labor, material, equipment and services to perform the following software engineering tasks: 1) Install M3 world wide (including hardware, software, network, CSP/AUTODIN connectivity, DA/CP-XP/DMS connectivity, etc.) at new and existing customer sites. 2) Provide M3 training for System Administrators (SA), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), Profile Administrators (PA), Operators and Users at new and existing customer sites. 3) Support M3 Security Accreditation Testing (SAT) at new customer sites. 4) Transition old message traffic to M3 at new customer sites. 5) Create initial M3 profile set and accounts at new customer sites. 6) Implement new functional enhancements and bug fixes in M3 for new version releases as required. 7) Update all M3 documentation for new version releases as required. 8) Upgrade existing customer sites to latest M3 version releases with little or no disruption of operational services. 9) Maintain and troubleshoot the current M3 software and documentation baseline as required. 10) Operate and manage the M3 8x5 Code 2 help desk. 11) Operate and manage the M3 24x7 Code 1 help desk.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6-302-1 entitled "Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:" Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-A9(1).  A Sources Sought was released to industry on 13 May 2005 with responses required to be submitted by 28 May 2005.  Based on the responses to this Sources Sought, the Government considers that an award to any source other than The Boeing Company would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in filling the Government's requirements.  Current M3 functionality must continue to maintain continuity of vital message handling services supporting national-level intelligence requirements. <br> The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation for the M3 would incur substantial duplication of costs in relation to technical and configuration knowledge of the M3, which would not be recovered through competition as well as the loss of critical uninterrupted software maintenance. <br> <br> Please direct any questions regarding this Notice to Patricia J. Forest, Contracting Officer, 781-266-1048.  The following Clause applies to this contract action. <br> <br> AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101  OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) <br> <br> (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br> <br> (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). <br> <br> (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [ESC Director, Commander' s Staff, Tel. (781) 377-5106, ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. <br> (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br> (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br> (End of clause) <br>  See Note 26.

<DESC>The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Joint Program Office, Air to Ground Munition System Wing, (AGMSW)/DASG, Eglin AFB, Florida, intends to issue a contract or contract modification to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company, for integrating onto the F/A-18 aircraft (but not limited to F/A-18) a non-developmental laser seeker kit that is field-installable on a MK-82 warhead integrated with a standard JDAM GBU-38 tail kit.  This effort is in response to the warfighters’ urgent need for an affordable, precision dual-mode (GPS/INS and laser) JDAM capability to enhance operational performance and mission flexibility when GPS target coordinates are not available.  This effort includes integration of the laser-modified JDAM (Laser JDAM) on the F/A-18 and integration-related support, procurement of test assets through completion of Laser JDAM integration and production estimated through FY10.  This effort is anticipated to be awarded under a single contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee for integration and testing support, and Firm Fixed Price production options of the laser seeker kit.  The Boeing Company is the current JDAM prime contractor, and has sole responsibility for design and warranty of the JDAM weapon system.  Boeing is not required to furnish a technical data package to the Systems Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available.  The scope of this effort shall include procurement of the test and integration hardware/software such as: separation, guided, and instrumented test vehicles, laser kits, telemetry kits, tooling and factory test equipment, weapon trainers, laser kit containers, logistics support and analysis, together with technical support for the actual planning, conduct, analysis and documentation of the Government evaluation effort and resolution of resulting issues.  Direct all questions and routine communication concerning this acquisition to Ms. Sallye Belton, (850) 882- 3525 ext 3070.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns relating to this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager previously identified.  For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman,  Mr. Dennis Love at (850) 882-0312, AAC/XP, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495.

<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Contracting Officer 7037871263     Sharon.Teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), U. S. Department of the Interior.  It is the Government's intent, based on the information received as a result of this notice, to make an award as a 100% small business set-aside.   The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.   All interested parties must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541990: All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.  The Small Business Association's size standard for this NAICS Code is the not to exceed amount of $6.5 million in average annual receipts.  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Based on the review of the responses to the Request for Information, the MMS reserves the right to issue a small business set aside, or full and open, competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR 15.202.  However, please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition, based on the review of the responses to the Request for Information.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  Pursuant to FAR 52.219014, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  In order to compete under this acquisition, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities statement as specified herein.  Furthermore, the Capabilities Statement must certify qualification under the NAICS code specified herein.  Offerors who do not qualify as a small business shall not be considered further and will be rejected.  Further instructions regarding submission of Capabilities Statements are contained herein.  Following a review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements received from this announcement, a list of those deemed qualified to perform the work and which qualify under the NAICS Code 541990 will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal.  The Government anticipates a combination firm fixed price order and time and materials contract for this effort.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:   The purpose of the proposed effort is for the preparation of a programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP).  With the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct), the Minerals Management Service (MMS) was given responsibility for the CIAP.  The purpose of the CIAP is to improve coastal environments through funding of projects as defined in the EPAct to the states of Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and coastal localities nearest to where the activities occur.  Each affected state will submit a plan for review by MMS.  The projects identified in the plans must be used for one or more of five purposes defined in section 384 and must be in accordance with all Federal laws, including complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  To meet these requirements, MMS is preparing a programmatic EA.  The CIAP was previously administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Department of Commerce in 2001.  The primary objectives of the programmatic EA will be to evaluate the impacts of implementing the program, establish criteria for making NEPA determinations for each project, and develop a checklist to be used by the states to determine compliance with Federal laws.    SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on the organization's familiarity and understanding of the National Environmental Policy Act and preparation of programmatic Environmental Assessments, their experience in the type of work proposed, demonstrated ability to do the work, and an understanding of the directed missions of the MMS, as well as the company's prior experience in work of similar scope to this project and complexity and timely delivery of final products.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Capability Statements will be evaluated on the basis of: (1) understanding of effort and objectives; (2) experience and expertise of key technical personnel, (3) degree of comparability of past projects to the current project. Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 2:00 p.m. E.T. on March 24, 2006.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of Sharon Teger, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170.   Questions regarding this Request for Information should be submitted via email to sharon.teger@mms.gov.

The following are required for this work: a) rearing of chinook and coho salmon on specified rations to control growth rate in different groups of experimental fish, b) collection of tissues and plasma from experimental fish, c) measurement of plasma and pituitary gonadotropins, plasma sex steroids, and IGF I by radioimmunossay, d) measurement of ovarian gene transcripts  (gonadotropin and growth hormone receptors, IGF I and IGF II, steroid acute regulatory protein) from experimental fish by real time PCR, e) suppression subtraction hybridization cloning of ovarian genes, f) computer image analysis of gonad development from histological sections of gonads from experimental fish, g) ultrasound to identify maturing fish, and h) statistical analyses and interpretation of data collected from experimental fish.  All analyses and fish rearing will be conducted at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

2) Assist with laboratory, behavioral and field  assessments of olfactory imprinting by sockeye and Chinook salmon. To determine the critical period(s) for imprinting, juvenile salmon are being exposed to known odorants at key developmental stages and are being tested subsequently for development of long-term memories of these odorants.  Results of these experiments will be important to determine the critical periods for imprinting for the offspring of captively-reared fish destined for release into natal rivers or lakes. The following are required for this work: a) maintain odor exposure equipment and odorants, b) conduct routine sampling of fish for tissue and physiological assays to assess smolting and imprinting, c) assist with behavioral assessments of imprinting in experimental stream channel, d) conduct electro-olfactogram (EOG) assessments of imprinted sockeye salmon and e) assist with molecular assessments of imprinting f) assist with carcass and redd surveys to assess imprinting and homing success of Chinook salmon.

3) Assist with collecting biological information and conducting genetic and phenotypic analyses of inbreeding-study families of University of Washington stock Chinook salmon. Assistance is required to capture experimental adult fish as they return to the Portage Bay hatchery and retrieve biological data, coded-wire tag information, and genetic samples from them.  Assistance with establishing experimentally inbred families and control families, followed by periodic sampling of juvenile study fish for size and growth, and with relating this information to family and cross information is also required.  Modest assistance in conducting genetic analyses of the family data for estimation of inbreeding coefficients and for maintaining pedigree records for the study is required.

Deliverables will be in the form of data collected from experiments and summarized in a FY07 annual report.  The report shall be delivered to the COTR by September 30, 2007.

<DESC>This is ONLY a request for information and NOT a solicitation.

INTRODUCTION:

The Government is interested in obtaining more information concerning Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at our Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF).  To respond to this request, please review the Statement of Objectives (SOO).  Based on the SOO, the Government is requesting information from Industry to aid in determining the key fields and factors to meet the desired requirements.  This information will assist the Government in formulating an acquisition strategy and associated timeline for development that is planned to begin in or around the end of FY06.  

Statement of Objectives

1.0  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.

1.1  Introduction. This Statement of Objectives (SOO) defines the development and integration of a Radar Target Generator (RTG) for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF), Detachment 2, 28th Test Squadron, Tyndall AFB, Florida.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.

1.2  Background.  The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet. The absence of an APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testing.

2.0  CONTRACT OBJECTIVES.

2.1  Technical Requirements.  The contractor shall design, construct, deliver, and integrate an APG-63(V)1 / APG-70 RTG with the following capabilities:

- Programmable range and velocity by using time delay and doppler shift of the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar signals for all operating modes

- Selectable modes including radar receiver-injected and free-space farfield horn modes

- Generate a minimum of four in-beam, three-dimensional maneuvering targets in receiver injected mode and and a minimum of four in-beam, non-maneuvering targets in horn mode

- Programmable aircraft type to include jet engine modulation (JEM) and aspect-dependent radar cross-section (RCS)

- Realistic clutter introduction into the signal generation

- Ownship altitude, airspeed, and heading maneuvers including generated MIL-STD 1553 inertial navigation system (INS) and embedded INS and GPS (EGI) inputs 

- 360-degree antenna beam shaping for monopulse track capability and jamming assessment

- Capture of real-time Time Space Position Information (TSPI) for all targets through an interface with an IRIG-B time system

- User interface including a PC workstation which shall have a removable hard drive capability with a total of two removable hard drives

- Capability to mix jamming signals into generated target returns

- Capability to monitor the status of radar interface signals (see list of desired variables)

- The RTS design shall be flexible enough to permit free-space radiation of the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 with and without the utilization of the RTS.

- Hardware/software interface which complies with existing IATF avionics (site survey opportunity available)

2.2  Documentation.  The contractor shall provide the operation and maintenance documentation for the complete RTS after completion of the integration in both paper and searchable electronic format.

2.3  Integration.  The contractor shall perform all integration and acceptance testing of the RTS at the IATF to ensure operational capability in all areas.  In addition, the contractor shall develop and demonstrate an Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) to demonstrate all features.

2.4  Applicable Documents.  

- F-15 Eagle Security Classification Guide

3.0  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT.

3.1  Project Management.  The contractor shall designate a project director who shall be responsible for the control and coordination of all work performed on this contract.  The contractor shall provide the project manager’s name, in writing, to the Contracting Officer (CO) and the IATF within 14 days after issuance of contract.

3.2  Contracting Officer.  The CO for this contract is from the 325th CONS/LGCBB.  

3.3  Information Release.  The contractor shall not release any information to any person, government agency, or contractor concerning the programs under this contract without the approval of the CO.

3.4  Security Clearances.  The contractor shall comply with the F-15 Security Classification Guide in effect at the time this contract is accepted for requirements in handling, dissemination, and storage of any classified material developed under this purchase order.  The minimum level of security clearance required to work on the integration of the equipment at the IATF is SECRET / NOFORN.  

3.5  Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  The hardware supplied by the IATF as GFE shall consist of the APG-63(V)1 radar and APG-70 Operational Test and Evaluation Spread Bench (OTESB).

3.6  Reviews.  The contractor shall monitor performance of this contract and provide monthly updates to the CO detailing the program status.  The contractor shall hold program reviews at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida as necessary, throughout the task duration.  The contractor and Government shall mutually agree upon the specific dates and times for these reviews.

3.7  Acceptance Test.  Following completion of the RTS integration, the contractor shall perform an acceptance test procedure, which demonstrates all features of the RTS in its final form, as integrated into the IATF.

3.8  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for this contract will be determined when the request for proposal is issued.  Performance will be measured through monthly status updates and periodic reviews by the Government as specified in paragraph 3.6.

3.9.  Alterations.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract.  Changes to the terms and conditions and scope of this can only be made by a warranted contracting officer upon mutual agreement between the government and contractor.

<DESC>Market Survey: Sources are sought that can provide or equal products for brand name components as described below.  The New York District intends to solicit and award one-construction project for Fort Drum, New York, entitled Airfield Vehicle Supp ort Facility. The project itself will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation. However, the project may potentially include a brand name component.  This notification serves three purposes: 1) To notify potential offerors of the Government s intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project; (2) To identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and; and (3) Notification of the Governments intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name O nly, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monaco system is embedded in the Construction projects, which projects will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the projects requiring the Monaco system is sole source if no sources are able to provide a  compatible system. In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.   The synopsis is for planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is the onl y document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the government's intent.  A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or systems(s) in the ev ent an or equal product is not submitted for consideration.  In such instances the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project that will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring brand name component s will be sole source if no sources are able to prove an or equal product.  Supplies will be providing the brand name component to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.  In the e vent no or equals exist, the brand name justifications will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.  Summary of Requirement: the project includes Brand Name only equipment for building fire alarm radio transceivers manufactured by Mon aco Enterprises. These projects with their many state-of-the-art building components require reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire reporting system is the best  and the most economical alternative to be compatible with the existing system.  Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  Only one model has been determined to be acceptable, and the appropriate model will be selected per building requirements.  The Monaco Enterprises Inc. BTX-F Building Transceiver is the one piece of equipment best suited to meet the needs of Fort Drum.  The BTX-F Fire Alarm Building Transceiver is functionally designed for specific Government fire de partment operations. Monaco Enterprise Inc. provides 24/7 technical support and in-service training of Installation personnel for operation and maintenance inclusive. It is paramount that this system be carefully coordinated to maintain overall system inte grity and capabilities. The required features of the BTX-F Fire Alarm Building Transceiver are as follows: Hardwire line or narrowband radio communication with any of the D-21 Fire Management System, Narrowband radio is FCC certified for narrowband operati on and meets the requirements of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Frequency Management , Radio communication with the D-21,  Provides audio and fire alarm overrides for m ass notification per UFC and NFPA,  Provides automatic and manual control of local or remote devices such as turning on pumps based on timed events, input from a fire alarm control panel, or manually activated from the D-21, Provides eight relay driver outputs and four supervised zone inputs, Eight onboard open-collector relay driver outputs can connect to the BTX-F relay board or to relay coils that remotely con trol equipment such as pump activation inputs, HVAC dampers, lighting, door openers, runway barriers, and gates. These outputs can also drive remote annunciator LEDs with the following features:  Four supervised fire zone inputs for connection to fire dete ction and monitoring devices located within 15 feet of the BTX-F; these are supervised for open (trouble), short (alarm), single-ground fault, and double-ground fault conditions, Four zone LEDs (one for each zone) reflect the condition of the zones: troubl e, alarm, or normal, Status LEDs reflect the status of the BTX-F: general alarm, general trouble, system fault, in-communication, carrier detect, transmit, primary power, battery boost charge, and battery float charge, Supports up to 31 zone expansion back planes into which fire and audio expansion cards can be plugged.  Each zone expansion card provides four zone inputs and eight relay outputs for connection to local or remotely located devices. Each expansion card has five LEDs: the PWR LED indicates power  is being supplied to the card; the remaining four LEDs indicate the status of the four zone inputs. Each BTX-F can support up to 252 zones and 504 relay outputs with 62 expansion cards installed.  One selectable RS-422/RS-485 port for communication with p eripheral equipment or connection to a local access controller. An alternative use of this port is hardwire connection to multiple BTX-F units connected together for communication with the D-21.  	Two full-duplex RS-232 ports used to program the BTX-F via connection to a laptop computer or for connection to peripheral equipment that does not have a RS-422 port/RS-485 port. 115 or 230 Vac power monitored with automatic switchover to backup battery power that provides standby power; the number of hours depend s on the battery. 	Self test, stuck transmitter disconnect, reset, acknowledge, and battery reconnect switches with the following features: Local audible alert, Real-time clock and calendar, 	1/2 Mb of program memory, 1/2 Mb of non-volatile data storage, 	 Fits in a variety of enclosures; the enclosure size depends upon how many expansion cards are needed.  Factory Mutual approved.

<DESC>ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY, BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY, LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY, OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY AND PACIFIC NORTHWEST NATIONAL LABORATORY ANNOUNCE THE INTENT TO APPLY TO DEVELOP USER FACILITY TO PRODUCE AND CHARACTERIZE MICROBIAL PROTEINS AND MOLECULAR TAGS


Announcement:     The Protein Science Consortium (PSC) is a cooperative association of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  ANL is a government-owned/contractor operated (GOCO) facility managed by the University of Chicago, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  BNL, ORNL and PNNL are government owned/contractor operated (GOCO) facilities managed by Battelle.  LANL is a national security laboratory managed as government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO), federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). As the five national laboratories are each federally funded research and development centers, each laboratory and the PSC is bound by fairness of opportunity requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs). 
The Genome to Life program (GTL) in the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (OBER) of the Office of Science, U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released a draft RFP for a GTL Facility for the Production and Characterization of Protein and Molecular Tag, Funding Opportunity No. 
DE-PN02-06ER64154 
https://e-center.doe.gov/iips/faopor.nsf/UNID/036C90C51E5B565685257111007D1111/$file/GTL+PN0206ER64154+GrantsGov+Feb+10+Amd+001.pdf 


The Facility for the Production and Characterization of Proteins and Molecular Tags, will surmount a principal roadblock to whole-system analysis of biomolecular networks that is the foundation for the entire GTL program by implementing high-throughput production and characterization of microbial proteins. This Facility will bring together, for the first time, comprehensive technologies to mass-produce and characterize microbial proteins directly from sequence data and to generate specific 'capture and labeling' affinity reagents for each protein. The availability of these characterized proteins and "tags" to capture, identify, and track them in living systems will provide a crucial resource for researchers. This will enable development of methods to determine how and under which condition these proteins and protein complexes function in cellular processes. The development of this facility will require additional research to develop the core technologies that will underpin the capabilities of the Facility including the development of technologies for high-throughput production of proteins and their biophysical characterization, and for the production of molecular tags to identify individual proteins and to characterize multi-protein complexes in microbial cells. Production and characterization technologies should be scalable, economic, and sufficiently robust to work in a production environment. At least 50% of all proteins are anticipated to pose significant problems for any current production method. Consequently, a significant component of this project will be research into new methods of protein production. Improved techniques are also needed to predict from genome sequence what production and purification approaches are most likely to succeed with each protein. Thus, informatics also is an integral component. Algorithms based on data from successful and failed protein expressions are expected to substantially inform and improve future protein production efficiency. The Facility will produce, characterize, and make available a wide range of microbial proteins from both cultivated and uncultivated microbes for use by the scientific community in their individual research projects. Ready availability of these resources will free the nation's scientists to apply their energies to understanding these microbes, a major step toward using microbial capabilities.

For parties interested in supporting and/or working with the PSC on the proposed user facility for the Production and Characterization of Proteins and Molecular Tags, please respond in writing to the PSC byApril 4, 2006 addressing each of the items listed below.     PSC will respond back by April 11, 2006.
1.       Name, location(s) and descriptions including 
a.       Recent annual report or other overview of your organization and the team that you are proposing in response to the draft RFP

The IBDB workflow application will use electronically available contract, timekeeping, and other resource-use data to assist with the processing of commitments, obligations, accruals, payments, and reporting.  Contract support is required to design, develop, and implement an Enable Java interface that will be used to record financial transactions into the FFIS.

<DESC>This is a combined/synopsis for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only request; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The associated National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 112990 - All Other Animal Production and the business size is 500 employees.  The Government intends to issue a contract for the Air Force Research Laboratory, Brooks City-Base, TX.  The request is for VENDOR STATUS/REQUIREMENT: 1. USDA licensed ANIMAL PHYSICAL and HEALTH STATUS REQUIREMENTS: 1. Live Cynomologus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) are required for research programs conducted by the U.S. Army Medical Research Detachment (USAMRD). The animals of this specific requisition will be used on an IACUC approved animal use protocol investigating treatments for laser eye injury. Specific physical and health status requirements must be met for animals to be involved in the research program. The monkeys should be: a) Males b) experimentally naïve, c) 2.4 – 4.0 kg, d) 18 30 months of age (prefer animals more than 24 months of age), e) herpes B, SIV, SRV, STLV1 antibody negative, PCR/SRV l and 2 negative, f) vaccinated for Hepatitis "A" and measles, g) prophylactic treatment with deworming medications such as Ivermec and Albendazole. h) Tuberculosis negative. It is fairly important that the monkeys be close in age and body size for our experiments so the size of the eye is approximately the same for each animal. Additionally they must have complete clinical histories, results of all previous physical exams (including body weights and fecal parasite egg count) and treatment records.  TECHNICAL PRE-SELECTION SCREENING
Prior to purchase (and transport to Brooks City-Base, TX) individual animals must have ocular and physical examinations conducted by USAMRD personnel.  This requirement is to ensure selected animals meet specific ocular criteria and orbital morphology that is necessary in the animals to be used in this protocol.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The following clause applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text:

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
Number Note 1 applies.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-06-R-DB04, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-08 and DFARS Change Notice 20060223. The associated small business size standard is 334511 and 750 employees. Specifications:  CLIN 0001:  Quantity of 64 omni-directional hydrophones that are to be used as receiver elements in a 2-dimensional underwater acoustic array (Billboard Array). The goal is to obtain hydrophones that are nearly identical in performance, and that achieve a minimum sensitivity, bandwidth, and omni-directionality. A secondary but still very important goal is that the hydrophones be constructed in such a way that they can be mounted into a structural frame that NRL is building. Initially this frame will be a spherical lattice of thin rods with mounts for the hydrophones at the vertices. The mounts will firmly hold the preamplifier housings in places, with the sensitive receiving elements projecting outwards from the sphere. These hydrophones are to be high-fidelity units that are fairly small and lightweight. (Details of the physical requirements are given below.) Since we sometimes need to use long lengths of cable on these hydrophones (initially up to 100 meters, but this will later be extended to several hundred meters), the hydrophones must have a built-in signal preamplifier at the receiver element, and include a high pass filter to prevent saturation from the effects of surface waves. Other considerations include the size and weight of the hydrophone and preamplifier housing, the size of the underwater cable, and the physical robustness of the entire assembly. Usable Frequency Range shall be 15Hz to 480 kHz or higher. Sensitivity:  Minus 186 dB re 1V/microPa or better over the usable frequency range, Must not vary by more than plus or minus 3 dB over this usable frequency range, Must not vary by more than plus or minus 2 dB in the frequency range 15 Hz to 200 kHz. and Each hydrophone should come with an individual calibration chart showing its Receiving Sensitivity over its usable frequency range. Directivity: Horizontal (radial x-y plane); Omni-directional to plus or minus 2 dB or less below 100 kHz, and Omni-directional to plus or minus 3 dB or less at 100–300 kHz, Vertical (axial x-z plane); Over 270 Degrees, plus or minus 2 dB or less at 100 kHz and Over 270 Degrees, plus or minus 3 dB or less at 100–300 kHz. Preamplifier: Gain: Fixed, in the range 25 to 30 dB, DC Supply: 12 to 24 V. (Supply will be furnished by NRL.)Power Consumption: 50 mW or less. Max. cable length drive capability: 1000 meters or more.
Hi-pass filtering: 15Hz, 3dB/Octave roll-off or better. And Noise: Above 1 kHz, equivalent spectral noise pressure level must be 45 dB re 1V/microPa or less. Below 1 kHz, equivalent spectral noise pressure level must be below Seastate Zero level. (By this, we mean lower than 45 dB re 1V/microPa at 1 kHz, rising to 75 dB re 1V/microPa down at 10 Hz.). Calibration: Provision must be made to be able to provide a calibration signal to the preamplifier down the cable, for the purpose of checking the correct operation of the unit. Operating Conditions (continuous): Minus 2 Degrees C or lower to 50 Degrees C or higher and Depths of 900 meters or greater. The units will be subjected to oceanic salt water environments for periods of weeks at a time. Physical: The cables must be detachable from the body of the hydrophone/preamplifier units. This must be achieved through any of a number of industry standard watertight connectors that are readily available commercially, and can easily maintain a watertight connection down to depths of 900 meters. Typically these connectors push together to achieve an electrical connection, and then an outer screw mechanism is engaged to compress an o-ring, thus achieving a physically secure link that is also watertight. NRL requires a commonly available connector of this type on the units being purchased here. The other end of the cables will be pig-tails (no termination). The hydrophone, preamplifier housing, and connector (that will mate to the cable) must all form a single, rigid unit. In other words, once the preamplifier housing is firmly held in one position, there can be no relative motion of either the hydrophone receiving element (the ceramic) or the watertight connector. The cables and connectors must be at least 7 conductor, one being for ground, two for signals (since the preamplifier is differential), one for DC power supply, one for cable shield, one for sending a calibration signal to the preamplifier, and at least one as a spare. The cable should include a 500lbs strain relief, and be water blocked with a material that can withstand a salt water environment, such as polyurethane. The cable OD should be around 1cm. (Smaller cables are acceptable, but any larger than 1.1cm diameter is unacceptable.) The preamplifier housing must be cylindrical in shape, with the cylindrical axis aligned with the axis of acoustical symmetry. This housing must be rigidly constructed of a metal that will be resistant to corrosion from salt water (for example, stainless steel or aluminum bronze). Its outer diameter must not exceed 4 cm (smaller would be preferable), and its length must be at least than 5cm but no longer than 15cm (not including the connector on the rear of the unit). The tip of the receiving element (the ceramic) must extend away from the body of the preamplifier housing by 10cm (plus or minus 1 cm), and must be protect by a chloroprene rubber skin or some other material that will be resistant to salt water environments while still being acoustically transparent. A smaller size to the active element is preferable, and together with its protective skin should have a diameter of no more than 1.5 cm (smaller would be preferable).	Each hydrophone/preamplifier integral unit, when detached from the cable in air, must weigh no more than 1.5 lbs.  Delivery and acceptance is at NRL, Washington, D.C. 20375, FOB Destination. The contractor shall deliver the spectrometer no later than sixty (60) days after contract award. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  The provision at FAR 52.212-2,Evaluation--Commercial Items is incorporated. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and is being made in accordance with the test program for commercial items as authorized in Far Part 13.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  

This solicitation No., RFQ-NCI-60047-NG, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-08 (January 2006).  

The North American Industry Classification Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

STATEMENT OF WORK: Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with elevated risk of several internal cancers, and in particular, bladder cancer.  The observation that bladder cancer risk is elevated subsequent to arsenic ingestion comes from studies in several populations worldwide, including Southwest Taiwan, Northeast Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Cordoba Province of Argentina.  These populations historically have been exposed to very high levels of arsenic in their drinking water, and dramatic risk elevations are observed, with relative risks ranging from 3 or 4 to 15, compared to populations with low levels of arsenic in their drinking water.  Exposures in these regions of the world ranged between 200 ug/L to 1500 ug/L.  
	
The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  Reasons for this elevation are poorly understood.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The main objective is to determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall:	

1	Analyze samples for the presence and concentration of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and Zinc (Zn) using nuclear activation analysis (NAA).  

2	Prepare all samples as necessary (routine analysis) prior to NAA analysis.  

3	Contractor shall specify whether cleaning of samples prior to analysis is included in the proposal.  If cleaning is included in the proposal, the cost shall be identified as a separately priced line item. 

4	In the case-control study, toenail samples were collected from 2,545 participants.  The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample analyses will be required.  In addition, 10% (255 samples) randomly selected samples of adequate size will be split and blindly submitted for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  Thus the maximum number of analyses, including QA samples will be 2,800.  All analyses must be completed, with results submitted, no later than eight (8) months after the start date of this contract.  Higher throughput, which would permit completion of analyses no later than six (6) months after contract initiation, will be to the advantage of the contracting laboratory.

The contractor shall provide a detailed description of quality control/quality assurance procedures that are used for preparation and analysis of blanks and standardized samples.  

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 

1	The Contractor shall electronically communicate results of all analyses, including quality control information, to the NCI Project Officer on a weekly basis, using an Excel format to be provided by NCI. Problems or delays relating to any aspect of these analyses shall be reported to the NCI Project Officer as soon as noted by the contractor. 

2	Contractor shall provide a summary report of progress, study management, problems, and their resolution, to NCI on a monthly basis, to commence the beginning of the first month after samples have been received by the contractor.  

3	The report shall include, but not be limited to: Counts of the numbers of samples received, analyzed, and whose results were reported in the monthly reporting period, as well as totals to date.  
		
4	The Contractor shall provide a final report to NCI at the conclusion of all analyses which shall include summaries of these same data.  

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: NCI will provide to the contractor toenail samples collected from study subjects in the period 2002-2005.  If cleaning of samples is not included in an offeror’s proposal, this will be done by the Government prior to shipment.   In addition to original samples, an additional 10% of the samples will be blinded replicates, indistinguishable from the original samples.  These blinded replicates will be submitted to the contractor for quality control purposes.

Samples will be shipped to the contractor from NCI's sample repository in batches to be determined by consultation and agreement between NCI and the contractor, and at a frequency to be determined in like manner.   Prior to shipment of samples from the NCI repository to the contractor, the batch size used in analysis will be communicated to NCI to permit the rational organization of QA samples.   The weight of each sample shipped from NCI shall be no less than 10 mg. 

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  Within two weeks of submission of data to NCI, the Project Officer will review the data submitted to NCI by the contractor, and inform the contractor of any anomalies found and/or corrective action required

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 1, 2006 – January 31, 2007.  NOTE:  Offerors may propose a shorter delivery schedule and will be given additional technical points if this shorter delivery schedule is proposed.

Selection Factors:

qualifications based on information obtained through the

clearly identify how well the applicant meets the minimum and 
desired qualifications of this position.  Interviews, if

2.  Information collected from reference checks.  References 
will only be verified for those applicants determined to have a

3.  Results of a cost assessment.  The cost assessment will 
determine the total cost (salary plus benefits and allowances) 
of the applicant for the complete term of the contract (base 
period plus any option years).

In determining best value, paramount consideration shall be 
given to technical merit (applicant qualifications and reference 
checks) rather than to cost.  In cases where applicants are 
determined to be essentially equal, then cost may become the 
determining factor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Part 12.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-06-Q-30008 is being  assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees. This synopsis/solicitation is issued for the overhaul of  Cooling Turbines, NIIN 01-438-5697, Part Number 203720-1, quantity of 2. All items are to be overhauled in accordance with Air Force Technical Order 15A3-2-40-4 (latest revision). The Coast Guard does not maintain nor distribute Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping reparables which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair".  Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.  Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition.  Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive, will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.  Desired delivery to commence within 30 days after receipt of material. Required delivery is 30 April, 2006.

Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material:  popcorn, shredded paper, styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging.  The contractor shall review all manufacturers' service bulletins, service information letters and equipment revisions for applicability against the reworked item's part number.

As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-75, insert the following clause: 
PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This Amendment is issued to answer questions in response to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation N00421-06-T-0083.
 
QUESTIONS & ANSWERS: 1. Is there a desired form factor for the new architecture?  We request insight to the system being replaced, for where and how the units are currently deployed for form factor awareness. This is especially critical for the shipboard deployments to attempt to fit in current weight and balance configurations.  Insight to the shore based form and space factors (i.e. 19 inch racks, amount of "U" space, power feeds etc...) would be helpful as well.   RESPONSE:  For shore facility installations, the dimensions of the DVLCE (recording system without the environmental rack) are stated in section 3.2 of the SOW. If, by the term "form factor", you are referring to rack units, the system that is being replaced was not designed in accordance with a rack unit or "U" standard.  If, by the term "form factor" you are referring to commercial ATX/mATX/BTX/mBTX standards, these do not apply as this system architecture will be based upon a single board computer and passive backplane design. Per paragraph 3.3.1 in the SOW, the host cabinet shall have standard 19-inch rack configuration.    For shipboard installations, the dimensions of the DVLRS (recording system housed in the environment rack) are stated in section 3.3 of the SOW.  If, by the term "form factor", you are referring to rack units, the system that is being replaced was not designed in accordance with a rack unit or "U" standard.  If, by the term "form factor" you are referring to commercial ATX/mATX/BTX/mBTX standards, these do not apply as this system architecture will be based upon a single board computer and passive backplane design.  Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the SOW provide amplifying information on the dimensions requirements. The DVLRS is to be a next-generation follow-on recorder system and is not intended to replace existing recorders.  It is however form and fit compatible with existing Recorder-Reproducer systems as follows:  RD-674A/UNH Recorder-Reproducer / RD-674B/UNH Recorder-Reproducer.  The majority of these recorders are deployed on the following ship classes:  DDG-51 Arliegh Burke and CG-47 Ticonderoga.

2.   Per SOW paragraphs 3.12.1.9 and 3.12.1.10, and 3.12.1.11, the radar video interface capabilities of the DVLRS were intended to be fixed price options.  If installed, the requirements are as follows:   2a.  How many radar working positions have to be recorded?  RESPONSE: The requirement is to passively tap one radar system video feed (i.e. TPX-42) in-line before it reaches the display console(s).  2b. Will the replay be done on a separate position or on the radar working position where the recording has been made?   RESPONSE:  The replay will originate from the DVLRS and be distributed to any one of the available display consoles. 2c. How many physical radar lines (or radar plugs) are there in the project?   RESPONSE:  One radar line.  2d. What is the radar protocol format used in RS422?   RESPONSE:   Per SOW paragraph 3.13.1.3, the required protocols are CD2 and HDLC.   3. The due date timing (March 22nd) of this RFP, for a critical USN recording system, of this magnitude appears to be condensed. Is there any operational timing issue that is driving the submission suspense?  RESPONSE:  The proposal due date of 22 March 2006, will provide ample time for the Technical Team to conduct First Article Testing.  Additionally, the open period is in accordance with FAR Part 12 regulations for procurement of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items.
