<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for flight testing services for the Robust Integration Technology and Testing program (RITAT). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the flight testing services from Ohio University on a sole source basis. Flight testing involves pushing the flight envelopes to extremes and providing adequate technical support from ground facilities and engineers.	Ohio University has all the testing facilities, engineers, required airport/runway, pilots, and manpower for the flight test. Listed is the introduction about the RITAT project, contractor qualifications, service tasks, deliverables, and contract options. Introduction: RITAT (Robust Integration Technology and Testing) for GPS/INS navigation system has made significant progress in integrating a GPS/INS package with an advanced navigation processor and Kalman filter.  It is planned to conduct a flight test using a King Air Airplane in mid 2004 and again in mid 2005.   An experienced flight-testing service contractor is needed to provide an adequate airborne environment for the RITAT package with efficient turnaround and reasonable cost.  It is anticipated that the selected contractor will provide all the necessary equipment, facilities, pilots, and manpower for the flight test, except the construction and operation of the RITAT package. All work results and products including, among other things, requirement documents, data, and analysis reports pertaining to the flight testing to be performed for this contract belong to MSFC/NASA and are not restricted by contractor proprietary statement; the work results and products may be restricted to MSFC/NASA official use only. Contractor Qualifications: For safety concerns, the flight-testing provider must have at least 20 years of experience in conducting accident-free flight-testing either for commercial purposes or for the US government.  The provider organization must possess at least one King Air airplane configured for flight-testing and must provide its own hanger facility, airport, and runway while conducting flight tests.	Licensed pilots from the flight-testing provider qualified for operating the King Air airplane are required.

<DESC>The government intends to conduct sole-source negotiations for privatizing the electric utility distribution systems at Cape Canaveral AFS and Patrick AFB, Florida. The intended contract awardee is Florida Power and Light.   The decision to award on a sole-source basis for Cape Canaveral AFS was based on following facts: (1) Florida Power and Light owns and operates the 115kV overhead transmission lines that provide service to the government-owned substation. (2) Cape Canaveral AFS is eligible for special service arrangements and these will be preserved as long as Cape Canaveral AFS continues to own the downstream electrical system or if the system is transferred to Florida Power and Light. The decision to award on a sole-source basis for Patrick AFB was based on the following facts: (1) Florida Power and Light owns and operates the 115kV overhead transmission lines and equipment in the substations and transformers.  The substation is leased to Patrick AFB at a reduced rate in order to qualify for the beneficial transmission tariff. (2) Patrick AFB is eligible for special service arrangements and these will be preserved as long as Patrick AFB continues to own the downstream electrical system or if the system is transferred to Florida Power and Light. These special service arrangements are required to maintain the reliability, quality, and integrity of transmission electrical service. If the negotiations result in favorable economic determinations, contracts will be awarded for up to fifty years.  The contract will be for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the electric utility distribution systems. Access will be granted through execution of Right of Ways, and transfers of title will occur through the execution of Bills of Sale. The O&M contract will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The transfers of property and grants of access are authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2688.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award a sole-source procurement for follow-on work to McCreight and Company.  NGA has a need to procure additional consulting services in support of the NGA Office of Strategic Transformation (OST).  The purpose of this effort is to gain the expertise of commercial industry in the areas of organizational strategy development and implementation.  Previous work included consulting services to complete the development of NGA’s Corporate Strategy, Enterprise Operating Framework, and a Strategy Implementation Timeline and Action Plan. The proposed new work is providing recommendations and the development of the most efficient and effective E processes, and organizational changes in numerous areas of execution, e.g., financial management, business operations, business models, and performance measurements.  The intellectual capital and focused knowledge to support the planning study builds upon the baseline strategy articulated in the Enterprise Operating Framework. McCreight and company was a significant contributor to this effort.
 
McCreight is the only source that can perform these services due to their knowledge of NGA’s Strategic Intent, previous transformation plans and initiatives such as the Corporate Transformation Business Plan, and the results of the NGA Transformation Report produced by the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSGI) Enterprise Transformation Product Team (NETIPT), which was chartered in May 2002.  Further, due to previous work performed by McCreight and Company in support of the OST they possess current knowledge of NGA’s mission, functions, business strategies, current operating construct, and understand the organization’s role with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense.  Having any other vendor perform these services would cause a delay of approximately six to nine months to the government for the new contractor to develop the technical expertise comparable to McCreight and Company.

This is a synopsis of intent to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. The authority for sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Responsible sources that are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their ability to provide the product. All responses must be e-mailed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Attn:  Christina Griffin, GriffinCh@nga.mil by 2:00 P.M., EST, 10 February 2004. It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if e-mails have been received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intents to award a sole-source purchase order to RET Monitoring, Inc. of Tucson, AZ for providing wire tap translations, monitoring and transcribing services.  These services are required for an on-going federal investigation and the contractor must have the ability to testify on the behalf on cases currently under investigation.  RET Monitoring is the current vendor providing these services.  Another vendor providing translating monitoring services would hinder on-going investigations and court cases already in progress and jeopardize the Government’s case.  See note number 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update to the DHS SPIRIT Project.  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.   1) On November 24, 2003, the President signed into law the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Pub. L. No 108-136, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003).  With the passage of this legislation, DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, are limited to contract terms of no more than five years on all task order and delivery order contracts.  This legislation has an impact on the Coast Guard’s DHS SPIRIT project.  As such, the planned length of the DHS SPIRIT contracts is reduced from 10 years to 5 years.  2) The planned ceiling is reduced from $10B to $5B.  3) The previously planned maximum of eight (8) contracts per tier per functional area is reduced to a maximum of four (4) contracts per tier per functional area.  As a reminder, if adequate contract competition is not received in a particular tier of a functional area, we reserve the right not to award any contracts in that tier of the functional area.  4) We are in the process of revising various DHS SPIRIT pre-award documentation associated with this change.  5) A revised schedule for RFP release will be posted on this site no later than February 17th, 2004.   NOTE:  Due to overwhelming interest in this requirement, no phone inquiries, e-mails or requests to meet “one-on-one” will be answered.  All further DHS SPIRIT project information, including the RFP will be posted on this site as it becomes available.  Thank you for your patience!

<DESC>In July 2000, the Department of the Navy announced the Retail Supply function as a candidate for a Commercial Activities study in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.  The intent of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing the following services in the Mid-Atlantic Region:  1) Warehouse Operations, 2) Material Delivery, 3) Customer Service, 4) Inventory Management, 5) Program Management, and 6) Unique Industrial Activity Support.  Limiting conditions for this acquisition include the need for the Service Provider to be fully capable of supporting the various operational and Systems Commanders requiring Retail Supply support.  These operational and Systems Commanders include, but are not limited to, Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP); Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR); Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA); Naval Ordnance Command (NAVORD); Commander, Naval Installation (CNI); Space and Warfare Command (SPAWAR); and various Naval Stations, Naval Air Stations, and Industrial Activities, such as Norfolk Naval Shipyard.  This effort will include support for various functions such as the nuclear operations conducted at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and the weapons assembly operations at RSO Peninsula's Yorktown site.  Accordingly, the Service Provider must be capable of gaining access to all facilities requiring support, to include the ability to obtain all necessary security clearances.  In addition, the Service Provider must have expertise in the multifaceted Supply-related Information Technology (IT) systems, including Uniform Automated Data Processing System (UADPS), UADPS U2, Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS), Material Access Technology (MAT), Integrated Logistics Support Management System (ILSMIS), Equipment Management and Control System (EMACS), World Ports System (WPS), Relational Supply (R-Supply). These site-specific systems are critical to the performance of the Retail Supply function due to their integration with the overall operations of the customers at the various sites.  Due to this operational interrelationship, use of alternative systems will not be allowed.  The offeror determined to represent the best value to the Government will be compared to the Government's proposal to perform the Retail Supply services. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract.  The resulting contract will be for a base period of one year with four one year option periods and an anticipated start date of 1 April 2005.  NAICS 561210 applies.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www2.eps.gov.  The current solicitation, N00189-03-R-0002, will be reopened and amended to provide for full and open competition.  Direct all questions to FISC Norfolk, Detachment Philadelphia, Attn:  Daniel Damanskis, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA  19111, telephone:  (215) 697-9730 or email:  daniel.damanskis@navy.mil.  The amendment will be issued on or about 20 February 2004.

Supplier to provide a copy of their College of American Pathologists Certification as required by CAP accreditation and their Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) accreditation. 3.  Questions and answers: a.   Are there to be two daily pick ups, one at Lemoore and the other at Fallon?      Yes, we require a dail y pick-up at both Lemoore and Fallon. b.   If yes to above, then why the need for mail out supplies if there are daily pick ups?      We try to utilize all products from our patients to the best of our abilities. This often includes using one test tube for different tests. We ask for the mail-out tubes so we may separate serum/plasma for both in-house and reference lab testing. We also individually bio-bag each specimen before it leaves to the reference laboratory.  c.   Our  proficiency manuals are all written in NCCLS CAP format.  We are a CLIA approved laboratory and have a California DHS license.  Can we submit a bid for consideration?       Offerors are required to be accredited by both CAP & CLIA. d.   Why the large amount of Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Analysis testing at Lemoore?       As a new continuum of care at our facility, we are now ordering CF screens  on all new OB patients.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will:

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, DC, recently requested USTDA assistance in implementing an air traffic control (ATC) system for western Indonesia (specifically, the airspace over the island of Sumatera and neighboring smaller islands, which is currently managed by Singapore through a bilateral agreement with Indonesia).  This request was publicly reiterated by Indonesia’s Minister for Transportation, Communication and Posts (MOTCP), during a recent visit to Washington, DC.  In addition to the ATC project idea, this Definitional Mission shall also investigate other priorities identified by the Minister, including an Open Skies Agreement and bringing Indonesia into the “Galileo” air ticketing system.  No additional information project is available for the Definitional Mission.
	 
The Contractor for this activity would travel to Jakarta to meet with the MOTCP and the Directorate General of Air Communications, to discuss this ATC project and other priority aviation sector projects for the Ministry.  The Contractor would also travel to western Indonesia to assess infrastructure requirements, and may need to travel to Singapore, if appropriate and necessary.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research, to determine industry interest and capability.  This is not a request for proposals. 

This Sources Sought synopsis follows the effort expended on May 21, 2003. After performing that market research, the Agency is further soliciting industry inputs from a broader perspective. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) to support the mission of the Agency. 

 DTRA's mission is to safeguard America's interests from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosives) by controlling and reducing the threat and providing quality tools and services for the warfighter.  The objective of the future solicitation is to acquire technical, business, and operational advisory and assistance services for DTRA and its operational elements, in support of research, planning, designing, developing, implementing, integrating, testing, applying, and evaluating emerging and mature technologies and developing and transitioning capabilities to DTRA customers. Furthermore, the services sought will assist the Directorates to perform their mission as delineated below: 

 Combat Support: This mission supports the essential Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) response capabilities, functions, activities and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of forces in-theater at all levels of threat and to assist in civil support.  This area includes but is not limited to the development of strategic and tactical employment concepts for advanced nuclear weapons, consistent with evolving national policy; enhanced security and surety systems for positive control, storage, transport, maintenance and operation of nuclear weapons; improved WMD response capabilities; assessments of the threat from improvised nuclear devices to include radiological dispersion devices; and WMD forensics capabilities. 

Technology Development: Conducts research and development in order to develop unconventional and conventional means to functionally defeat WMD facilities and delivery systems, and hard and deeply buried targets; develops models of terrorist behavior to anticipate terrorist actions; improves detection and characterization of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats; develops nuclear weapons effects lethality and survivability models, tools and devices; and, develops models to assess the significance of simulation versus simulators and identify the limitations of each. 
	
Threat Control: The objective of this mission is to shape and manage technology security.  This includes but is not limited to developing non-intrusive detection mechanisms for WMD; integrating surveillance, detection and characterization of threats; developing supernetworks which can interconnect multiple databases and perform detailed analysis of large masses of data; assessing the impact of future arms control treaty policy and implementation; and, innovating advanced technologies for verification and compliance monitoring.  

Threat Reduction: This mission assists eligible states of the former Soviet Union to reduce the threat of WMD device proliferation.  This includes but is not limited to improving management systems for enhanced monitoring and accountability of high value items; developing enhanced security systems for positive control of weapons and weapons by-products; assessing policies and strategies for expanding current agreements; and, developing structural protection, response, and repair tools.  

Support Functions: The objective of this area is to develop innovative management practices to streamline and make more effective the Agency's resource, business, information, and security and intelligence management activities.  This area includes but is not limited to: personnel, budget and logistics management; acquisition, administration, process improvement, and public and congressional outreach; identification of future concepts to leverage information technology and human initiative; and, develop requirements and perform security, intelligence and counterintelligence functions to provide appropriate protection for information and government property and prevent hostile acts that may impact our personnel.

Some of the highly technical and complex expertise required to provide support to these 
DTRA missions include, but not limited to:

&#61623; Application of accepted business management and analysis methods to large, complex high-risk programs
&#61623; DoD procurement process and methods for expedited acquisition and delivery of products and services

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is interested in soliciting capability statements from qualified small business offerors for a possible small business set aside program.  The program that is being considered is to establish a data and clinical coordinating center (DCCC) to manage a registry of patients receiving a mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) for the treatment of heart failure.  The purpose of the registry is to collect and analyze clinical and laboratory data from 60 to 70 participating clinical centers in the United States concerning patients who are receiving newly approved MCSDs as destination therapy for end-stage heart failure.  Data on patients receiving MCSDs for bridge to transplantation will also be collected and analyzed.  It is anticipated that the DCCC will need to have the capacity to collect blood and tissue samples and data on approximately 2,000 patients per year for a period of 5 years.  Specifically, the DCCC will: a) develop the study protocols to collect data, blood and tissue samples, develop study policies, a manual of operations, study forms and informed consent documents in collaboration with a steering committee and the NHLBI, b) collect, format and store data, c) provide statistical analysis of the data and develop necessary software for this analysis, d) establish methods and procedures for tissue collection and storage, and e) facilitate interaction among the participating centers and provide administrative and logistical support for publication and dissemination of findings.

As a minimum, prospective offerors must document capabilities in the following areas which would evidence the potential to successfully complete the work of the registry. 

	1. Demonstrated past experience in and current capability to perform in collaborative biomedical clinical projects.  Specifically, offerors must provide a description of previous multi-center research projects in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated. 

	2. Experience in and knowledge of cardiovascular and critical care medicine including the use of MCSDs as a treatment method for patients presenting with end-stage heart failure.  Physician experience in interpretation of serious adverse events in the setting of critically ill patients with multiple organ damage is also considered essential.  In this regard, it is expected that at least one physician with this expertise will be available on a daily basis to monitor the quality and completeness of the data collected and the analyses performed.  It is anticipated that a physician’s time commitment of at least 16 hours per week will be required for this program.  A curriculum vitae must be provided which details the qualifications of the physician(s), and a statement of availability to work on this program.   
	3. Offerors must possess experience in biostatistics.  It is anticipated that at least one full-time biostatistician will be required for the program in addition to the efforts of other required personnel such as computer programmers and record analysts.  Offerors must describe the experience and other qualifications of the individuals who would be assigned to work on this program.

	4. Offerors must have experience in conducting site visits to assess site performance, adherence to program procedures, accuracy and timeliness of data collection, and complete audits of study records and transmitted data.  Appropriate personnel and staff such as a research nurse and data technician should be available.  Offerors must describe the experience and qualifications of person(s) assigned to work on the program

	5. Offerors must also have experience in working with device manufacturers and complex bioengineering devices such as the MCSD.  Understanding device reliability, modes of failure, and quality control is needed to provide quality and safety monitoring for this program.

	6. Facilities available for receiving, processing, storing, and retrieving medical data accurately and efficiently should be described, including any equipment to automate the processing of data forms.      

This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the attention of the Contracting Officer at the above address.

<RESPDATE>030404
<CONTACT>Jessica Bird, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2016
<DESC>Family of Vehicle Mounts for Small Arms Description: The U.S. Army ARDEC is interested in acquiring information on non developmental  or commercially available vehicle mounts for machine guns, with the major focus  being on the High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) including but not  limited to the M998, M1114, M1025, M1026, and M1121 series HMMWVs.  The goal of  this survey is to identify weapon mounts that are capable of providing  additional force protection/projection on these vehicles, at a minimum.  The  mount platform(s) are desired to be capable of mounting, but not limited to,  the following weapon systems: .50 Cal M2 machine guns Mk19 grenade machine guns M60 machine guns M240B medium machine guns M249 squad automatic weapons Specific areas of interest include:  secondary armament mounts for M249/M240B  machine guns on the turret ring;  door-mounted platforms for M249/M240B machine  guns;  cargo area mounts for Mk19, M2, M240B, and M249 machine guns;   integrated travel lock;  depression stop;  ballistic shield;  gunner’s seat;   and low operational support cost (e.g. modular design, no special tools, easily  repairable, low/no maintenance).  The mounting systems are desired to be rugged  and highly reliable, maximizing weapon elevation/depression/traverse while  minimizing potential safety issues with fields of fire.  Quick  interchangeability of weapon platforms from one location on the vehicle to  another is desired, along with quick interchangeability of different weapons on  a single vehicle platform.  It is desired that mounting platforms interface to  the vehicles with minimal or no permanent modification to the vehicles.  It is  further desired that any new mounting configuration be compatible with existing  weapon systems and ancillary equipment, including ammunition containers and  attached sighting/targeting devices.  The ultimate goal is to identify a family  of vehicle mounting hardware that increases force protection while maximizing  the ability to use the same mount components on multiple HMMWV variants.   Interested parties shall submit a description of their concept along with  sketches, drawings, specifications (size, weight, materials, etc.), brochures,  and/or sample hardware to:  Commander ARDEC, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000, ATTN:   Mr. Anthony Cautero, AMSRD-AAR-AEW-M(D), Bldg 7 . Mr. Cautero’s email is  Acautero@pica.army.mil  and his telephone number is 973 724 6085. Submission of  samples will confirm to the Government the immediate availability of mount  hardware.  Samples will be returned, upon requested, as tested samples.  This is a Market Survey and not a pre-solicitation notice.  If a formal  solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be  published.  Respondents to this Market Survey should submit their data and  sample(s) within 30 days from the date of this publication.  All information or  samples are to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government.

8: POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.  Background 

USAID/Armenia became a full-fledged Mission in mid-1998, having previously been part of a larger regional Caucasus Mission. The program in Armenia is large, diverse, and politically sensitive.

Armenia is mountainous and arid. It is in transition from the Soviet system of laws, practices and attitudes to a market economy and democratically oriented system of government. Although Armenia has made significant progress on the political, economic and social fronts in the thirteen years since independence, there is still much room for improvement and much need for international support in this effort. In addition to its transition efforts, Armenia remains locked in conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is occupied by ethnic Armenians. The conflict is currently in a cease-fire, but there has yet been no peaceful resolution to the dispute.

The U.S. assistance program in the Caucasus is of particular strategic importance to the United States Government and enjoys high visibility and considerable interest from both the public and private sectors. In the early years of USAID involvement in Armenia, assistance was largely focused on humanitarian assistance to the extensive vulnerable population, including the large number of people displaced by internal conflicts in the region. The current USAID program is focused on helping to lay the foundation for sustainable development in the governance, economic, and social sectors. The portfolio of assistance activities is extensive, labor intensive, and requires close monitoring to ensure that it is having the desired impact.

The Senior Water & Energy Policy Advisor (SWEPA) position is in the USAID/Armenia Office of Economic Restructuring and Energy (EREO), one of two technical offices in the Mission. The SWEPA position will provide sector support in energy and water activities for: a) planning, managing, monitoring and evaluating USAID-funded technical assistance, training, and equipment and commodity procurement activities; b) advocating USAID/Armenia-sponsored legal and regulatory reforms, including privatization and sector restructuring; and c) supporting efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of integrated water resource management for enhanced environmental quality.

The general scope of SWEPA engagement includes liaising with senior energy, water, and environmental sector officials of the Government of Armenia (GOAM) and with key private sector organizations on the full range of energy and water assistance programs and on policy reform issues in the Mission portfolio on electricity and natural gas sector reform, energy efficiency and renewable energy resource development and integrated water resources management.

The objectives of the Mission’s water and energy program are found in Strategic Objective 1.5 of the new Mission strategy for FY 2004-2008, “Secure and Sustained Access to Energy and Water Resources.” SO 1.5 combines classic energy sector development and water supply/quality objectives that serve three overall, interrelated goals of U.S. assistance in Armenia: a) to promote enhanced energy security, recognizing that Armenia has limited indigenous fuel resources available; b) to provide critical economic infrastructure for growth and jobs; and c) to ensure reliable and affordable access to essential utilities for all Armenians. The strategy addresses institutional development of the governing bodies of the water and energy utilities and the delivery of safe, reliable, affordable and accessible public utilities. The problems relating to water and energy, including heat, must be solved to facilitate economic growth, raise Armenians’ living standards, and – not least important – build mutual trust and common purpose among government, the private sector, and the general citizenry. In addition, the program of activities under this SO supports the President Bush’s sustainable development initiatives for clean energy, water for the poor and global climate change. The Mission’s SO 1.5 program will support the GOAM to complete restructuring and commercialization of the existing state energy and water monopolies, including introducing commercial management practices in public utility companies. The program provides assistance to strengthen the independent regulatory body for the energy and water sectors, including working to improve the legal framework to enhance market development and attract foreign investment; it also supports development of sustainable financing mechanisms to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management and to develop Armenia’s renewable energy resources. Finally, SO 1.5 activities support GOAM efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of integrated water resource management, to prepare projects for IFI financing, and to improve the quantity and quality of regional dialogue on energy and water, both to improve resource management and to contribute to conflict resolution.

The SWEPA will be required to provide accurate and informed advice to Mission Management and key counterparts on the full range of energy and water sector issues, with particular emphasis on both policy reforms and implementation. S/he will require a depth of expertise that will allow her/him to provide leadership in these technical and policy reform areas to Mission Management, to Foreign Service National (FSN) staff, to partners and counterparts, and to customers.

The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has selected the GSA for this procurement, which shall be conducted pursuant to the laws and regulations applicable to the AOC, and the resulting award shall be made by the AOC.  The GSA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Design and Planning Services to update the Master Plan for the U.S. Capitol Complex.  The most current Master Plan for the U.S. Capitol Complex was completed and published in 1981.  Since its completion, the 1981 master plan has unofficially guided the development of the new facilities in the Capitol Complex.  In recent years, new issues have overtaken the planning assumptions that were made in the 1970's when the current Master Plan was prepared.  Proactive planning to increase safety and security has been the highest priority in the wake of emergency situations that have impacted the Capitol in recent years.  Historic preservation and maintenance liabilities have evolved over the past 30 years to new benchmarks requiring a coordinated approach to renewal and replacement.  There is a recent mandate to bring the Capitol Complex facilities into compliance with current building codes, including fire and life safety measures. Technology and telecommunications have greatly advanced the business of government, and plans are needed to fully integrate this modern infrastructure into the existing buildings.  New facilities to meet the needs of Congress and many of its support functions are under consideration.  In addition to these issues, the Capitol Complex Master Plan will address the location, massing and image of new proposed developments, consider the potential traffic/transportation/parking issues, incorporate landscape/open space/park planning, develop environmental sustainability principles and practices, formulate and development proposals and compatibilities with surrounding development initiatives of the District of Columbia and the Regional Planning Agency.  The updated Capitol Complex Master Plan will be prepared for the Architect of the Capitol and be developed in consultation with Congress, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and other key tenants of the Capitol Complex.  The Master Plan will be updated in accordance with AOC quality standards and requirements.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: (1) A complete review of the principles and outcomes of the 1981 Master Plan which would involve evaluation of each of the Planning Principles contained in the 1981 Master Plan, an assessment of the influence and longevity of these principles on subsequent initiatives, and the relevance of the principles in today's environment,  (2) Building of a consensus around a common vision for the Capitol, its operations and its development,  (3)  Preparation of  a succinct Vision Statement that summarizes each of four planning themes that will influence the future development of the Capitol Complex and the consensus that was reached as a result of consultations, discussions, and reviews,  (4)  Recommendation of a set of updated Planning Principles incorporating the relevant materials from the 1981 Master Plan for the U.S. Capitol and adding any new principles that are appropriate for the Master Plan update,  (5)  Development of  a facilities Plan for each jurisdiction within the Capitol complex:  Capitol, House of Representatives, Senate, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, Botanic Garden, and General Services (including US Capitol Police and several support functions) with each Facilities Plan providing a building statistics summary and utilization for each facility within the Jurisdiction's control.  The Facilities Plan for the House of Representatives has been initiated by separate contract and will be provided to the awarded A/E/Planning firm for integration with the Master Plan for the Capitol Complex.  (6) Development of a space needs assessment, deficiency report and projects facilities profile with a 10 year and a 20 year planning horizon for each Jurisdiction (the House space needs assessment will be provided from the prior study).  (7) Development of an "Area Plan" for each Jurisdiction which evaluates the infrastructure and support facilities (e.g. parking areas) and landscape improvements that are adjacent to, or a part of the Jurisdictional responsibilities, (8) Development of Precinct Plans to analyze and address issues of common concern and functionality among the Jurisdictions, and to identify specific impacts that might affect the surrounding neighborhoods.  The Precinct Plans will also identify ways to improve the symbiotic relationship of the Capitol with its neighbors, analyze the plans that have been developed by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the District of Columbia Office of Planning (DC-OP), and coordinate plans for the development of the Capitol Complex with local and regional planning initiatives, as appropriate,  (9) Development of narrative and graphic summaries for  the support functions that are served by remote offsite campuses/facilities and document the interconnecting systems (deliveries, couriers, transportation, information technology, etc.)  that connect these sites to the Capitol Complex,  (10)  Preparation of  the Capitol Complex Master Plan as a summary of the component planning that is done at the localized level, integrating the various individual planning efforts, establishing a framework for infrastructure and major land development systems, and developing an overall consolidated plan for the Capitol facilities. The Capitol Complex Master Plan will address updated Planning Principles, historic preservation and stewardship goals, traffic/transportation/circulation and parking system issues, landscape/open space/parks, environmentally sustainable principles and practices, permanent security, utilities and related infrastructure, facilities renovation and new development proposals for the Capitol Complex.
