Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of your proposal.

A security clearance may be required.  The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.

The Invitation for International Bid (IFIB) package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Atlanta, GA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Henry Ford Health System, 2799 West Grand Blvd, Detroit, Michigan 48202 for acquisition of 500 isolates non-E. faecium and 500 isolates of MRSA. No other sources were considered because VRSA are very rare (only 11 cases documented in the U.S. to date), and their presence has been largely confined to SE Michigan. Thus, the best place to assess carriage of precursor strains for development of VRSA, and also risk factors for carriage of these strains, is within a healthcare system that has previously documented VRSA within that institution. In order to ensure that the project goals are completed within the established timeline, the each vendor must also have access to at least 250 non-E. faecium and 250 MRSA isolates per year, and must have a collection of previously isolated MRSA and non-E. faecium VRE isolates. Hospitals must report cases of VRSA to CDC. Thus, the potential sources of this strain were identified as those hospitals that had made reports to CDC. Only two hospitals could generate sufficient numbers of isolates and to ensure more adequate representation of strains circulating in SE Michigan, Detroit Medical Center and Henry Ford Health System. Neither hospital alone could provide the number of isolates required for research.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition is to the Henry Ford Health System under authority of 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Procurement and Grants Office, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341, Reference 2010-86020. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov. The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.406-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with BSCCI as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a Firm-Fixed, performance based type contract, to provide HIV prevention abstract summaries to HIV prevention researchers and HIV prevention service providers. The specific purpose of the contract is to provide professional services to send a collection of HIV/AIDS-related abstracts (specifically focusing on the behavioral, psychosocial, and biological aspects of HIV/AIDS) of recently published articles, books and conference presentations at least three times per week to government scientists as well as other researchers and community-based service providers in the HIV prevention field. Broader dissemination of this diverse research literature will enhance the state of HIV prevention research and programs in the U.S. and abroad.<br /><br />The specific purpose of the contract is to provide professional services to send a collection of HIV/AIDS-related abstracts (specifically focusing on the behavioral, psychosocial, and biological aspects of HIV/AIDS) of recently published articles, books and conference presentations at least three times per week to government scientists as well as other researchers and community-based service providers in the HIV prevention field. Broader dissemination of this diverse research literature will enhance the state of HIV prevention research and programs in the U.S. and abroad.<br /><br />Research in the HIV prevention field has been expanding and diversifying at a rapid rate, making it difficult for researchers to stay current with the broad research literature. This is partly due to the fact that researchers in a variety of disciplines (medicine, psychology, anthropology, public health, etc.) have become engaged in the domestic and global fight against HIV/AIDS. HIV prevention research and policy developments are published in a wide variety of journals and sources, and these sources are difficult for individual researchers to consistently monitor. A systematic summary of abstracts from new research papers, books, presentations etc. focusing on the behavioral, psychosocial, and biological aspects of HIV/AIDS is critical to enable U.S. government researchers and their external research and program partners to stay abreast of the latest research and developments in HIV/AIDS prevention.
<p><br />The contract will be in compliance with FAR 37.6. Performance-based for services will include:(1) A performance work statement (PWS); (2) Measurable performance standards (i.e., in terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.) and the method of assessing contractor performance against performance standards; and (3) Performance incentives where appropriate. When used, the performance incentives shall correspond to the performance standards set forth in the contract The major tasks to be completed under this contract include: (1) Collection of abstracts (2) Electronically deliver a collection of abstracts three times a week to at least 3,000 researchers and service providers in HIV Prevention.</p>
<p>The CDC anticipates a period of performance of one 12-month base period, with four additional option years. This is not a Request for Proposal. The intention of this notice is to notify potential offerors that Solicitation No. 2010-N-12127 will be available for download on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before August 10,2010. Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. All questions must be submitted in writing to Deborah T. Workman at atl7@cdc.gov, or julio E. Lopez at jlopez3@cdc.gov. All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) website at</p>

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting, EI-80 plans to contract with Haverly Systems, Inc. by means other than the use of full and open competition.

Similarly the DOE has an existing license with Haverly that significantly lowers the cost of access to the Chevron Assays.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii).  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested parties should submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of publication of this notice, to be considered by the Governm ent.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for the purchase of consultation services to develop afeasibility demonstration of insulation density measurements by prompt gamma neutronactivation (PGNA) analysis in support of the NASA/KSC Applied Physics Laboratory, theNASA Non-destructive Working Group Cryogenic Tank NDE project and the ConstellationProgram Pad B refurbishment project. This feasibility study, should PGNA prove to be aviable technique, would result in demonstration of the PGNA technique at the GoddardSpace Flight Centers Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory Facility Test (GSFC GGAO).Though testing is not implemented in this phase of the work, test structure design andtest procedure development does require familiarity with the various aspects of thefacility where the test will be performed. Therefore, it is required that the vendorperforming this work be familiar with the GSFC GGAO facility, including the safetyprocedures, safety mechanism, neutron generator, detectors, data acquisition system, andlayout of the facility. In addition, it is necessary for the technical expert proving theconsultation services to have an in-depth knowledge of the prompt gamma technique as itapplies to complex extended media, experience in the use of the Pulsed Neutron Generator Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (PNG-GRAND) in use at GSFC, and the radiation safetyprocedures developed for the test facility. This required knowledge would be a barrier tocompetition on this work due to the time required to develop the intimate familiaritywith the facility that Dr. Jeffery Schweitzer already possesses as he is one of theco-authors of the GSFC GGAO facilitys radiation safety procedures.NASA/KSC intends to procure this requirement on a sole source basis from SchweitzerConsulting. Per the authority of FAR 6.302-1 the services are available from only oneresponsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the agency requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland intends to negotiate and award a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.501 (a) with Optical Gaging Products, Inc in Rochester, NY for the purchase of an Etalon Laser Tracer System.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>The Large Scale Coordinate Metrology (LSCM) Group provides the nation's highest accuracy dimensional calibrations to US industry for length dimensions over one meter. The LSCM group's current need requires a laser interferometer - which by international convention is the realization of the unit of length, i.e. the meter - to calibrate long length standards. Furthermore, the configuration of the calibration facility requires that the interferometer be of a tracking variety so that the moving retroflector can avoid physical obstructions without breaking the inteferometric laser beam.</p>
<p>The metrology applications require a very high accuracy spatial displacement measurement capability with an expanded (k=2) uncertainty of 0.2 &micro;m + 0.3 &micro;m/m (0.0002 mm + 0.0003 mm/m) or less. In particular, this specification requires an uncertainty no larger than 0.5 &micro;m (0.0005 mm) at 1 meter - a metrological requirement needed for testing NIST Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs).</p>
<p>NIST requires this because NIST requires the highest accuracy instruments available to perform our calibration service.</p>
<p>The only tracking interferometers that have adequate accuracy for the LSCM group's calibration needs are laser tracers. This instrument - because of its fundamental design difference from laser trackers - was specifically invented by National Measurement Institutes to meet their extremely high accuracy applications. There is only one company in the world licensed to employ this patented technology: Etalon of Braunschweig, Germany. Optical Gaging Products - OGP - is the sole representative of Etalon in the United States. There are no other distributors of this class of interments in the United States. There are no other types of instruments that have the mechanical design characteristics that eliminate uncompensated bearing runnout which is a source of measurement errors. Hence, for the specific LSCM group calibration need, the Etalon laser tracer is the only instrument that can meet our needs for accuracy requirements and OGP is the only source of this instrument.</p>
<p><br />This patented unique feature allows the tracer to remove runout errors associated with the rotation of the head - no other devise on the market has this capability. Etalon AG is the manufacturer of this patented laser system.</p>
<p><br />Optical Gaging Products, Inc. is the only authorized distributor of this patented system for the USA, and, therefore, has exclusive rights to supply this equipment.</p>
<p><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by August 11, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole source cost-type contract to design, develop, modify, and maintain Government software products in support of Naval Aviation's Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) program. MFOQA is a knowledge management capability and a software-based process that will be hosted on existing Department of the Navy (DON) computers and servers. MFOQA will collect, merge, and analyze pre-recorded aircraft flight data and other available data, such as aircrew information, aircraft custody assignment and organizational hierarchies. It will make the results available to authorized personnel at the operational unit levels and Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) leadership. Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety. MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.
<p>The effort includes software development, tailoring, and implementation of platform and mission specific requirements for integration into the Government-owned MFOQA software. All software processes are required to be maintained at a minimum of Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3. In addition, this effort includes integrated logistics support, site activation, and initial training support associated with this Government software.</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to award this effort sole source to ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation, 12015 Lee Jackson Highway, Fairfax, VA 22033-3300. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the authority found in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ManTech has supported NAVAIR in the development of the MFOQA software, integrating COTS applications within the MFOQA framework over the past 4 years. ManTech has been an integral part of the MFOQA development team, orchestrating the complex interaction of the various COTS supporting software, external data interfaces, and the enterprise database solution. ManTech has effectively managed the extensive integration with third-party software and systems including: NSWC Carderock (Bethesda, MD), SHARP, M-SHARP, Boeing SAME &amp; FAME, NGA Maps, BGI Flight Visualization, and the NLDC AME Top-Tier Drop Box. This level of third-party software integration is more substantial than typical software systems and the integration of major software products from two other IPT developers requires a strong configuration management system with direct knowledge of the interfaces and limitations of the software from the developers. The MFOQA software developed by ManTech is completely unique software requiring a new developer an extended familiarization period prior to supporting systems engineering, CM, or development activities. ManTech is the only company with the extensive experience, background, and knowledge to provide the software engineering and design, tailoring, integration, test, fielding, and training efforts required to provide the MFOQA capability to naval aviation during this period. This sole source award will ensure that the Navy continues to deliver cost-effective safety systems without unacceptable delays in fulfilling NAVAIR's requirements.</p>
<p><br />The estimated period of performance is five years. Other interested parties may submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform the services listed above if they believe they possess the required knowledge and ability to perform this requirement. These responses may be submitted via email to ruthann.oconnell@navy.mil or may be faxed to (301) 757-5955, Attn: Ruthann O'Connell, Code 2.4.2.4.2. Please respond via email or fax; no phone calls will be accepted. While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, inquiries pertaining to subcontracting opportunities should be addressed to the ManTech point of contact, Dean Eyres at (301)862-7409.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 333315   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Office of Civil Enforcement (OCE) in Washington, DC and Denver, CO intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part Thirteen (13), SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures, to FLIR Systems, Incorporated of North Billerica, Massachusetts.  This purchase will provide two FLIR GF320 infrared (IR) cameras, and two compatible FLIR IR 92mm lenses.
EPA currently uses FLIR IR cameras in support of its air toxics initiative. These cameras are specific and compatible with EPA investigative procedures for air toxics and volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring under EPA Reference Method 21.  The only other known manufacturer of gas imaging cameras does not offer a product that is suitably portable for OCE's investigative requirements.  
The FLIR GF320 is only available directly from the manufacturer and, thus, FLIR Systems is the only source available for this purchase.
No solicitation or Request For Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response; which, if received by the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.
Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.  Any questions should be directed to Michael Gilham via electronic mail (see below).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earthquake Hazards Center, has a requirement for the implementation of real-time monitoring of structural health in VA hospitals and state-of-health based earthworm, network architecture including easy-to-use graphical interface.  This is a system to monitor the state-of-health of a building during seismic shaking.  The desired system will have four major components, each with many sub-components.  (1) The first major component is the sensing and digitizing system itself, which is not specified here, but can be any vendor's hardware.  (2) The second major component is the Structure Monitoring System Processor (SMSP),which is a computer running Linux that performs all computations, alarming, and provides long term recording of the data from the digitizers.  There is an SMSP computer located at each structure.  (3) The third component is the On-Site Display, which will be a separate computer at each structure that can run an application that shows the current status of the structure's health and the state of health of the system as a whole.  (4) The fourth, and final, major component of the system is the USGS Central Server which connects to and receives data from all of the Structure Monitoring System Processors and allows an engineer to monitor many buildings and structures simultaneously and decide if the data provided is correct and allows them to take necessary action.
The Government anticipates award of a commercial, Firm-Fixed Price type contract using the procedures of FAR 13.5 (Test Program) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, "Acquisition of Commercial Items."

The Project aims to attract investment to the Nigerian market by local and international ICT companies by providing reliable clean power, bandwidth, facilities, and business and regulatory incentives. The Oshodi campus is ideal for such a development owing to its existing connections to an undersea fiber optic cable, and existing rights of way and facilities.<br /><br />This Feasibility Study will assist DBI in determining the ideal ownership and management structure for the Project, specifying infrastructure and equipment needs, including renewable energy, and creating a capital investment and implementation plan. The FS will require the contractor to assess the Project's anticipated energy needs, and make recommendations concerning the implementation of renewable energy solutions, building on DBI's strong commitment to technological innovation and renewable energy solutions.<br /><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $404,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).<br /><br />A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.<br /><br />Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

<DESC>The VA intends on negotiating SOLE SOURCE with USFin for work associated the asbestos abatement on 3 West and 4 West as indicated on the contract drawings and specifications at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center located at 1481 W. 10th St, Indianapolis, IN  46202.  Although the 4 West C-Wing area will be vacant during asbestos removal, the 3 West C-Wing area is an occupied area.  The abatement in this area will need to be coordinated with the hospital and a detailed abatement schedule will need to be submitted.  (Staff and patients will vacate certain rooms per a schedule approved by VA). VA can only give up approximately 2 rooms at a time for abatement in the 3 West area.  Once a particular set of rooms is abated on 3 West and clearance is received, the staff will move back into those rooms and the contractor will be given the next set of rooms and so on until the abatement is completed.  There will most likely be a day of downtime by the abatement contractor per each set of rooms until VA can get the one set of rooms house cleaned (rooms just abated) and patients moved out of the next set of rooms.  Weekend work shall be required as the 3 West ward usually has a lighter patient load over weekends and we may be able to work out giving more rooms to the abatement contractor over a weekend.  Contractor also has the option of working on the abatement on the 4th floor concurrently during downtime on the 3rd floor.  SET-ASIDE INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be issued pursuant to the authority of FAR 16.14, Public Law 109-461 and the Veterans Benefits Healthcare and Information Technology Act of 2006 and is a 100% Set-Aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

<DESC>  
<p class="MsoNormal">Argonne National Laboratory plays an active role in almost every aspect of DOE&rsquo;s energy storage program and is the lead laboratory for DOE&rsquo;s applied battery R&amp;D program. The DOE considers Argonne to be its advanced materials R&amp;D laboratory due to the many novel lithium battery electrode and electrolyte materials that have been and continue to be developed by Argonne scientists. Also, Argonne is one of DOE&rsquo;s two key laboratories for the independent evaluation of advanced battery technologies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This project will design and build a laboratory-scale battery-materials production facility (Materials Engineering Facility (MEF)). The purpose of the MEF is to provide the tools necessary to rapidly scale up bench-scale battery chemistries and enable quick turnaround validation of new materials chemistries. Such a facility is a key missing link between the bench-scale development of battery technology and high-volume manufacturing of large-format advanced batteries for transportation applications. The need for a dedicated research facility to support production of materials for prototyping and to support a domestic supply chain and battery manufacturing capability has been recognized throughout the industry. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The proposed MEF will fulfill this need while providing new capabilities to Argonne&rsquo;s existing battery facilities, capabilities, and expertise. The MEF will enable substantial progress to be made in the development, validation, and ultimate commercial implementation of advanced battery-materials chemistries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The MEF project plans to design and build a structure within the currently existing Building 370 High Bay interior. The structure will house wet labs, office and conference space and high bay space for the purpose of conducting the scale up battery chemistry research. Most of the facility including the labs and high bay space will be classified as H occupancy space due to the presence of significant quantities of hazardous materials needed to conduct the applied research. The exact configuration of the facility and its distribution of space sizes and types will be established during the facility conceptual design which is currently ongoing. The overall size of the new facility will be approximately 10,000 ft<sup>2</sup>.</span> The overall technical objective for this project is to construct a secure enclosed space (including its associated environmental and utility systems) capable of housing and supporting the activities of the Argonne Battery R&amp;D Program. This includes supporting the use of hazardous materials inside of the space and ensuring that the areas external to the space are not negatively impacted by the activities inside of the MEF space.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Deliverables produced by the proposed design/build contractor for this work include:</p>

Additionally, this package contains required documentation needed for future operation of the facility (e.g., fire protection assessment and hazards analysis)</p>

These designs are intended to communicate consistency with the D/B Statement of Work, the preliminary design and for use by the D/B firm to acquire subcontractor services and materials.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither BIA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. In accordance to FAR 15.201 (e), RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
This RFI is being used to gather information on products and services to assist with a significant issue arising from the upcoming retirement and decommissioning of two legacy applications.  It is assumed that all of the existing application functions will be transferred to a new system, and while some of the existing data will be archived and some will be transferred to the new database, a significant amount of the remainder of the data - hereafter called 'remainder data' -- will be neither archived nor transferred (at this time) rather it must remain accessible for purposes of discovery and for historical account management.  It is the capture and accessibility of the remainder data that is of particular interest.  Indian Affairs is amenable to conversion of the remainder data and development of access software or service.  Indian Affairs targets complete shutdown of the legacy applications and mainframe server.
Background:
Legacy applications and database are run in a Unisys computing environment consisting of COBOL ANSI 74 applications, with one database held in Unisys "Keyed I/O" flat form and others in an IBM database management environment.  The applications run on a UNISYS A series "Clearpath" NX SERVER under the MCP/AS operating system.
The configuration is a follows:
1.	Serversa.	Production Sitei.	CS7201 (Production)ii.	LX7100 (Development)b.	Disaster Recovery Sitei.	CS72012.	Peripheralsa.	Tape drive (3800 reel tapes)b.	Cartridge drive (DTL, 3480 cartridge)c.	Optical Disk drive (Tape/cartridge conversion)
Information Request:
This request for information is to solicit industry capability to provide the services satisfying government needs to access the non-archived, non-transferred (remainder) data on an as needed basis by government personnel, for government use, without the use of the legacy applications.
The capability must further meet industry best practices regarding systems availability, disaster recovery configuration and operational procedures and processes that can expressed in a Service Level Agreement (SLA).
Responding to this RFI:
RFI responses must also include:
"	Name of the primary point of contact for the response;"	Business title;"	Company;"               Business type/size (ie. Large Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Native American, etc.);"	Email address;"	Phone; and"	Identification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response.
Submission Instructions:
Responses are due no later than 4:00 EST on October 25, 2010 via email to Cathleen.Fraser@bia.gov and Thomas.Mersch@bia.gov. Please direct any questions regarding this RFI to Mr. Tom Mersch, telephone number (703) 735-4150 or via email at Thomas.Mersch@bia.gov.

Any formal solicitation that mayresult from this synopsis will be announced separately. Western is onlyinterested at this point in identifying interested and capable contractorsforthese services. Overview of Requirements: This is a world-class trainingfacility, providing training services to various disciplines within theelectric power industry.  The EPTC services are first offered to Westernsfour(4) Regional offices and second to other electric power entities on a firstcome, first served basis.

The two modeled systems are to be electrically connected via theback-to-back High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) ties that exist between theWECC and MRO entities.Contractor must be able to interface to existing Regional DTS systems, orif noexisting Regional DTS, then provide necessary equipment and interface(s) todoso.  The current systems in use are from AREVA T&D, GE Harris, and a MSWindowsPC-based system.For Western power system operators, the interfaces need to mimic as closeaspossible the systems they operate in order to emulate what is currentlyused intheir respective Region.  Western will provide current display data to thevendor. Provided systems must be compliant with all current applicable NERCCIPStandards and Requirements. Must allow for updates to model, displays,etc.,with low to moderate difficulty.

<p>Request for Information (RFI) on development of an Online Course Module (OCM) for the M-581 Fire Program Management course, hosted by the National Advanced Fire and Resource Institute (NAFRI).</p>
<p>1. Introduction <br />This RFI lists the requirements for the OCM needs to support the resident curriculum of the same course.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NAFRI is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Interested parties are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2. Background<br />NAFRI is a national inter-agency wildland fire management training facility that provides training courses for individuals from a wide variety of agencies tasked with wildland fire management duties, federal and state.</p>
<p>The M-581, Fire Program Management course is required for individuals who have just become or will shortly become a wildland fire program manager at the unit and or local level of a federal natural resource agency; U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>A unit or local fire program manager is one who applies fire management principles and practices for the protection and enhancement of the wildland environment. A fire program manager integrates fire-related environmental, social, political, economic and technological information into land management activities to meet desired objectives. The manager initiates most actions based upon his/her experience in and knowledge of the functional responsibilities.</p>
<p>The current course curriculum contains a wide spectrum of instruction that includes remote and resident sessions. Current curriculum consists of 5 units and 30 subunits.<br />The development of an OCM for this course is the intent of this RFI.</p>
<p>Based on the information received from this RFI, NAFRI will build a Request for Proposal (RFP). At this time NAFRI seeks to provide the best instruction at the best price to its work force.</p>
<p>The OCM needs are;<br />To allow access to those employed as federal wildland firefighters, course coordinators, lead instructors and coaches to review unit and subunit progress and results of tests on learning.</p>
<p>Allow user profile creation at first login. Required user information: Last name, First name, Incident Qualifications and Certification system (IQCS) ID #, Agency, Geographic Area (GA), Unit, Email, &amp; Phone.</p>
<p>User login information is captured in a database that can be reviewed by national coordinator(s), GA coordinators, lead instructors and coaches.</p>
<p>Have unit / subunit self testing and self grading .The program should provide unit and subunit tests on learning with an acceptable passing score of 70% before allowing individuals to proceed. Those that do not pass at the 70% level will be directed to a new but equivalent curriculum to review and retest. Each unit and subunit test/quiz will be graded by the program provided, and save the results to a database that can be monitored by both the participant and GA coordinators, coaches and instructors.</p>
<p>Track progress - Ability of the participant to track their own progress and view each test/quiz score results. Course coordinators, coaches, or lead instructors from each GA will be able to login and review the progress and status of those students enrolled from their GA.</p>
<p>Tests on learning will involve at least three levels of interactivity. Tests will include one diagnostic pretest and two mastery post test. Whenever possible a test item bank will be created for all performance measurement instruments/tests (pre &amp; post). The test item bank will consist of the equivalent of three (3) questions per LO/ELO. All test items will be equivalent in difficulty and content coverage.</p>
<p>The length of the self study curriculum will be based on review of current curriculum and the complexity of course purpose, scope, course and lesson objectives, and overall course content. Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) level one will be used only for introductions. IMI levels two and three can be considered for actual lesson and assessment development.</p>
<p>The "Host" for this curriculum must be a server that the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife and U.S. Forest Service employees can access without restriction issues specific to one agency or another.</p>
<p>Must be 508 compliant.</p>
<p>Entire OCM must be usable as a self contained program of instruction on DVD to accommodate users without broadband or internet access. Alternate progress tracking, testing and grading abilities will need to be considered.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, located in Miami, FL intends to acquire analytical services <br />to discern the degree of genetic variation in temperature tolerance of planktonic larvae of Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed elkhorn (Acropora spp). Period of performance is (12) twelve months.
<p>The contractor shall be conducting experiments in Aug-Sept 2010 with larvae collected/fertilized from Acropora parents of known genotypes in Key Largo, FL, exposing them to three different temperature treatments throughout their pelagic larval duration. Under this contract, the contractor will analyze, and assist in interpretation of results, the temperature-stress gene expression of these (Florida) larvae to discern if Florida larvae have similar response to temperature as Puerto Rico larvae. Results will help elucidate the amount of genetic variation in this imperiled coral which could potentially provide scope for adaptation to global climate change.</p>
<p>Requirements: There are two tasks under the contract<br />TASK 1: Provide multilocus genotypes for up to 500 coral colonies (potential parents for the larval experiments and other members of the population)<br />This contract requires analytical services to determine the multilocus genotype of up to 100 Acropora palmata tissue samples (ethanol-preserved) provided by SEFSC according to the methods of Baums et al. (2005). Results will be provided to SEFSC in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>TASK 2: Microarray analysis and interpretation <br />The contractor shall analyze larval gene expression of A.palmata larvae from 2010 Key Largo temperature exposure experiments utilizing the novel microarray developed from temperature exposures of A.palmata larvae in Puerto Rico (2008-2009). <br />Results will be provided in a written report.</p>
<p><br />The government knows of only one source Dr. Iliana Baums at the Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Iliana Baums is the developer o the microsatellite genetic marker system which has been validated and documented to distinguish genotypes of A.palmata with high confidence. Dr. Baum's has published results on this method and the only known source that can reasonably be expected to complete the work efficiently and accurately. The A.palmata larval microarray is the completely novel took that Dr. Baums has under development. The specifications of this method have not yet been published and Dr. Baums' is the only known laboratory that can apply this genomic tool to elucidate the genomic response of ESA listed corals in the Florida temperature exposure experiments.</p>
<p>To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their education, experience and capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service. Interested parties must respond within&nbsp;seven (7) days after publication of this notice. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. Faxed information can be sent to 816-274-6983 or physically sent Department of Commerce, Attn: Sharon Walker, 601 E. 12th St, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106.

<DESC>This is the fourth attempt to transmit this announcement into the FBO System.  The first attempt to transmit this announcement was submitted on 7/13/2010.
The National Park Service intends to issue a sole source award to PaperThin, Inc. for consulting and support services for their Commonspot Content Management System. To enable a closer relationship, PaperThin and NPS will enter into a more engaged Support Services relationship.
The goals for this engagement are to: Ensure that PaperThin's extensive experience and best practices are made available to NPS/DOI. Provide strategic technical consultation on architectural issues related to the inner workings/architecture of CommonSpot. Ensure that NPS/DOI utilize CommonSpot's framework to its fullest capabilities and deploy websites and applications rapidly and efficiently in a supported manner. Create acommunication pipeline that allows issues/questions to be identified and resolved faster and ultimately to create a process of growth that steers the NPS/DOI CommonSpot implementation away from future issues.
The NPS currently uses PaperThin's CommonSpot software and recently began expanding use of the software for full integration of all hosted websites within the NPS framework (both public and private). NPS requires PaperThin's unique knowledge to ensure that the NPS configuration and system architecture meet with the best practices of the product and all development work is completed in an optimal way that will meet scalability and system requirements.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes there shall be no written solicitation to follow. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for the purpose of conducting market research and ontaining industry information only. The National Park Service will use information obtained through this synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy. Proposals are NOT being requested, nor accepted at this time.
Yellowstone National Park is seeking sources for a portable gas meter. The Yellowstone National Park Geology Program staff is required to enter hazardous geothermal areas.  The geothermal areas may contain lethal concentrations of geothermal gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.  Minor amounts of methane and potentially sulfur dioxide may also be present.  The Geology Program is in need of gas monitors that will measure the concentration of these gases, including oxygen.  The gas meter should have the required gas sensors in one, portable meter.  Carbon dioxide needs to be measured in the 0% to 100% range, hydrogen sulfide in the 0 to 1,000 parts per million range, oxygen in the 0 to 24% range and the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) in the 0 to 100% range.  Battery life should be in the 8 hour to 16 hour range for extended field deployments.  The meter should be field portable (less than 4 pounds) and have datalogging capabilities.  
Again, at this time the National Park Service is not accepting porposals but is requesting interested business furnish information: (1) Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone, Email Address. (2) Business Type, (3) Business Size.
Al responses must be submitted via email to: Andrea_Brew@nps.gov by August 1, 2010.

<CONTACT>Christopher A. Gray, Phone 301.677.5350, Email christopher.gray@disa.mil
<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUMMARY:</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), FY2010 Working Capital Fund Audit</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>This sources sought announcement is published for market research purposes. This market research will be used to help identify Small Business Administration certified 8(a) companies capable of providing the required Audit Services. Request that prospective offerors complete and return a Capabilities Statement as described below to determine which contractors possess the capability, experience, and financial ability to provide the security operations services. The Government is in no way obligated to do business with or to enter into any form of contract with any person, firm, or other entity that receives or responds to this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-576), as amended by the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-356), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136, "Financial Reporting Requirements," and the Department of Defense (DoD) Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 6B, "Form and Content of DoD Audited Financial Statements," require the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</p>
<p>Recently, DISA completed a validation effort in preparation for a financial statement audit. The Independent Public Accountant's (IPA) overall validation assessment is that DISA's Working Capital Fund is ready for audit.</p>
<p>Section 1008 of the "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002" requires that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) assess the reliability of the Department of Defense (DoD) financial statements, including the financial statements of each component of the Department. For FY 2010, the Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller has directed that, Other Defense Agencies, like DISA, can choose whether to produce financial statements, and by extension whether these are to be audited. The Director, DISA has chosen to pursue the production of audited financial statements to increase our credibility for DoD.</p>
<p>The objective of the audit will be to determine if DISA's Working Capital Fund (WCF) FY 2010 Balance Sheet, Statement of Net Cost, Statement of Changes in Net Position, and Statement of Budgetary Resources presents fairly, in all material respects, the balance of the financial statements.</p>
<p>DISA Headquarters is located in Arlington, VA. The DISA Accounting Compliance Directorate, which is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements, is located in Columbus, OH. DISA has financial and business management offices located in the National Capital Region; Scott Air Force Base, IL; Denver, CO; Pensacola, FL; Pearl Harbor, HI; and Stuttgart, Germany. These locations perform commitment, obligations, accrual and managerial accounting tasks. DFAS Columbus currently provides all operational accounting and reporting functions for DISA. The primary place of performance for this is expected to be Columbus, OH.</p>
<p>SCOPE: The objective of the audit will be to determine if DISA's WCF FY 2010 Balance Sheet, Statement of Net Cost, Statement of Changes in Net Position, and Statement of Budgetary Resources presents fairly, in all material respects, the balance of the financial statements.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide to the DISA a combined report for the DISA WCF FY 2010 audit that includes the following elements:</p>
<p>- Contractor opinion on the DISA principal financial statements, including the related notes, as to whether DISA financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), consistently applied.<br /><br />- Contractor report on DISA's internal controls including the status of DISA's known but uncorrected material findings and recommendations from prior audits that affect the current audit objectives.</p>
<p>- Contractor report on DISA's compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as compliance matters coming to the Contractor's attention during procedures other than compliance tests.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, DISA requires support from a contractor whose primary function is financial statement auditing. The Government intends to award Firm Fixed Price contract. The term of the resulting contract will be a one year base period with four one-year options for the audits of the fiscal years 2011 through 2014 financial statements. In addition, beginning with option year one, DISA has the option to add an additional CLIN to expand the scope and add the General Fund Audit with the same requirements as the WCF audit. The scope of the engagement will be determined in accordance with the FAM and the specific contract.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR CAPABILITES STATEMENT: Interested small and large businesses should provide a capability statement to address their ability and experience to perform the tasks associated with the requirements stated below, and submits them to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Corporate Experience: Clearly describe your background, capability and experience providing and supporting DoD Financial Statement audits/validations. If providing similar work performed in this area, please include the following information as part of your submission:<br /><br />&#61607; Who did your company provide the services to indicating whether they were DoD, Federal, State or Municipal Government, Education Institution, Commercial, etc. <br />&#61607; Contract number or other identifying reference (if applicable)<br />&#61607; Did you perform as the Prime or Sub contractor? <br />&#61607; Period of Performance<br />&#61607; Annual Dollar Value <br />&#61607; Contract Type (Cost, Firm Fixed Price, Time &amp; Materials, etc.) - if applicable<br /><br />Phase In: All contractors should address their ability to ramp up and meet the requirements from date of award that is projected for September of 2010.</p>
<p>RESPONSES TO RFI: All responses must not exceed 15 single spaced pages, 12-point type with at least a one-inch margin on an 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper. The responses should specifically describe the contractor's ability to meet the requirements outlined in the RFI.

<DESC>This Sources Sought notice is for informational and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award.   The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy.  This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research.<BR><BR>The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified commercial, small business sources technically capable of providing hospital environmental services for designated Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Southeast Regional Medical Command.  Currently, these services are performed by a small business under four (4) different purchase orders; this new requirement will consolidate the four (4) contract vehicles into one (1) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for issuing of firm-fixed price task orders.  <BR><BR>The Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC) has a requirement for the continuation of hospital environmental services (formally the Hospital Housekeeping Services) in support of multiple MTFs.  MTFs are medical facilities operated by the military and vary in capabilities in partnership with healthcare providers, medical educators, and medical researchers.   For this effort, MTFs is a collective term of 84 integrated medical, dental, veterinary, and other medical department healthcare and healthcare-related facilities and buildings located on Fort Gordon, GA, Fort Jackson, SC, Fort Campbell, KY, and Redstone Arsenal, AL.  The raw square feet (RSF) applicable to hospital environmental services are varied for each MTF; as such, the current aggregate raw square feet (RSF) of all MTFs are 1,741,290.  The current approximate RSF per MTF is as follows:  Fort Gordon, GA, David Dwight Eisenhower Army Medical Center (DDEAMC), 779,008; Fort Campbell, KY, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital (BACH), 513,092; Fort Jackson, SC, Moncrief Army Community Hospital (MACH), 344,958; and Redstone Arsenal, AL, Fox Army Health Clinic (FAHC), 104,231.  The aggregate RSF of all MTFs will not to exceed 1,915,419 (10% above current aggregate raw square feet) RSF per year.  The total aggregate RSF of all MTFs for a five-year period is 8,706,450, and will not exceed 9,577,095 RSF (10% above total aggregate RSF x five years).  Hospital environmental services (formally identified as hospital housekeeping services) are required for the period of 01 October 2011 through 30 September 2016, inclusive of an anticipated two-year base period, and three one-year option periods.  The total estimated value of this requirement is not to exceed $68M.<BR><BR>Description of Services:  The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, tools, materials, management, and supervision (except for those items specified as government-furnished property, supplies, equipment and services) necessary to perform non-personal, hospital environmental services (HES) to designated MTFs located in the Southeast Regional Medical Command.  HES are inclusive of hospital housekeeping (aseptic and non-aseptic), control and exchange of linen, regulated medical waste (RMW) collection and removal, general waste (trash) collection and removal, recycle collection and removal, and exterior building services (e.g., windows, doors, walkways, parking lots) such as window cleaning, outdoor policing, and snow removal.  Aseptic housekeeping is distinguished from non-aseptic housekeeping in that the primary work of the former is to maintain total disinfection conditions in designated areas of MTFs.  The Contractor shall provide hospital environmental services consistent with the most modern and scientific methods of environmental service practices and techniques to include the highest level of sanitary procedures.

<DESC>Background. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is in the midst of planning a follow-on acquisition to replace the SMC Financial Support (SFS) and SMC Acquisition Support (SAS) programs for Advisory &amp; Assistance Services (A&amp;AS). The SFS program provides financial, cost management, schedule management, and related training A&amp;AS support to SMC organizations. The SAS program provides manpower, personnel, administration, configuration/data management, acquisition planning, contracting and associated training support. Both programs awarded task orders under FAR 8 Fair Opportunity business rules via SMC Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) based upon GSA Professional Engineering Services (PES), Schedule 871, contracts. This work was set-aside for small business BPA holders with less than 1,000 employees consistent with NAICS code 541710 (circa 2002). Both programs are expected to complete by mid calendar year 2011.<br /><br />
<p>Follow-On. SMC anticipates a single follow-on acquisition that integrates reduced functionalities of SFS and SAS. SMC held an A&amp;AS Industry Day in Jan 2010 to augment market research activities to form the initial basis for the acquisition strategy. Information and valuable insight from this event are available at the following link:</p>
<p>https://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFSC/SMCSMSC/SMC_A-AS_Market_Research/listing.html</p>
<p>C2C. Coupled to this acquisition, it is anticipated that SMC Contractor to Civilian Conversion (C2C) activities will directly impact effort on this program. The goal of C2C is to convert contracted A&amp;AS support to Government civilian staffing. The SMC C2C plan is currently in progress but will take several years to complete.</p>
<p>Status. The program name formally changed from the temporary moniker of "SPS" to SMC Acquisition and Financial Services (SAFS). Under FAR Part 15, the Government intends to compete "Prime" and "Companion" IDIQ contracts that provision Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursement A&amp;AS effort. Contract scope will derive from the former SFS and SAS programs but will be tempered by C2C, organizational conflict of interest principles, and current dialog on the definition of "near" and inherently governmental functions. At the task order competitions, SMC intends to leverage Firm-Fixed Price to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p>Subject to acquisition plan approval, the SAFS Prime contracts is intended to be reserved for Small Business under NAICS code 541712 (circa 2007) that carries a 1,000 employee size standard. The SAFS Companion contracts are being considered exclusively for 8A, HUBZONE Small Businesses (HSBs) and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) under NAICS code 541611 [$7M size standard]. The government intends to issue the Prime and Companion contracts as complementary but mutually exclusive in contract scope. Selection of each contract scope will be based on market research. The follow-on acquisition is expected to be solicited 1st quarter of calendar year 2011 and ready for the commencement of work by July 2011. To validate the companion contract strategy and its contract scope, additional market research is required to assess market capabilities.</p>
<p>SMC objectives under the SAFS companion contract strategy are to increase competition, make opportunities available to the 8A, HUB and/or SDVOSB community, and encourage the development of long-term space support capabilities.</p>
<p>Market Survey: The enclosed market survey and SAFS draft PWS are directed to better ascertain the current market dynamics and availability of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) support contractors for SMC. This survey is focused on receiving market feedback to complete market research analysis in preparation for the SAFS acquisition plan. This information is for market research only and will not be used for company pre-qualification or qualification for a contract.<br /><br />Please send a completed survey via email to the POC and Secondary POC NLT the close date/time of this Special Notice.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Planning Branch, Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, intends to award under a sole source basis, a purchase order to the Mayo Clinic, Celiac Disease Laboratory in Rochester, MN. The purpose of this action is to secure the services of the Mayo Clinic to conduct laboratory tests.
<p>The NCHS has a new test requirement for the diagnosis of Celiac disease. The purpose of this procurement is to enlist a laboratory to perform IgA tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TTG) and IgA endomyseal antibody (EM_IgA) testing needed for the diagnosis of Celiac disease. The government utilizes various methods for conducting laboratory specimen testing for the NHANES surveys. Some are conducted in various CDC laboratories and others are contracted to various laboratories around the world depending on the specimen and the specific laboratory's expertise. Other federal agencies were consulted for possible sources of laboratories that could perform this testing.</p>
<p>A detailed search of the Centers within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was performed in an effort to locate a laboratory that would perform the IgA-TTG, and EMA_IgA testing. The CDC telephone directory was browsed for any possible leads in each Center. Telephone calls were made to the Office of the Directors. Telephone calls to known laboratory contacts within NCEH and NCID who perform most of the laboratory testing within CDC were also made. It was determined that no CDC lab can be used for these celiac tests.<br />Since the prevalence of celiac disease is close to 1% of the US population, which is relatively rare, IgA-TTG and EM_IgA testing isn't routinely performed in most laboratories; therefore, only specialty laboratories perform this testing. It is imperative that an expert laboratory with sufficient experience and capacity perform this testing for NHANES. The testing must be an integral part of the laboratory where testing occurs daily. The laboratory for testing NHANES must be performing the work on a continuing basis to assure to assure compliance for CDC results. The laboratory must have the necessary reagents and supplies on hand to meet the NHANES three week requirement for delivery of test and quality control results.</p>
<p>Based on all the research of alternatives within CDC, contracting out is the only viable alternative. Market research determined that there is only one source with the qualifications to meet the needs of NCHS to fill this requirement. Of the few labs that could perform the testing, the Mayo Clinic is the only laboratory that can meet the requirements of NHANES laboratory testing of IgA-TTG and EMA_IgA.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be for a base period of 12 months, with two 12-month option periods for a total of 36 months. Award is scheduled for on or around August 16, 2010. This acquisition is being procured applying Simplified Acquisition Procedures, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.106-1(b). The circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. The Mayo Clinic is the only available source with the required expertise to provide the services. The CDC is not requesting proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer no later than 4:00 pm EST, on August 9, 2010 (15 days). Determination not to compete the proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of responses. Inquiries may be sent to Penny Holley by email at pholley@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Marketing Systems Group for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) sampling. The proposed contract action will be awarded under FAR Part 12 for a Base Year and two Option Years for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. For most states, the BRFSS is the only source for this type of information. This sole source contract is to ensure the continuity of sampling during the critical phase of incorporation of new sample frames. Cell phone samples, first introduced as pilot studies in 2008, will become an integral part of the BRFSS sample more accurately representing the proportion of the population which relies exclusively on cell phones for personal communication. Currently all vendors with prior experience with BRFSS utilize databases from Marketing Systems Group (MSG) to create samples for telephone survey research. MSG is the developer of the GENESYS database, which is updated quarterly and is thoroughly described below. For most states, the BRFSS is the only source for this type of information.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure service from&nbsp;Cascadia Research located in Olympia, Washington&nbsp;for the US Department of<br />Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service&nbsp;.<br />Statement of Work CINMS requires a contractor to construct a pair of satellite transmitter tags and deploy those tags and other data logging tags for the purpose of tracking the movement of endangered Fin Whales in and around the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Construction of these instruments will add additional instruments to an existing inventory of tags that are used to evaluate whale movements as part of an ongoing project that evaluates behavioral responses of these whales to the hazard of approaching large vessels. The contractor will also work collaboratively with CINMS staff to deploy the instruments during research cruises. In addition to constructing and deploying the instruments, the contractor shall provide data and reports of their findings to CINMS.<br />1.1 Organization The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS), of the National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC) is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship of living marine resources.<br />1.2 Background and Objectives The sanctuary provides scientific and technical support to NOS, NOAA and the DOC for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the CINMS marine resources. These resources include species listed under the Endangered Species Act - whose recovery is dependent on both an improvement in the status of populations and the mitigation of threats to those populations. <br />Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are widely appreciated as the second largest animal that has ever lived on this planet and as a species that has undergone profound depletion as a consequence of commercial whaling and other human impacts. Current stock status off the US west coast is listed as 2,316. A recent history of low numbers globally has lead to the species' protection under the Endangered Species Act as "endangered" well as listing under the Marine Mammal Protection Act as "depleted" &amp; "strategic". They spend a significant fraction of the year within the boundaries of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) -- approx. June-November-- feeding on vast clouds of planktonic krill that occur in and around the sanctuary over that period. As such, they are clearly a living marine resource that the National Marine Sanctuary Act was drafted to preserve and manage. <br />The Fall of 2007 saw 5 confirmed blue whale fatalities in the Southern California Bight. Since then there has been an additional blue whale fatality and three fin whale fatalities from ship strikes. Previously, the greatest number of great whale fatalities within an entire year on the west coast was three (1988 &amp; 2002), and these were separated by hundreds of miles (Marin to San Diego County in 2002) and several months. The events of the last 3 years across a space focused on the Northern Channel Islands are anomalous and suggestive of a problem. In 2004 the National Marine Fisheries Service determined that an acceptable level for the Potential Biological Removal of this species as 1.4 whales per year in U. S. waters based on their current, endangered population status. Thus, 2007's loss is significant and suggests the need for some degree of monitoring to evaluate the status of the great whales in the sanctuary and the patterns of habitat use with an eye toward management of whale-ship interactions. <br />An important component of addressing this need is research to understand how the whales react to the hazard of approaching ships. Animal-based data logging and telemetric instrumentation, customized for particular data types, provides information necessary to understand and track whale movements generally and their responses to the approach of large vessels in particular. Attaching these instruments to these large animals requires specific skills to ensure the functional application of the tags as well as maintenance of safety of the animals and the human researchers. <br />The work performed in this project will include:<br />1.2.1 Construction of two satellite tags to add to current tag inventory and <br />1.2.2 The deployment of the tags on animals in and around the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br />2.0 Technical Requirements
<p>2.1 Specific Technical Products This project will address the objective of providing detailed location and behavior information on fin whales in and around the CINMS relative to the locations and traffic patterns of large shipping.</p>
<p>2.2. This order consists of tasks with the following technical specifications:</p>
<p>2.2.1 The vendor qualified to provide technical services must possess the following experience and training:<br />&bull; Applicable academic training and experience in the handling of large whales including documented experience attaching data logging and transmitting tags to great whales and managing and communicating the resulting data;<br />&bull; Familiarity and experience in the collection of Research and monitoring data from ocean-going platforms;<br />&bull; Have educational and work experience in the disciplines of Ecology, Oceanography and Conservation Biology.<br />&bull; Familiarity with the strengths and limitations of field data collected using the specific animal-mounted, data-logging tags.</p>
<p>2.2.2 The vendor must have a documented work experience analyzing field data, understanding of the limitations of different data types, performing data quality control, and designing data acquisition techniques using multiple analytical technologies.</p>
<p>2.2.3 The vendor shall have all necessary permits to allow close approach, contact, tagging and interaction with large whales under both the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />3.0 DELIVERABLES<br />The following shall be provided to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary: The contractor will construct two satellite position monitoring tags for attachment to Fin Whales in and around the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. These tags will log time, depth and location to provide correlated animal positions and the behavioral data. Funding is provided for materials to construct the satellite tags. The contractor will be on-site during cruises performed in calendar year 2010 and 2011 with CINMS research staff to deploy and recover data logging tags and perform follow-up data analysis and communication.</p>
<p>3.1 Deliverables for 2.1.1:</p>
<p>&bull; Satellite Tags: The vendor will supply two satellite Mk10A location and TDR recording tags assembled for deployment on the animals to the field site ready for deployment.<br />&bull; Project Reports: Reports detailing activities conducted and preliminary results will be provided to the CINMS in Spring 2012. <br />&bull; Data: Contractor shall provide data on whale locations to a database accessible to CINMS.<br />&bull; Deployments: Contractor will collaborate with Scripps Institution of Oceanography (co-principal investigator not funded in this contract) and CINMS research staff on research cruises of the R/V Shearwater to deploy and monitor the tags. This activity will include the deployment of contractor's own soft-hulled small boat to allow close approach to the animals while maintaining the study animal's safety. Funds are identified in the budget to fund the boat time for this small boat.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 5 ERRS CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-S5-08-04. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT. The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #18 is to obligate $200,000.00 for a Brownfield Cleanup and Restoration at 1100 E. 25th Street, City of Indianapolis, County of Marion, State of Indiana. The period of performance will be from July 26, 2010 through December 30, 2010. Requirements for TO #18 include the following: 1) Develop and implement a site health and safety plan; 2) Develop an Urban Ag site located at 1100 E. 25th Street, Indianapolis, IN by grading and contouring soil previously brought into the site. Contractor shall utilize drawings provided by Federal Representative to determine where to locate soil; 3) Demolish a building structure not associated with task #2 located in Indianapolis, IN and properly dispose of material.  Site shall be graded, backfilled and seeded.  Site address to be given by Federal Representative.  4) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA" or "the Act") contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's ERRS (Emergency and Rapid Response Services) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive  for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing ERRS contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing ERRS contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.

<DESC>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) intends to negotiate a sole source acquisition with Stanford University for membership for the National Performance of Dams Program. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302, circumstances permitting other than full and open competition. This procurement action will result in a firm-fixed price purchase order for one base year and 4 option years. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. Membership includes the following: <br />&bull; Annual meeting on new and ongoing research,<br />&bull; Access to the performance of dams library and database, including staff support and document reproduction,<br />&bull; Advance copies of research reports, papers and other publications issued by Stanford Center on the Performance of Dams projects, and<br />&bull; Site visits by Stanford faculty to present lectures and seminars and to hold individual conferences.
<p>No solicitation document is available. The FERC will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 5 calendar days after publication of this notice.</p>
<p>Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the Government to switch providers for this requirement. A request for information will not be considered an affirmative response.</p>
<p>If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Stanford University. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to show the Government's intent to award sole source to Hewlett Packard.&nbsp; Please see justification for this action below:
<p>Relocation of GFE one (1) Hewlett Packard Rack containing c7000 blade enclosure and EVA4400 from Mechanicsburg, PA to Houston, TX for integration and then to Hill AFB, UT. DISA expects an Hewlett Packard representative to verify and de-install the GFE equipment in preparation for the physical relocation. An Hewlett Packard representative will document the information necessary to reconnect and reconfigure the equipment at the new location. DISA expects an Hewlett Packard representative will disassemble, disconnect, de-rack, if necessary, and prepare the equipment for transport to the new location. DISA assumes equipment not covered by Hewlett Packard Support or Hewlett Packard warranty will be inspected for visual physical damage at the current equipment location and tested for minimum functionality prior to de-installation. DISA expects an Hewlett Packard representative to package as necessary, transport and deliver the equipment to the new location. Upon delivery to the new location, DISA expects an Hewlett Packard representative will re-install the equipment. Reinstallation services include equipment assembly, re-racking, completion of necessary cable connections, power-on, re-booting equipment to its initial prompt, and changing IP addresses if necessary. Verification testing is provided for equipment under Hewlett Packard Support or Hewlett Packard warranty. Minimum functionality tests will be performed for the equipment not covered by Hewlett Packard Support or Hewlett Packard warranty.</p>
<p>Award to any other source other than Hewlett Packard&nbsp; would void hardware warranty currently held on these boxes and void the certification of the SAP software currently running on the appliance.&nbsp; This delay would have a significant impact on the national security, as this EBS system manages and controls the flow of materials and services to the warfighters. Further delay of this installation would result in scheduling conflicts and delay of other project implementations which could impose negative impacts to the EBS environment. Lastly, the investment of an estimated $551K would be lost.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as stated in items above this hardware will need to be delivered and installation within a 21 day period after award.<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to contact the point of contact above.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Region 4 plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Johnsons Controls, Inc. to procure BAS upgrades for the monitoring and updating of the sequence of operations for the existing Johnson Controls "Metasys NCM" building automation system for the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center (AFC) Complex located in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government believes that only one source is capable of providing the aforementioned installation/upgrade because of the proprietary nature of the existing equipment/systems installed.

Additionally it is protected with patent infringement rights dealing with intellectual property.</p>
<p>Under this procurement, GSA will issue specific requirements and deliverables through the anticipated Contract Award. Based on the Award, the contractor shall provide a combination of products and services to modify the existing controls at the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Ctr. Complex. This notice of intent is NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to Takish Brown at the office identified above or by e-mail at takisha.brown@gsa.gov, which establishes that their specifications meet the Requirement of this project, 7 days from the date of this announcement. A determination not to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is for informational purposes only and not to be construed as a commitment by the government. Any information submitted to this notice of intent is voluntary.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If during the term of the contract, the TFS's exceed the NTE amount, the contractor may submit a request for equitable adjustment (REA). The REA must document what TFS(s) changed to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued to establish a new NTE amount based upon the newly documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation.<br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>PART 3 - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT <br />3. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES <br />3.1. The FDA, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Vaccine Research and Review (OVRR), Division of Bacterial, Parasitic, and Allergenic Products (DBPAP) requires the calibration and maintenance of pipettes. Pipette calibration and maintenance supports the regulatory mission of the DBPAP. DBPAP is seeking ISO 17025:2005 accreditation for some test methods. The pipettes used to support these methods must be calibrated in compliance with ISO 17025:2005, whereas, pipettes used to support research require less rigorous calibration. There is a need for two levels of pipette calibration. Level 1 (research) calibration includes preventative maintenance, assessments using manufacturer specifications, and documentation by at least a calibration. Level 2 calibration include accuracy and precision assessments for &lsquo;As found' and &lsquo;As left', and preventative maintenance. Documentation of Level 2 (ISO 17025) calibration service consists of a calibration sticker and a calibration certificate. The calibration certificate includes all but not limited to the following: &lsquo;As found' and &lsquo;As left' data, environmental conditions at the time of calibration, accreditation body logo, NIST traceable equipment used to perform calibration, date calibration performed, maintenance performed, service person, and pass or fail assessment. Preventative maintenance is performed according to manufacturer's instructions and can include inspection; cleaning; replacement of Teflon seals, if appropriate; replacement of defective parts, and adjust the calibration. Personnel who perform the calibration must be adequately trained to be able to calibrate and maintain a wide-variety of manufacturers' pipettes including manual and electronic models. Due to the extensive number of pipettes that require service, calibration must be performed on-site within the NIH Building 29-complex (29 Lincoln Drive, Bethesda, MD).</p>

All equipment must be new; used and/or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.<br />All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, Fiber-coupled Spectroradiometer System that shall meet or exceed the following required specifications:</p>
<p><br />1. The spectroradiometer shall be able to measure the spectral radiance and irradiance of a user's external light source (not included) and record data electronically.</p>
<p>2. The spectroradiometer shall have a spectral range covering at least 350 nm to 2400 nm.</p>
<p>3. The spectral resolution shall be 5 nm or smaller at 700 nm, 10 nm or smaller at 1400 nm and 10 nm or smaller at 2100 nm.</p>
<p>4. The spectral sampling interval shall be 2.5 nm or smaller in the 350 nm to 1000 nm range, and 5 nm or smaller in the 1000 nm to 2500 nm range.</p>
<p>5. The spectroradiometer shall be fast enough to record an entire spectrum in 0.1 seconds.</p>
<p>6. The spectroradiometer shall come equipped with at least one fore&#8208;optic for radiance, with a fov between 1 degree (full angle) and 8 degrees (full angle). Stronger consideration will be given for additional radiance fore&#8208;optic attachments having different fields&#8208;of&#8208;view. The preference is for radiance fore&#8208;optics with fov's of 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and 8 degrees.</p>
<p>7. The spectroradiometer shall come equipped with at least one cosine collector fore&#8208;optic for irradiance.</p>
<p>8. There may be multiple input configurations to the spectroradiometer. One optical input to the spectroradiometer shall be a single fiber&#8208;optic bundle cable having an input of 25 degrees full conical angle, and a length greater than 1 meter. The final tip end of the fiber ferrule shall have a diameter less than or equal to 0.125".</p>
<p>9. The fiber optic input probe end ferrule shall be sized to fit into SMA&#8208;905 fiber adapters.</p>
<p>10. The spectroradiometer shall have a radiance calibration referenced to the 25 degree bare fiber input, and be capable of reporting this in Watts per square meter, per steradian, per nanometer.</p>
<p>11. The noise equivalent delta spectral radiance, in units of nanoWatt per square centimeter, per nanometer, per steradian, referenced to the input of the bare fiberoptic cable, shall be less than 1.5 at 700 nm, less than 2.5 at 1400 nm, and less than 5 at 2100 nm. Stronger consideration shall be given if the detectors in the instrument are temperature stabilized.</p>
<p>12. The spectroradiometer dynamic range shall be such that it is capable of measuring, without saturating the detectors, the solar radiance at zero zenith angle from a 100% reflectance Lambertian surface in clear sky conditions.</p>
<p>13. The spectroradiometer shall be capable of being powered from a 110 VAC/60 Hz outlet.</p>
<p>14. The spectroradiometer shall weigh less than 10 kg.</p>
<p>15. The spectroradiometer, excluding any power supply or control computer, shall include an Ethernet interface to a controller computer.</p>
<p>16. Software for interactive control and data acquisition from the spectroradiometer, compatible with the Windows XP operating system, shall be included. The need for Windows XP is based on Windows XP being the operating system that NIST has a license for.</p>
<p>17. A LabVIEW software development kit shall be included, that includes LabVIEW VI's or drivers that can be installed on the user's computer and called from the user's LabVIEW environment, to enable the user to perform automated control and data acquisition from the spectroradiometer. This software development kit shall include documentation that describes the VI's, or the commands that such VI's would need to send and receive in order to communicate with the spectroradiometer over the Ethernet interface. This documentation shall be in either a printed or electronic format. The LabVIEW software development environment itself need not be included. The need for LabView is based on the fact that LabView is what controls the existing instruments and NIST has a site license for it.</p>
<p>18. A user manual for the spectroradiometer in printed format shall be included with the shipment</p>
<p>19. A re&#8208;usable shipping case, not made of wood or cardboard, shall be included that is capable of holding the spectroradiometer and its accessories securely during repeated shipment. The shipping case shall have wheels.</p>
<p>Warranty<br />The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one year warranty for the equipment. The warranty shall include all parts, labor and travel. The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage for the equipment.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be in accordance with the Contractor's commercial delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested &amp; a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on NOI-RML-10034. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-44 dated 07/08/2010. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 and the size standard is 500. SCHEDULE: The Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Laboratory for Persistent and Viral Diseases (LPVD) has a need for the following: NIKON Evolve, Intelligent, 10 MHz Digital Monochrome Camera with charge multiplication gain capability; Air cooled; TI-U Inverted Microscope and components.&nbsp; LPVD is involved in studying of the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) diseases, also known as prion diseases. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in man. Many lines of evidence suggest that an aggregated, protease-resistant form (PrPSc) of a host protein called prion protein (PrPC) comprises a substantial part of the infectious agent, or is in fact the infectious agent itself, which has been termed a prion. A number of fundamental aspects of prion pathogenesis have yet to be understood including: 1) determining mechanisms by which prions infect cells; 2) identifying where prion replication occurs within cells; 3) determining how prions are trafficked within and between cells; 4) elucidating mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated with prion infection; and 5) understanding the trafficking and functions of the normal host prion protein. <br />Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technique that is the best method to investigate these questions and many of the reagents and methods necessary to study prions by this technique have already been developed. We are using two Nikon microscopes controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software in our studies to perform widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy. To improve image quality and expand the number of fluorophores we can image, we need to upgrade the microscope stand for our widefield microscope. On our Nikon confocal microscope, we need to upgrade to an ultra-sensitive EMCCD camera with precise quantitation capabilities and a faster, more powerful computer to control our confocal imaging system along with its numerous peripheral devices. Delivery of product and all components to Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) following the award must be received at RML by 10/01/2010. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT. Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years (with possibility of extensions)<br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Central Asian Republics, Kyrgyzstan Country Office, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan <br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A) Background</p>
<p>The Regional USAID Mission for Central Asia, located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government's regional assistance program directed at supporting a program of policy reform, humanitarian assistance, economic recovery and development in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The USAID office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan manages day-to-day oversight and management of the USAID program in that country.</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz Republic is experiencing major political and economic change following the overthrow of President Kurmanbek Bakiev in early April 2010, and the recent violence in the South of the country. Kyrgyzstan now represents a country in democratic transition in a region not known for democratic governments. The historical legacy of seven decades of Soviet rule is large. Kyrgyzstan's success or failure in its efforts to achieve successful democratic transition will have long-term ramifications for how democracy is viewed in Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. remains committed to furthering democratic governance in the Kyrgyz Republic and to its long-term stability and development.</p>
<p>USAID program of assistance to Kyrgyzstan includes (a) humanitarian assistance and stabilization efforts; (b) economic restructuring and privatization; (c) democratization; and d) social sector reform. A cross-cutting conflict prevention program for the Ferghana Valley region led to the opening a satellite office in the southern city of Osh in 2005 that will soon be reopened once the security in the South is re-established. Given recent events, programming focused on the South has become a priority.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 to Bruker Optics, Inc., 19 Fortune Dr, Billerica, MA 01821 for the purchase of a Fourier-Transform-Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Bruker Optics, Inc. is the only known source capable of meeting the Governments requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the requirement in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. CST on 30 July 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Christopher.M.Barnett@usace.army.mil. <BR><BR>1. The Environmental Laboratory (EL) has been tasked with purchasing a FOURIER-TRANSFORM-INFRARED (FTIR) SPECTROMETER for interfacing with an existing NETZSCH thermal gravimetric balance.  This instrument will provide invaluable data about the properties of materials at both the nanoscale and microscale.<BR><BR>2.  A NETZSCH Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) unit purchased by GSL is currently being utilized to monitor changes in mass of sorbant samples as a function of temperature and/or time.  TGA gives characteristic information about the composition of the measured sample, in particular the amounts of the various components and their thermal behavior.<BR><BR>3.  The combination of both instruments yields a powerful analytical technique that combines the quantitative capabilities of TGA and the qualitative capabilities of FTIR spectroscopy.  Both systems are controlled from an integrated software package running under Windows NT.  Simultaneous measuring, data acquisition, and data storage with the two software packages Proteus (NETZSCH) for data of thermal analysis and OPUS (Bruker Optics) for FTIR spectra.  <BR><BR>4.  The Bruker's TGA interface is a stainless steel beam conforming gas cell with provides a long path length (123 mm) minimizing sample volume.  This provides an improved sensitivity for the gas analysis due to low purge gas flow rates at the NETZSCH thermobalance, a natural, vertical gas flow around the sample, a heated furnace gas outlet, the shortest possible heated transfer line, and a beam-conforming stainless steel gas cell with a sensitive IR detector.  The cell has double windows to eliminate condensation, and the window assembly can be easily removed from the gas cell for cleaning.  In addition, an optimally designed transfer line and the connection adaptors are included with furnaces heatable up to 230 degrees Celsius to prevent a condensation of the decomposition products within the interface connection.

Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price, technical acceptability, and past performance standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />ATTACHMENT<br />1.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: HSCG38 -10-Q-200158<br />Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-200158 is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-44.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a sole source Firm-Fixed Price purchase order shall be awarded as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. It is the Government's belief that only American Eurocopter Corporation can obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts, required to successfully provide these items. Business concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.<br />Please read and comply with all requirements for submitting a quote. Failure to comply with all instructions contained within this combined synopsis/solicitation could result in the quote being ineligible for award. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure their quote meets all the requirements identified herein. <br />The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The USCG plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order for the following parts utilized on the Coast Guard's H65 Short Range Recovery (SRR) helicopter. This is an unrestricted solicitation.</p>
<p>Schedule of Supplies/Services <br /><br />* Please see attached MS Excel spreadsheet</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), or a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR), Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with FAR clause 52.246-15. The COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. <br />NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.<br />Offers should indicate nomenclature, part number, unit price, and extended price, plus the FOB point, any discounts for prompt payment, business size standards, and minority classifications. Earlier deliveries are desired and will be accepted. F.O.B. Destination is requested as the F.O.B. point for the Deliverables. All offers will be considered F.O.B.

Packaging material shall not consist of the following: popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type or peanut packaging. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate National Stock Number, Part Number, Nomenclature, Quantity, Purchase Order and Line Item Number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling and storage. Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage. Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />Only offers meeting the listed technical capability criteria are eligible for award.</p>
<p>Technical Capability</p>
<p>Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria. Only offerors meeting all of these criteria will be considered for contract award.<br />Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. <br />Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>Offerors that have obtained a pass rating on the technical criteria listed above will then be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1. Price<br />2. Delivery<br />3. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)</p>
<p>Price is the most important evaluation factor, with Delivery being the second most important evaluation factor. Price and Delivery, when combined, are more important than Past Performance.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for requirements listed in this solicitation. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. All offerors must comply with the requirements in section (b) of FAR 52-215-20 found below.</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information IAW the requirements in this solicitation. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009)</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 11 August 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 13 August 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to David.W.Allen@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200158 in subject line.

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Recycled Paper (AUG 2000)<br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision) <br />52.209-6 Protecting the Government's Interest when Subcontracting (SEPT 2006)<br />With Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (APR 2010)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). <strong>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 16 August 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST.</strong> Anticipated award date is on or about 18 August 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), Atmospheric Turbulence Division (ATDD) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, has a requirement for a generator system designed to back up a Solar/Battery Power system for Arctic Regions. NOAA/ARL/ATDD needs to install a remote powered climate weather station on U.S. Forest Service lands near Tok, Alaska, in the fall of 2010 or spring of 2011. This station will primarily be powered by a solar array of four (4) 200 watt <strong><em>(Evergreen ES-A-200) </em></strong>panels <em><strong>(solar charge controller used will be Morningstar TS-MPPT-60)</strong></em> charging a battery bank of six (6) 2 volt 1215 amp hour Concorde Sun Extender PVX-1215HT solar batteries ((dimensions 11.64" L x 6.95" W x 15.73" H) connected in series, for a 12 volt supply. (The solar array and battery bank are not to be included in this quote. NOAA/ATDD will provide.) All components at the station run on 12 volts and have a continuous current draw of 2 amps. In addition to the continuous 2 amp load there is a heater on the precipitation gauge that draws an additional 6 amps about 30% of the time during periods of freezing precipitation. The periods of precipitation will probably be less than 10 % of the time. Due to low wind speeds during the winter period, wind generators are not included in the station design.</p>
<p>This generator system will be used to supply battery charging during periods when incoming solar radiation is inadequate to supply enough charge to the batteries. The requirements for the generator system will be as follows:</p>
<p>1. The generator could run on diesel, propane, or gasoline.<br />2. If the fuel is liquid, the fuel tank needs to have a secondary containment system designed to contain leaks from the primary tank.<br />3. The fuel system should have adequate capacity to run the generator for a complete winter season. Provide rationale for determination that capacity is adequate.<br />4. The generator system needs to be enclosed in such a way to protect it from the environment. <br />5. The enclosure system should have adequate space to house the generator, battery bank, and all charging regulators for the system.<br />6. The system is required to operate in extreme arctic conditions to include the temperature range of -60C to +35C.<br />7. The system should monitor the battery charge state and self start when needed.<br />8. The system will need to be disassembled, transported to the site, and re-assembled by three people. <em><strong>Components should be of a size and weight that would facilitate transport by hand, approximately up to 200 pounds would be acceptable.</strong></em> Provide detailed assembly instructions. (The assembly of the system onsite is not to be included in this quote.)<br />9. The expected service interval for the system should be annually, but infrequent or unscheduled maintenance could be done if needed. Therefore, the system is not intended to be designed with backups or redundancy.<br />10. There is a noise requirement of less than 70 dB at 200 feet.<br />11. The system is to include the charging components needed to connect the generator to the battery bank.<br />12. Provide the footprint size of the design and list the major components, and total weight. Provide a schematic drawing of the generator system.<br />13. The generator system is to be delivered to a point in Alaska to be determined.</p>
<p>The company designing the system needs to (1) demonstrate technical ability that they have experience in designing this type of generator system for arctic environments; (2) demonstration of past performance in providing a generator system by providing references.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to include in writing, the company name, address, phone number, and DUNs number. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated primarily on technical functionality that fully meets our requirements. All technical questions for this requirement should be directed to Mark Hall at 865-607-1737 or by email: Mark.Hall@noaa.gov. The applicable NAICS code is 335312. Response may be submitted by fax at 865-576-1327 or email: Sharon.Conger@noaa.gov by 5:00 pm, Monday, July 26, 2010.</p>
<p>All costs associated with providing information as requested by this notice shall be the responsibility of the contractor. Submission is voluntary. It is required that all contractors doing business with the Government be registered with the Central Contractor's Registry (CCR) and complete the On-Line Representations and Certifications. No award can be made to a company not registered in the CCR. <br /><br /><strong><em>Modifications made on July 26, 2010 are in bold italics.</em></strong></p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the previous combined synopsis/solicitation.  The purpose of the modification is to clarify portions of the specifications.  Also, the response date has changed to allow for corrections to quotes.
Question 1:  The specifications call for a double door eight foot x eight foot, but then it says (two doors 4 foot x 2 foot).Clarification 1:  two 4 foot by 8 foot doors to create one double door opening.
Question 2:  Are the fans to be steel or aluminum?Clarification 2:  As long as the fans meet the specifications as outlined in the SOW (provide the necessary cooling and air movement for this size of greenhouse), either steel or aluminum are acceptable.
Question 3:  Specifications call for "Two heavy duty aluminum fan shutters with motor" are these to be used on the fans or at the opposite end of the greenhouse when the fans are running? We don't usually motorize the shutters on the fans. Clarification 3:  Two heavy duty fan shutters with motor are to be used at the end opposite to the 54" exhaust fans.
Question 4:  Are the "Two interior screens for the fans", screens or inlet guards? If they are insect screens, what mesh of screen is required?Clarification 4:  The screens are inlet guards for safety and must be small enough to prevent fingers from getting into the fans.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation has been amended from a small business set aside to full and open competition.  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.This solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10631 and the solicitation is being re-issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-44.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380 - Testing Laboratories, which has a size standard of $12.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from award of this solicitation.  The procurement is for analysis of up to 860 marine sediment samples and up to 350 wetland sediment samples for radiochemical analysis (as described below).  The period of performance of this contract shall be 12 months from the date of contract award.  Statement of Work: BACKGROUND:  Abundances of naturally occurring, elemental radioisotopes in marine sediments and wetland soils can be used to date sediment or soil deposition in timeframes from days to 100s of years. Radioisotopes frequently used are 234Th (T1/2 = 24.5 d), 7Be (53 d), 137Cs (30 yr) and 210Pb (22.3 yr). Concentrations of these radioisotopes determined in sediment or soil core fractions with depth provide information about deposition rates and mixing. These parameters can be coupled with other measurements to obtain estimates of, for example, organic mater decomposition, organic matter burial, and sediment accretion rates. The US EPA Gulf Ecology Division is conducting research into factors controlling the development of hypoxia (i.e., water where dissolved oxygen concentrations fall below 2.0 mg/L) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Sediment deposition, sediment mixing, and organic matter decomposition rates are all important variables that affect the consumption of oxygen in marine sediments which contributes to the development, extent and duration of Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. Concentrations of 7Be, 234Th, 137Cs, and 210Pb in Gulf of Mexico marine sediment samples are therefore key measurements critical to the success of this research. In addition, the US EPA Gulf Ecology Division is investigating the ecosystem functions and services supported by coastal wetlands in Tampa Bay, Florida. Wetland soil accretion rates are important for quantifying carbon sequestration and ecosystem response to rising sea levels in coastal wetlands. Concentrations of 137Cs and 210Pb in wetland sediment samples are key measurements critical to the success of the US EPA Gulf Ecology Division research in Tampa Bay coastal wetlands. Scope: The contractor shall analyze a minimum of 265 and a maximum of 860 Gulf of Mexico marine sediment samples for 7Be, 234Th, 137Cs, and 210Pb activity and a minimum of 130 and a maximum of 350 wetland sediment samples for 137Cs and 210Pb activity. For the Gulf of Mexico study, there will be 12 stations X 3 cores per station X 8 to 11 samples per core = 288 to 396 samples. The 396 samples will be obtained from cores sectioned in the following manner: (SEE STATEMENT OF WORK AT EPA WEBSITE BELOW FOR TAB LE).
Core diameter is  9.5 cm. EPA will ship approximately 1/2 the samples near Oct 4, and ship the remainder near Oct. 12. For the wetland samples, there will be a minimum and maximum of 130 and 350 samples, respectively. Soil cores will be taken from each of nine mangrove wetlands in Tampa Bay, FL using a coring cylinder with a diameter of ~ 7.6 cm. Each core will be divided into 2 cm increments (i.e., final volume = ~ 90 cm3; mass will be dependent upon bulk density).  The number of samples sent out for analyses will depend upon the amount of time required to analyze each sample. Please note that only 137Cs and 210Pb concentrations will be measured from these wetland samples. EPA will ship approximately 1/3 of the samples in late August, 2010 or a time designated by the Contracting Officer?s Representative(COR).  The remainder will  be shipped in mid to late October, 2010 or a time designated by the (COR).  .  Wetland samples shall be processed within 30 days of receipt of samples by contractor and raw data made available electronically to EPA at that time.  TASK DESCRIPTION: Analyses of marine sediments shall follow established procedures equivalent to those described by Allison et al. 2005 and Osterman et al. 2009. Marine samples will be collected during a research cruise that will occur between September 25 and October 9, 2010.  Marine samples will be shipped to the contractor within two weeks of collection. Marine samples will consist of approximately 70 g (at a maximum for some samples) to 250 g wet sediment. Results of similar analyses for Gulf of Mexico sediments indicate activities might be as low as 0.5 dpm/g sediment (e.g., Allison et al. 2005). Analyses of wetlands sediments shall follow established procedures equivalent to those described by Lynch et al. 1989, Hussein et al. 2004, Graham et al. 2005, and/or Kolker et al. 2009. Wetland samples will be collected between April 2010 and December 2010 and shipped to the contractor within six weeks of collection. Results of similar analyses for Tampa Bay coastal wetland soils indicate activities might be as low as 0.1 dpm/g sediment (e.g., Nawrocki 2001). The contractor shall be responsible for necessary sample preparation and analysis. MILESTONES AND DELIVERABLES: Results shall be reported as the activities (dpm/g) of 7Be, 234Th, 137Cs, and 210Pb in each marine sediment sample. These results shall include activities of supported and excess 234Th and 210Pb.  Wetland results shall be reported as the activities (dpm/g) of 137Cs and 210Pb in each soil sample. These results shall include activities of supported and excess 210Pb. The results shall be provided electronically (Microsoft Excel email attachment or CD) in a form that can be easily copied into other computer applications. The contractor shall provide quality assurance information with each data report sent to the EPA within 30 days after receipt of each batch of wetland samples and 60 days after receipt of each batch of Gulf of Mexico sediment samples. The contractor shall also provide a final hard-copy output of data files (i.e., spreadsheets) for the purpose of quality assurance. A written report detailing the methods used and the results of QA measures shall also be provided by the contractor. Laboratory notes discussing problems encountered shall be included as an appendix to this report. Original records, such as laboratory notebooks and efficiency/calibration curves, shall be retained for at least three years following final report submission, as copies may be requested to be sent to the EPA. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: The basic minimum criteria include the following quality control samples for a minimum of every 20 samples analyzed: (i) one laboratory method blank, (ii) one duplicate sample analysis, (iii) laboratory control reference materials (equivalent to a certified reference material), and (iv) efficiency/calibration curve(s). Analytical precision for standards shall be ? 2% and error between duplicate samples shall not exceed 20%. The contractor shall re-analyze (at no cost to the Government) an entire batch of samples if results of the blanks or standards are deemed unacceptable for the methods utilized. The contractor shall permit QA audit of laboratory and/or data entry procedures by EPA at any time while conducting the analyses (given advance notification). Analyses shall be conducted on a high purity germanium detector or equivalent. For the wetland samples, the 137Cs detection limit should be between 0.02 to 0.1 pCi/g and the 210Pb detection limit should be approximately 0.5 pCi/g. APPLICABLE AND CONTROLLING DOCUMENTS:  The contractor shall provide a written QA Management Plan equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans (QA/R-2)] and a written Quality Assurance Project Plan equivalent to the EPA?s requirement document [EPA Requirements for QA Project Plans (QA/R-5)] for the Project Officer?s review and approval prior to the analysis of samples.

<p>TITLE: Multi-INT Association &amp; Reasoning Algorithm</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement.</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 07-03-IFKA<br /><br />CFDA Number: 12.800<br /><br />DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 8 Dec 2006; FY 08 by 31 Aug 2007; FY 09 by 31 Aug 2008; FY 10 by 31 Aug 2009; and FY 11 by 31 Aug 2010. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is a world recognized leader in the development of moving target tracking and Multiple Source Intelligence (Multi-INT) fusion algorithms.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI has established an in-house Fusion Laboratory for the testing, evaluation and development of Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms. The state-of-the-art laboratory hosts an array of current up-to-date sensor simulations and a large repository of collected real world intelligence data available for use in algorithm development and evaluation. In the past the laboratory has been used in the evaluation of a number of contractor and government developed tracking and fusion algorithms. Algorithms are evaluated using a set of metrics developed by AFRL and their contractor partners. This set of metrics has become the community standard for testing of tracking and fusion algorithms. The laboratory is also used for the analysis of operational data to identify recurring patterns that can be used in the exploitation of intelligence data.</p>
<p>Through the evaluation of current state-of-the-art Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms, AFRL/RI has determined that new methods of data association must be developed to meet the tracking and fusion requirements of the operational community. Lack of persistent surveillance, large collection gap times, and dense target environments (&gt;3 targets per sensor resolution cell) result in ambiguous association conditions in Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms. AFRL/RI believes that augmenting traditional Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms with knowledge and reasoning based association algorithms in difficult tracking environments shows promise to increase the tracking performance in difficult situations. Technologies the laboratory is interested in developing and evaluating for this problem include knowledge based reasoning and learning, abductive and deductive reasoning, context based association and other heuristic techniques.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective of this effort is to investigate and evaluate multiple reasoning, knowledge based, and heuristic algorithms against the temporal and spatial association challenges. Work will include implementation and testing of complete systems, encompassing underlying technologies such as knowledge representation and learning techniques required to provide robust performance. Data used to perform reasoning and context based association is Multi-INT in nature.</p>
<p>Research conducted under this program will include application/investigation of knowledge based, reasoning and other heuristic approaches for association. Other associated technologies required to implement various approaches, such as learning techniques, and knowledge representation and knowledge discovery shall also be considered in scope. Incremental extensions to target tracking algorithms as well as implementations of new kinematic tracking algorithms will not be considered.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks research efforts that provide innovative technologies supporting new hybrid Multi-INT association algorithms that utilize a reasoning approach to account for large gap times, high density environments and large sensor data inaccuracies.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07 - $250K; FY 08 - $1,025K; FY 09 - $1,275K; FY10 - $1,200K; and FY 11 - $1,150K. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $50,000 to $500,000 per year. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>
<p>III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS: All foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.<br /><br />2. COST SHARING OR MATCHING: Cost sharing is not a requirement.</p>

White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:<br /><br />1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a top secret and/or secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to top secret and/or secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Atlanta, GA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Henry Ford Health System, 2799 West Grand Blvd, Detroit, Michigan 48202 for acquisition of 500 isolates non-E. faecium and 500 isolates of MRSA. No other sources were considered because VRSA are very rare (only 11 cases documented in the U.S. to date), and their presence has been largely confined to SE Michigan. Thus, the best place to assess carriage of precursor strains for development of VRSA, and also risk factors for carriage of these strains, is within a healthcare system that has previously documented VRSA within that institution. In order to ensure that the project goals are completed within the established timeline, the each vendor must also have access to at least 250 non-E. faecium and 250 MRSA isolates per year, and must have a collection of previously isolated MRSA and non-E. faecium VRE isolates. Hospitals must report cases of VRSA to CDC. Thus, the potential sources of this strain were identified as those hospitals that had made reports to CDC. Only two hospitals could generate sufficient numbers of isolates and to ensure more adequate representation of strains circulating in SE Michigan, Detroit Medical Center and Henry Ford Health System. Neither hospital alone could provide the number of isolates required for research.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition is to the Henry Ford Health System under authority of 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Procurement and Grants Office, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341, Reference 2010-86020. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov. The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.406-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with &nbsp;Henry Ford Health Services as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. For contractual questions contact Maria Shamburger by email at heg9@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with The Entwistle Company (TEC) of Hudson, Massachusetts to institute a Conversion in lieu of Procurement (CILOP) of the A/S32P-25 Shipboard Fire Fighting Vehicle (P-25).  The requirement is for a total QTY (65) P-25 Conversion Kits. TEC has been the sole provider of shipboard fire trucks for the past thirty years and has made substantial investment to acquire and maintain technical data and tooling used to manufacture the P-25.  TEC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of, and maintains supportability and uniformity of the P-25 for the US NAVY.  TEC has developed a modified configuration of the original P-25 that resolves all currently known obsolescence issues.  TEC, therefore, is the only source with the technical expertise and knowledge to perform this CILOP.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with The Entwistle Company (TEC) of Hudson, Massachusetts to institute a Conversion in lieu of Procurement (CILOP) of the A/S32P-25 Shipboard Fire Fighting Vehicle (P-25). The requirement is for a total QTY (66) P-25 Conversion Kits. TEC has been the sole provider of shipboard fire trucks for the past thirty years and has made substantial investment to acquire and maintain technical data and tooling used to manufacture the P-25. TEC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of, and maintains supportability and uniformity of the P-25 for the US NAVY. TEC has developed a modified configuration of the original P-25 that resolves all currently known obsolescence issues. TEC, therefore, is the only source with the technical expertise and knowledge to perform this CILOP. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a DRAFT RFQ AMENDMENT for the following requirement.
The purpose of this amendment is to change the NAICS code from 423120 to 337127. NAICS code 337127 has a size standard of 500 employees.
Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) has a requirement for furniture including offices, cubicles, and conference room tables being acquired in the Silver Spring, MD area.

Scope: The VA's Office of Information & Technology has approximately 47,383 usable square feet of office space located in the Silver Spring, MD area. There is existing furniture in these locations; however, it will require removal and new furniture purchased and installed. The final furniture layout designed by the contractor with Government input will be agreed on by both parties.  There will be minor construction in this location which will require phasing the furniture delivery and setup.
On Tuesday, August 3, 2010 at 10:30 am EST a recommended site visit is scheduled.  
Questions for this draft RFQ are due by Wednesday, August 4, 2010 at 3:00 pm EST.

<DESC>RECOVERY-This notice is provided for information purposes only.  NASA LaRC awardeda fixed-price contract to Wyle Laboratories, Inc. entitled Sonic Boom Focusing.  Thiscompetitive action is funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). Thisaward results from a competitive selection under the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) Headquarters released NASA Research Announcement (NRA) forfoundational research in support of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD),entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009 under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment4, A.4 Supersonics Project (SUP1) (Recovery Act Funds)  Sonic Boom Modeling.	TheSupersonics Project is aligned with the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD)principles of maintaining intellectual stewardship of aeronautical core competencies forthe nation in supersonic flight technologies and research appropriate to NASAs uniquecapabilities.  The Project supports the Fundamental Aeronautics Program strategy ofdeveloping systems level multidisciplinary capabilities (e.g., airframe design, enginedesign, airspace modeling and simulation) for supersonic civilian and militaryapplications.  The Supersonics Project is a broad-based effort designed to developknowledge, capabilities and technologies that support vehicles that fly supersonic byeliminating the efficiency, environmental and performance barriers to practicalsupersonic cruise vehicles. The Project has identified a set of key Technical Challengesthat are barriers to success for this vehicle type.  This effort will address the SonicBoom Modeling Technical Challenge.Successful supersonic civil aircraft must be capable of supersonic flight over land.However, the sonic boom that occurs when aircraft travel at speeds greater than sound isperhaps the most significant environmental barrier to supersonic commercial flight.  Inthe near term, the Supersonics project is emphasizing understanding and overcoming thisbarrier, both through the development of approaches to reducing sonic boom noise andimproving understanding of the impact of these reduced noise booms.The Supersonics Project is developing technologies that potentially will lower a sonicboom to levels acceptable to the general community.  There is very little data on theeffects of such booms, and the project therefore has adopted a three-pronged approach tostudying the atmospheric effects, transmission into structures (living area of a typicalresidence and a large multi-cubical office environment), and human reaction to thesebooms. The Projects goal is to develop software to accurately predict the location andintensity of these focused sonic booms to help design new supersonic aircraft that willbe acceptably quiet for overland operation.  This effort will seek validation of newsoftware codes by comparison to measurements of actual focused sonic booms, refinementfor best performance, and then assessment for their use with future quiet supersonicaircraft designs (also called low-boom aircraft).

2.	This is a request for approval to issue a Sole Source contract to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the provisions of Public Law 109-461.

3.	Contractor shall furnish all architect/engineering services, management, supervision, labor, transportation, equipments, materials and prepare site for building operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures for project entitled, "Design Build_B500 Create Bereavement Center" as required by drawings and specifications. The estimated value of this contract is $340,000.

4.	The contract shall be issued under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(5) permitting other than full and open competition, and per FAR Subpart 6.3, paragraph 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute. In accordance with FAR 6.302 "Circumstances Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition" this statutory authority is cited as justification to award a sole source Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business contract valued more than $25,000 (simplified acquisition threshold) and less than $5,000,000 (authority ceiling limit). 

5.	This action requires the use of the cited authority in meeting the socio-economic goals established for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The proposed contractor (Target Engineering & Construction, Inc.) meets the statutory criteria, and is registered and listed in the VetBiz registry as a SDVOSB contractor.

6.	Competition was not sought for this acquisition. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(b), a sole-source set-aside is authorized for acquisitions for an amount more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold but not exceeding $5,000,000.

7.	The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the government based on using service estimate.

8.	In an effort to support VA's socio-economic goals, the undersigned conducted market surveys (via both VetBiz.com and the Central Contractor Registration web sites) for qualified SDVOSB enterprises. The contracting officer has validated that the contractor is registered and certified in the VA VetBiz.gov database and qualifies as "small" in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement.  A further review of the list of potentials noted that the proposed contractor (located in Rancho Mirage, CA) met several other socio-economic criteria; among them Minority-Owned Business. All actions considered, no further effort was made to seek additional sources.

9.	The subject project was awarded in accordance with VAAR 819.7007 Sole source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.

10.	Not applicable per line #2 above.

11.	Not applicable per line #2 above.



Procuring Contracting Officer Certification: I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Justification for Other Than

Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) Document
The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 806.304.

1. Agency Identification 

Department of Veterans Affairs (509)

VA MEDICAL CENTER AUGUSTA GA.

One Freedom Way
Augusta, GA  30904-6285
2. Description of Action Being Approved

This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition comes as a result of a request to repair and rewire boiler control panels at Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta GA. 30904. The boiler system is used by the Charlie Norwood Medical Center. During the inspection process the boilers were in an unacceptable condition, this repair will ensure a catastrophic failure will not occur. This repair will protect employees and equipment, at the Charlie Norwood Medical Center, Augusta GA. Request to purchase sole source from Energy Enterprise Inc a veteran owned, Hub Zoned Company located a, P.O. Box 376 Wrightsville, GA 31096. The price is estimated to be $38,000.00 for the complete upgraded system. Energy Enterprise Inc has performed the same work on the original system in June 2009.

3. Description 
The upgrade to the existing system will further improve the safety and compliance of the Charlie Norwood Medical Center. Energy Enterprise has propriety programming software unique to the Medical Center. 

4. Statutory Authority/Authority Cited 
The basis of this JOFOC is the criteria implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-5, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(a) Authority. 

(1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5). 
(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 

5. Reason for Authority Cited

The reason for citing FAR Part 6.302-5 as the statutory authority for this JOFOC is that it is
appropriate in this situation where the agency's needs could only be satisfied by the unique 
supplies/services available through Energy Enterprise Inc.

Application. This authority shall be used, if appropriate, in preference to the authority in 6.302-
7; it shall not be used when any of the other circumstances is applicable. Use of this authority
may be appropriate in situations such as the following (these examples are not intended to be
all inclusive and do not constitute authority in and of themselves): 

(1) When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- 

(i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; 

6. Demonstrate Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications. 

This equipment purchase is a logical follow on purchase to upgrade the existing system.  Additionally, there are no known third party vendors offering this specific wiring. Additionally, this vendor has proven to be a responsible company maintaining a current CCR and the D&B SQR indicates a 1 risk rating which is excellent. 

7. Sources Sought Efforts.

The agency has done a market survey using the FSS Schedule sources, general searches over
the Internet, and CCR database for similar manufacturers. One large company ACCO Engineered System, Inc replied to the sources sought in GSA. This requirement as noted above no other potential sources have been found for the system upgrade. 
Though there are numerous vendors listed under the applicable NAICS code (811310). A synopsis of the requirement utilizing the FBO database, IAW FAR Part 5, will be issued to allow time for other potential sources to be identified. 

8. Determination of Fair/Reasonable Price. 

The pricing for this open market purchase price is expected to be fair and reasonable based
on past cost experience with this vendor.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-2, 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (2) - UNUSUAL AND COMPLELLING URGENCY

CONTRACTOR: INTUITIVE SURGICAL

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: VISN 22 Network Contracting Activity, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as requested by VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHS), will enter into an agreement that requires justification for other than full and open competition.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved: Intuitive Surgical will furnish and assemble a camera head to an existing Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System.

3. Description of Requirement: VA Long Beach Healthcare System is requesting sole source procurement with Intuitive Surgical for a 3DHD Panasonic camera. Estimated cost is $40,000.00.  
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The acquisition is being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2), FAR Part 6.302-2 (a) (2).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This agreement is being procured on a sole source basis because the medical equipment must be compatible with the Government owned Da Vinci Robotic surgical system that was purchased from Intuitive surgical in 2008. VALBHS has a maintenance contract however the camera was dropped by a VA employee, therefore the part is not covered under the maintenance contract.  Intuitive Surgical will assemble at no additional cost to VALBHS.  It is imperative that the camera is replaced immediately, Da Vinci Robotic cannot function properly without the camera and all surgery would have to be cancelled until the camera is replaced and this would jeopardize patient care.  This equipment is the only one that will satisfy all of the VA's requirements within the time allotted.  

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.   

A noticed was not synopsized/ competed because this is an emergency. See item number 5 above.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost for the Da Vinci Robotic System should be fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and past prices paid for Da Vinci Robotic System.

8. Results of Market Survey: Market research was obtained from GSA/ FSS, and no other company was able to provide the proprietary equipment (camera) for Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System. The Vet Biz website was also researched and Intuitive Surgical is not a Veteran Owned Company. 





JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-2, 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (2) - UNUSUAL AND COMPLELLING URGENCY

CONTRACTOR: INTUITIVE SURGICAL


9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that expressed in writing an interest in the procurement.  See Item 5 and 6 above.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The anticipated life of government equipments are estimated approximately twenty (20) years. VHLBHS plans to maintain Di Vinci Robotic properly in order to maximize usage.  In order to overcome barriers to competition, the Government shall research other surgical equipment before the procurement of a new system. 

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>1. Contracting Agency: Headquarters, Federal Communications Commission, Office of Managing Director, Administrative Operations, Contracts and Purchasing Center, 455 12th Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20554. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1, the following Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is submitted for other than full and open competition, which is based on "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."
<p>2. Description of Action: Based on the approval of this J&amp;A, a sole source purchase order-contract using the Government Purchase Card will be awarded to Creative Management Services, LLC d/b/a MC2, Chestnut Ridge, NY.</p>
<p>&#61558; Description of Supplies/Services: The awarded purchase order-contract will provide for the Pre-show Planning; Exhibit Handling (out and into MC2 facility); Audio/Visual Rental (i.e., 7-flat screen televisions); Labor &amp; Transportation of the FCC Information Booth to be positioned at the CTIA 2010 show March 23rd through March 25th 2010 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, NV.</p>
<p>3. Statutory Authority Cited: 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (i) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>4. Reason For Use of Cited Authority: Use of the authority in paragraph is appropriate when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by (1) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.</p>
<p>5. Efforts to Obtain Competition: MC2 is the contractor who designed and constructed the FCC Information Outreach Booth. As such, they retain proprietary knowledge as to its configuration (i.e., they are owner of the drawings/blueprints) as well as the proper assembly and dismantling. They are responsible for the maintenance and storage of the booth and possess the logistic support teaming arrangements to ensure the booth is relocated to various trade shows throughout the United States with minimum risk of damage or improper assembly.</p>
<p>6. Fair and Reasonable Cost Basis: MC2 provided a quotation for logistic support services provided which resulted in a fixed price quote with an estimated value of $45,006.00. This quote is based on no additional services being required during the event.</p>
<p>7. Market Survey: Based on the unique nature and design of the FCC Outreach Information Booth, any repairs that may be required (from relocation mishaps) can only be performed by MC2. This is because MC2 retains proprietary ownership of the drawings/blueprints.</p>
<p>8. MC2 is the "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements."</p>
<p>9. Other Factors: This procurement action was required to facilitate the FCC Outreach Booth that provides information to the wireless community about the potential impact that auctions will have on wireless licenses and their operations. The booth will also discuss the licensing of wireless systems.</p>
<p>10. Sources Expressing Interest: None.</p>
<p>11. Actions Taken to Mitigate Additional Non-Competitive Buys: None; the unique nature of this requirement can only be satisfied through a non-competitive procurement.</p>

From:  Donyale Smith, VISN 5 Contracting Officer

To:  Contract File

Subject:  Appropriations Law Seminar Justification & Approval

*** Replaces Signed Justification & Approval posted to www.fbo.gov (Government Point of Entry) on July 16, 2010

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:	

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303,  justification and approval for other than full and open competition is hereby approved for the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:

Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 5     
849 International Drive, Suite 275
Linthicum, MD 21090

2.  NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:   

This justification and approval is for the award of a sole source contract to International Training Consortium, Inc. to conduct appropriations law training at VISN 5.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:  

Contractor shall provide two, four-(4) day Appropriations Law Seminars (Fundamental Training) in an undetermined location in the Linthicum, Maryland area on August 16-19, 2010 (Session 1) and October 25-28, 2010 (Session 2).  Estimated number of attendees for each training session is 30.  Objective of the seminar is to increase attendee's knowledge of Federal Appropriations Law as related to their scope of work within the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Training must be tailored to the Federal Government and be specific to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Contractor shall provide students/participants with an analytical framework for identifying and resolving appropriations law issues that arise within the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The total contract value is $23,900.
Contractor shall provide course materials for each student, and students will keep this course material.  In addition, four (4) Principles of Appropriation Manuals and any corresponding CDs, etc. will be provided for issuance to the facility Chief, Fiscal Service, and the VISN 5 Chief Financial Officer.  

Training certificates from the vendor shall be provided to each student upon completion of the seminar.  

Course Outline:  At a minimum, course outline shall include the entire following five (5) core areas listed below:  

1.  Anti-Deficiency Act
2.  Bona Fide Needs Rule
3.  Multi-Year Contracting
4.  Obligating and Disbursing Funds
5.  VA's Appropriations (train participants on the purposes and principles of federal fiscal law as it relates to the VA)

4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:

The requirement was procured under Public Law 109-461, as codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128 and in accordance with FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or Required by Statute). Furthermore, the requirement was procured in accordance with Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulations (VAAR) 819.7007 (Sole Source Awards to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns).

5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  

Pursuant to Public Law 109-461, and as codified in 38 U.S.C. 8127(b), contracting officers may use noncompetitive procedures (including sole source awards) in acquisitions for an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold to make awards to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB).
Pursuant to VAAR 819.7007, a contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided: (1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million; (2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5; (3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and (4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. As stated in VAAR 819.7007(b), the contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer and a determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.
The contractor, International Training Consortium, Inc. (ITC), is a registered SDVOSB, as verified at http://www.vetbiz.gov.




6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  

No effort to solicit potential sources was done, since this acquisition was done as a sole-source contract award to an SDVOSB under  Public Law 109-461, as codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128, in accordance with FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or Required by Statute), and in accordance with VAAR 819.7007.

7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: 

VISN 5 has reviewed the contractor's pricing proposal and determined that the total contract value of $23,900 is fair and reasonable.

8.  MARKET RESEARCH: 

VISN 5 posted a Sources Sought notice on the Government Point of Entry at Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) on May 27, 2010, inviting companies to submit capability statements for the Appropriations Law training.  Multiple sources were identified, including ITC, an SDVOSB. Based on the response to the sources sought announcement and a review of the capabilities of the only SDVOSB that responded to the announcement, the contracting officer determined to make a sole source award based on the authority contained in VAAR 819.7007.

9.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT:  N/A

10.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A

11.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN: 

This will be a one-time training funded by VISN 5. No future competitions for this type of training are contemplated at this time.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: 

I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
