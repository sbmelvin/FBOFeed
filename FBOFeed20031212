The SFW consists of a SUU-66/B tactical munitions dispenser, which houses 10 BLU-108/B submunitions.

Each projectile contains an explosively formed penetrator warhead and a two-color infrared sensor.  The SFW is stored and transported as an all up-round in the CNU-411A/E container.  This solicitation for the eighth Full Rate Production (FRP) annual buy will consist of the procurement of 350 full-up CBUs and data.

<DESC>The Contracting Office, Edwards AFB, California plans to offer the privatization of utility systems (electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater) at Edwards AFB, California located primarily within Kern County, approximately 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles, California. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. The statute requires that privatization must reduce the Air Force’s life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services. All privatization projects will be supported by an economic analysis based on accepted life-cycle costing procedures that demonstrate the long-term economic benefit and reduced long-term costs. If the economic analysis determines that privatization is uneconomical, a contract will not be awarded, and proposal costs will not be paid. The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems.  ELECTRIC _ There are (19) 34.5 - 12.47kV substations and (5) 34.5 – 4.16kV or 480V substations at 16 locations throughout the base.  One to twelve circuits feed radially outward from each substation. Each circuit has ties with one or more other circuits at switching stations as well as the substations. Electric power is distributed on approximately 255 miles of base owned overhead lines and 96 miles of overhead distribution line owned by others and not included in the solicitation. An additional Approximately 22 miles of primary distribution system is under ground cable in conduit.  Buried conduits are typically concrete encased, approximately 30-inches deep, in dry sand or gravelly sand. The electric distribution system also includes three-phase and single-phase transformers, utility poles, lighting towers with fixtures, line reclosers, switches, utility vaults, capacitor banks, and meters. Overall, the system inventory yields a calculated Replacement Cost New (RCN) value of approximately $226,495,400. Based on an estimate of installation dates and useful life for this equipment, the Replacement Cost New Less Depreciation (RCNLD) is approximately $42,551,000. NATURAL GAS_ The natural gas is distributed throughout Edwards AFB through underground polyethylene (PE) pipelines.  Most of the natural gas system was replaced in the 1990s. The distribution system is a radial feed with a main pipeline and lateral taps to serve the buildings.  Isolation valves are installed along the pipe to allow portions of the system to be isolated and removed from service. The natural gas distribution system consists of approximately 138,000 linear feet (lf) of piping, including mains and service connections. The natural gas system also includes valves, service regulators (but no pressure regulating stations), and meters. The system inventory yields a calculated RCN value of approximately $5,125,000. Based on an estimate of installation dates and useful life for this type of equipment, the calculated RCNLD is approximately, $7,067,000. WATER_ Edwards AFB obtains potable water from two primary sources: AVEK Water Authority and groundwater from on-Base wells. There are two independent water distribution systems at Edwards AFB. One of the systems serves the Main Base, North Base, and South Base areas. The other system serves the AFRL. Three well fields furnish potable water to Edwards AFB. The South Base and Main Base areas draw water from two southern supply fields (South Base and South Track). The AFRL area draws water from the AFRL supply field. The southern supply fields provide approximately 55% of the Main Base and South Base water demand. The AFRL supply field provides approximately 30% of the AFRL water demand. There are 16 pump stations on Edwards AFB. Most of the pump stations lift water to storage tanks or modify static pressure in a portion of the water system. The water distribution lines consist of approximately 373,000 linear feet (lf) of asbestos cement (AC), cast iron (CI), steel, concrete, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) mains and service laterals. The water system also includes main line valves (gate valves), service valves, valve pits, manholes, fire hydrants, wells, treatment facilities, pump stations, and elevated and ground storage facilities. The system inventory yields a calculated RCN value of approximately $104,977,000. Based on an estimate of installation dates and useful life for this type of equipment, the calculated RCNLD is approximately, $18,317,000. WASTEWATER_ The wastewater utility system at Edwards AFB provides wastewater collection, onsite treatment, and onsite disposal of treated wastewater and sludge for all Base facilities. Two independent wastewater systems exist on the Base. The first wastewater system serves the Main Base, North Base and the South Base areas. The second wastewater system serves the AFRL. The Main Base wastewater system components include gravity collection pipes, force main lines, six lift stations, wastewater treatment facility, evaporation ponds, and reclaimed water system. The AFRL system consists of gravity collection pipes and a 50,000 gallons per day wastewater treatment facility. Both wastewater treatment plants produce a tertiary effluent. The effluent is recycled for irrigation use on Base during the summer months and discharged to evaporation ponds for disposal during the winter months. The wastewater system consists of approximately 227,000 linear feet (lf) of collection mains and services, 12 lift stations, and manholes. Most of the pipelines are vitrified clay. The system inventory yields a calculated RCN value of approximately $107,452,000. Based on an estimate of installation dates and useful life for this type of equipment, the calculated RCNLD is approximately $50,598,000. The Contractor(s) will be required to manage, control and perform its operations, maintenance, repairs, replacements and incidentals of its utility system(s) to provide firm, reliable and dependable utility service to each Government or tenant connection within the service area 24 hours each and every day. The utility systems will be conveyed by way of a Bill of Sale upon award of contract(s) and real property interests will be granted in the form of a Right-of-Way. The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award. The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Prospective Price Redetermination Utility Services Contract(s) for a term of 50 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist. This requirement is unrestricted. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.

<DESC>Offshore Petroleum Discharge System(s) (OPDS) consisting of U.S.-flag self-sustaining vessel(s) and associated equipment for the deployment, operation, and redeployment of OPDS in support of the Defense Energy Support Center's Prepostioning Program.  This RFP replaces the DRAFT RFP N00033-04-R-3300 and can be found on the Military Sealift Command’s website (www.msc.navy.mil).  It is anticipated that the charter period will be 12-months firm with three 12-month options and one 11-month option.  As part of a preaward survey and prior to acceptance by the government, the Contractor will be required to demonstrate that their system meets all of the minimum technical capabilities, as well as any other operating capabilities, as described in the Contractor's proposal.  Based on today's technology, MSC considers Dynamic Positioning to be a realistic approach to the vessel requirement for maintaining a fixed position and deploying hose.  Considering the sea state (wind and current) parameters set up for deployment and operation, MSC is skeptical that mooring is an acceptable solution.  However, with proper justification and documentation MSC will consider alternate methods.  Your attention is drawn to Part I, Box 18, which asks that you provide the end of charter purchase price for the vessel(s) and hose system(Note: This option may be exercised at the Government's sole discretion) and that you provide any fees required, should the Government not exercise any option.

<DESC>This requirement in support of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, is a combined synopsis/ solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this requirement issued as a request for quotation is N00253-04-Q-0041.  The solicitation document incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-17.  The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 332999 and a size standard of 500.  The contract line items are:  CLIN 0001:  Design, Fabricate and Install Rigid Steel Support Assemblies,  Quantity 6 Each.  CLIN 0002:  Design and Manufacture Vibration Test Fixture for MK 54 Torpedo, Quantity 1 Each.  Following are the minimum specification requirements for CLIN 0001:   General Description: Design, fabricate, and install 6 each rigid steel support assemblies that will interface to the existing shaker trunnions and the existing steel masses of the 3-axis vibration system. This system consists of 3 each Ling Model 2016 Electromagnetic Shakers, mounted and connected to the Baughn Model 3VTS/48/L335 3 Axis Vibration Test System. The three Ling shakers that are used in this system are mounted mutually perpendicular to one another. The steel masses are used to both anchor the shakers and the vibration table assembly. Objective: The design objective is to form a combined reactive structure that will distribute the resultant forces to the seismic mass in the floor. These supports must also minimize trunnion resonances that may be readable on the resp onse accelerometers of the test system and interfere with system control. Requirements: The stiffener assemblies/installation will consist of the following: 1.  Rigid welded steel tubing and/or I beam construction 2.  6 each assemblies that interface the shaker trunnions and the steel masses of the 3-axis vibration system. 3.  Heavy duty thick steel interface plates for proper distribution of loads. 4.  Mounting locations that allow the assemblies to be fastened to the existing equipment with large oversized hardware. 5.  Drilling and tapping of the existing equipment to interface the new stiffener assemblies. 6.  Installation of the assemblies and inspection of the newly configured system to make sure that all is a rigid and well functioning assembly. This stiffener system must be one that will provide more than enough rigidity for the shaker trunnion assemblies and ac t as one solid and integrated structure. There are no drawings available for the upgraded Ling shakers or the 3-axis vibration system; therefore all measurements must be made on site at Subase Bangor building 5945. Since each shaker is mounted in a different location and orientation, it is anticipated that each support will be unique. It is critical that the new shaker supports correctly align and position the shakers. The shakers must be positioned to allow the table to travel through its entire range of motion and must therefore be aligned exactly with the table axis. The supports must also position the shaker in its mid-stroke position while the table is in its mid-stroke position.  The stiffener system must also be thoroughly inspected using precision CMM and standard inspection methods by qualified quality control personnel to assure proper interfacing with the shakers and  steel masses. The manufacturer must have extensive knowledge and experience with shaker systems, and vibration fixtures. All welding must be performed by welders qualified for A36 Mild Steel, Section IX of the ASME Code, and Structural Steel Welding Code, Section 5, Part C or D of ANSI/AWS D1.1.  All design for these supports shall also be analyzed using NASTRAN or equivalent to assure that the finished product meets our specifications. Prior to any manufacturing, detailed layout drawings shall be submitted for approval to the government.   Delivery of the drawings shall be 4 weeks from date of contract award.  It is anticipated that 2 weeks will be required for Government review of the drawings.  Delivery is required 8 weeks after drawing approval. Maintainability:  The stiffener system shall be designed to minimize system disassembly and downtime when performing preventive  maintenance by a skilled technician. The design shall allow for any shaker or the vibration table assembly to be easily disconnected such that technicians can move them as necessary for maintenance. Following are the minimum specification requirements for CLIN 0002:  The purpose of the test fixture is to allow vibration and thermal testing of fore-body components of the MK 54 torpedo. Due to the technical nature of 3-axis vibration testing, candidates should have a breadth of experience in environmental test fixture design, including 3-axis vibration fixture design and thermal cycling. Candidates should also be familiar with torpedo component functions and how individual electronic packages interact with other torpedo components.   Configuration:  1.  Items to be tested are described in drawing 7019304, specifically two each of the Control Group Assembly (CGA), Processor G roup Assembly (PGA) and the Forward Analog Interface (FAI) card which is part of the Analog Nose Array (ANA) assembly. 2.  The fixture shall be mountable to a flat- solid shaker table via 3/8” bolts with 2 ¾”centers, within a 44”x 44” envelope. The mounting surface  3.  The fixture must allow all test items identical orientation; i.e. all axes on the CGA will have an identical directional vector corresponding axis on PGA and the FAI card Requirements: 1.  The test items will be enclosed by a climatic conditioning box such that temperature conditioned air may be routed into the box and over the individual test items and returned to the air chamber.  Thermal insulation should be utilized to prevent heat transfer from the fixture into adjacent test equipment. The box should be air tight in a manner that allows the humidity to be controlled. 2.  The fixture shall allow control led vibration input from three orthogonal axes to be transferred to the individual test items. No vibration modes from the fixture shall induce amplified vibrations into the test items. All harmonics with an excitation factor greater than 1 shall be damped via damping built into the fixture. 3.  The maximum weight of the fixture and all components less the test items shall not exceed 200lb. The test items shall be mounted in a manner such that all fastened points when mounted in the torpedo are utilized when mounting to the fixture. 4.  Wiring/Connectivity: while mounted in the fixture all electrical connecters of the test items shall be accessible such that during testing transmission cables may be connected to external sources and to adjacent test items. Vibration level: The fixture will be vibrated from 0Hz to 2000Hz at amplitude of 5g rms. Thermal level: Items will be t emperature cycled between -40 to 140&#730;F; target time for temperature cycle is 1hour. The fixture is expected to be of welded joint construction with the material being Magnesium or Aluminum.  The welding should be performed by a welder certified to MIL-STD-1595A for magnesium welding and have passed qualification tests for Copper Alloy 110 to A36 Mild Steel, Section IX of the ASME Code, and Structural Steel Welding Code, Section 5, Part C or D of ANSI/AWS D1.1. Delivery of CLIN 0001 to be within 8 weeks after drawing approval.   Delivery of CLIN 0002 to be within 8 weeks after date of contract award.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is soliciting offers from organizations with the expertise to undertake targeted research essential to the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and preventive measures for emerging infectious diseases, including bioterrorism agents.  The emphasis is to cover agents found at the NIAID Category A, B & C Priority Pathogens website.  This list is a subset of the NIAID List of Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases 2003.  

The statement of work for this effort is divided into six Parts: A) In vitro screening, B) Clinical isolate panels, C) Small animal models, D) Non-human primate models, E) Safety/toxicology and immunogenicity testing of vaccines, and F) Safety/toxicology and pharmacology testing of therapeutics.  These Parts will provide a ready capacity in a number of needed areas and will be utilized as products become available for testing.  Test articles that are found to have activity in Part A may progress through development using contractors from other parts.  

It is anticipated that multiple contract awards will be made for each part of this Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) solicitation.  After the basic contract awards are made, task orders will be competed in accordance with FAR Part 16.505 under Parts A, B, C, D, E or F based on the specific requirements of the task order.  The RFP contains one sample task order for each of these six parts for evaluation purposes.  In response to this RFP, potential Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of the six Parts described above.  For Parts A and B, Offerors should propose as many organisms or groups of organisms as possible.  Within Parts C and D, Offerors may submit proposals for one or more of the models using the same organisms/disease or models for more than one organism/disease.  Offerors for Parts E and F should propose comprehensive services to cover all aspects of the Statement of Work.  All Offerors that receive a contract award are eligible for the guaranteed minimum(s).  Offerors that receive awards for more than one Part will be eligible for the guaranteed minimum for each Part awarded.  Offerors that make the Contractor pool and can provide multiple organisms/models within a Part will be eligible for a single minimum for that Part.  The following scale will determine the guaranteed minimum dollar awards for each Part:

Part A	 $75,000
Part B	 $75,000
Part C	$100,000
Part D	$150,000
Part E	$100,000
Part F	$100,000

<DESC>The Stennis Space Center Acquisition Management Office intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price contract to Orbimage, Corporation, Dulles VA. 20166, for a large volume of space-based multispectral imagery of the Earth from the SeaWiFS instrument onboard the OrbView-2 Spacecraft.  The principal objective is to acquire data that is critical for the study of the role of the oceans in the earth's biogeochemical process, especially the effect of the temporal and spatial variability in phytoplankton and their impact on the global carbon cycle.  The data required must be space-based, global in scope and provide full coverage of the earth every two days (excluding cloud cover and low sun elevations).  The instrument that collects the data must be well characterized and sufficiently well calibrated so as to provide for a long-term, stable record of the earth's bio-optical properties.  The sensor used should have a sufficient heritage in the provision of data to the earth science community, including the public availability of data and a strong record of publication in peer-reviewed literature.  This heritage may have been generated on the instrument for which the data are being offered or from another instrument for which there is a sufficient degree of commonality with the current instrument so as to provide a seamless transition in the derived measurements.  This is a Commercial Item Acquisition under FAR Part 12.  The remote sensing data acquired in this procurement will be used by the NASA Earth Science community to conduct on-going global science research.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on December 18, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Solicitation NNS-O-04-07 will be issued to Orbimage, Corporation on December 15, 2003, with a response due no later than December 17, 2003. Contract award will not be made until after December 18, 2003.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The technology is a low-cost and non-invasive liquid level sensor that can be easily installed, operated, and maintained.  The liquid level sensor comprises a single transducer mounted to the outside surface of a storage container. The single transducer employs either multiple piezoelectric elements or mechanical impactors to generate acoustic burst signals with transverse or oblique propagation paths. The transverse propagation path is directed across the tank at the height of the transducer location. The time-of-flight of this echo depends mainly upon the transverse distance (e.g., vessel diameter), the liquid temperature, and the acoustic properties of the liquid. The oblique paths are directed at angles toward the top of the tank so that they reflect off the liquid surface in order to return to the transducer. Accordingly, the time-of-flights of these oblique echoes depend upon the height of the liquid surface above the transducer.  The liquid level, and its precision, is estimated from these time-of-flights using a physical model and rigorous mathematical algorithms. The level of the liquid is estimated by comparing the ultrasonic traces from one or more oblique paths to the ultrasonic trace from the transverse path, and in particular, by comparing the distinct burst travel times from the oblique and transverse paths. Preliminary laboratory studies show a fill level accuracy of 2 to 5%.  The technology is patent pending.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (ECAS): TITLE I, TITLE II, AND OTHER ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING SERVICES TO ADMINISTER, COORDINATE AND TECHNICALLY SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS OF INTEREST TO THE GOVERNMENT

POC:  Ms. Helen Vaughn, Contracting Officer, (757) 764-7582, helen.vaughn@langley.af.mil; Mr. Mercer Hurst, Contracting Specialist, (757) 764-7581, mercer.hurst@langley.af.mil 
DESC:  NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a size standard of $4M.  Air Combat Command, Langley AFB, VA desires to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support environmental programs of interest to Air Combat Command installations and other DoD agencies as requested by the agency and approved by HQ ACC/CEV and ACC CONS/LGC.    The work includes all efforts necessary to manage and execute Title I, Title II, and other A&E services primarily for environmental projects including restoration, conservation, planning, compliance, and pollution prevention.  The work also includes a secondary requirement for traditional A&E Services. 

Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, and preparation of operating and design manuals.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, topographic survey services and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.

Title II services include supervision, inspection and oversight of environmental and traditional construction projects.  

Other A&E services include a full range of environmental and traditional services to include support necessary for the implementation of compliance, pollution prevention, conservation, and restoration environmental projects.  These efforts include planning and programming, program management, scoping, studies, operations support (including data gathering and permit preparation), investigations (including geophysical), evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.  Also included are other related services for the continuation of an existing environmental program or to establish an initial environmental program.  The Contractor shall also provide a full range of management services associated with conventional design for construction of facilities of interest to the government.  These efforts include planning, programming, studies, investigations, interior design services, and other services not associated with a specific construction project.
These resulting contracts are the follow-on to the existing ECAS A&E services contracts.  A&E selection procedures will be used to competitively award seven (7) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Four (4) of these contracts will be awarded as full and open competition.  Two (2) contracts will be awarded as competitive small business 8(a) set-asides and one (1) as HUBZone set aside.  The estimated program ceiling for all contracts awarded under this announcement is $200M.  There will be no individual task order amount limitation within the ceiling.  The minimum order amount guarantee for each contract awarded is $250,000.  
Each contractor must clearly state the choice of competition (full and open, 8(a) or HUBZone) in SF 255 Block 3.  An 8(a) and a HUBZone may compete under more than one category only if clearly stated in the SF 255 Block 3.  Each 8(a) and HUBZone shall submit only one proposal regardless of choice of competition.  Each proposal shall be evaluated only one time.   If no declaration is present, the submittal shall be evaluated under the full and open competition only.  Each contractor shall receive a maximum of one prime contract award.  
Each ID/IQ contract will have an ordering period of seven years ( 2004-2011) .  Individual task order performance per FAR 52.216-22 may extend 36 months beyond the ordering period (2014).  The basic ID/IQ contract will be structured to allow for the issuance of Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF), and Time-and-Materials (T&M) task orders with preference given to utilizing FFP to the greatest extent possible.  The task orders will be used to direct performance of the required effort.  There will be no option periods for the basic contracts.  However, we do intend to use options at the task order level for recurring requirements.   Task Orders may be negotiated for multiple years and options exercised to implement out-year requirements.

Selection of the A&E firms for these contracts will be based on the following evaluation factors that are listed in priority order of importance: 

(1)	Specialized Experience.  SF-255, Block 8, list only current projects or projects completed in the past five years.  SF-255, Block 10 may be used to supplement project information. SF 254 Blocks 10 and 11, and SF 255 Blocks 6 and 9 may also be evaluated to support this criterion.  Specific project experience will be evaluated for ability to support the following requirements:
(a)	environmental quality mission: compliance programs (Hazardous Material (HM)/Hazardous Waste (HW), storage tank management, water, waste water, spill management, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Actions, Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA), asbestos, lead-based paint, PCB, radon, mold (indoor air quality), air), P2, Integration of compliance and P2, environmental management (assistance and evaluation teams, Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ESOHCAMP), Environmental Management System (EMS) pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 13148 and based upon specification in International Standards Organization (ISO) 14001, environmental education and training, sustainable infrastructure and operations); 
(b)	conservation and planning mission: Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), natural and cultural resources, natural and cultural resources plans, Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS);
(c)	environmental restoration mission: Comprehensive Environmental Responsibility Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)/RCRA process, Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA), treatability studies, peer reviews, risk assessments, operations & maintenance, Remedial Actions-Operations 
(RA-O/Long Term Monitoring (LTM), Unexploded Ordinance (UXO), chemical agents, range clean-ups, and low level radioactive waste;
(d)	environmental Title I (design) and Title II (oversight) missions;
(e)	fuel facilities (Defense Energy Support Center (DESC); 
(f)	force protection; 
(g)	information technology (geobase, Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), information management systems); 
(h)	traditional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services; 

(2)	Professional Qualifications of Key Personnel.  SF 255, Block 4 (Personnel by Discipline), should show the entire proposed team by listing personnel from the prime contractor in line B and personnel from subcontractors/teaming arrangement in line A.  SF 255, Block 7, should show brief resumes of key personnel of the firm/teaming arrangement.  SF 254 Block 8 may also be evaluated to support this criterion.  The combination of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to be effectively innovative and contribute to the successful completion of project task orders.  Responses will be evaluated to determine personnel: 
(a)	experience related to work requirements; 
(b)	certification/licensing; 
(c)	education; 
(d)	Peer reviewed journal publications;
(e)	Years with company;

(3)	Past Performance.  SF255 Block 10.  Cite examples of performance and customer satisfaction such as recognition for technical achievements, cost savings, or commendations received by your team for projects similar to those being requested in this synopsis.  Responses will be evaluated to determine: 
(a)	ability to maintain cost, schedule and quality;
(b)	customer satisfaction.  

(4)	Work Capacity.  Within the SF-255, Block 10, each firm shall demonstrate how they will manage, coordinate and administer the work within the prime and among any teaming partners and subcontractors, to include chemical analytical laboratories.   Subcontractors/teaming partners to be included by the prime contractor in their response should be clearly identified as such for evaluation purposes and will later be agreed to during negotiations of any resultant contract.  SF 254, Block 9 and the Continental United States (CONUS)/Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) information requested under criteria (5) to be provided in SF 255 Block 10 will also be evaluated to assist in determining this factor.  SF 255 Blocks 5, 6, and 9 may also be evaluated to support this criterion.  Responses will be evaluated to determine the following requirements:
(a)	ability to manage, coordinate, and administer work within prime and among teaming members; 
(b)	capacity to perform work in-house and with teaming members; 
(c)	ability to support concurrent and geographically dispersed projects;
(d)	CONUS capacity; 
(e)	OCONUS capacity; 

(5)	Volume of Work.  SF-255 Block 10 should clearly identify, in table format similar to SF 254 Block 9, the volume of DOD work, volume of CONUS work, and volume of OCONUS work for each firm/team member and a total for the firm/teaming arrangement.  Amounts should represent the total amount of contracts awarded for the previous 12 months from the date of this announcement.  Note that the volume of CONUS/OCONUS is for all work (federal, DOD, and other).  SF-254, Block 9, will also be reviewed for similar information on a firm-by-firm basis.  Points will be assigned based on ranges similar to those found in SF-254, Block 9.

(6)	Location.  All A&E firms responding will meet the evaluation criteria for this factor.  Accordingly, no one firm will have a geographic advantage under this factor. 

The evaluation board may interview firms who are slated.  Information to be provided will be determined at the time the decision is made to hold interviews.  Prospective firms shall submit two copies of completed U. S. Government Standard Forms 254 and 255 no later than 4:00 PM EST on 20 Nov 03 to:

ACC CONS/LGCE
130 DOUGLAS STREET

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for a maximum of five (5) additional AN/AAQ-24 Infrared Countermeasures (IRCMs) to be used on MH-53 aircraft.  The basis for the sole source is that procuring other than Northrop Grumman’s existing system, who is the original manufacturer of the existing MH-53 AN/AAQ-24 IRCMs, would result in substantial duplication costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  See, FAR 6.302(a)(2)(ii)(A).  The Government has already invested $5.6M (contract and internal Government costs) in installing and testing the Northrop Grumman AN/AAQ-24 system on the MH-53.  Since no other company produces or has the data necessary to produce the AAQ-24 IRCM, any other proposed product would have to be designed to fit on the MH-53 and then completely tested.  These duplication costs would not be recouped via competition.  See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>BBGCON3604S5418
<RESPDATE>010804
<ARCHDATE>01232004
<CONTACT>Marlene Brooks, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-9664, Fax 202-260-0855, Email mbrooks@ibb.gov
<DESC>THIS IS AMENDEMENT NO. 1 TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER BBTGCON3604S5418 POSTED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2003 FOR D - SATELLITE TRANSPONDER CAPACITY ON ASIASAT-2.  Solicitation No. BBGCON3604S5418 is amended as specified herein: (i) Proposal due date has been extended to: January 8, 2004 at 2:00 p.m., EST.  (ii) Due to a typographical error, the Transponder number is corrected to read: 7B.   (iii) The statement under "SEGMENT AVAILABILITY REQUIREMENTS" has been modified to read: Satellite space segment capacity shall be available 99.999% of the time. (iv) The first sentence under "CATASTROPHIC FAILURE" has been revised to read:  "In the event of a catastrophic transponder or satellite failure, the Contractor shall provide another transponder/Satellite C-Band assignment that meets or exceeds foot print and downlink EIRP requirements of the failed service, if capacity is available and acceptable to the IBB."  (v)  The statement under "INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE" has been revised to read:  "The IBB shall be compensated by the Contractor for any interruption in service longer than one (1) minute, to include planned downtimes, and will result in a refund of a portion of the yearly payment directly proportional to the time of the outage, unless otherwise agreed by both parties."  (vi) Question 1 - How many authorized downlink sites currently receive signal from AsiaSat 2 satellite? Answer 1 - BBG has 200 authorized and countless more DTH existing viewers on AsiaSat-2 in the Asia region, especially in China.  Question 2:  What is the typical antenna size?  Answer 2 -  1 meter.  Question 3 - Would another C Band satellite be considered if it was economically and operationally compelling and compliant?  Answer 3 - No, the agency has determined that AsiaSat-2 provides the best means of providing IBB programming to this area.  Question 4 - Would a Ku band solution be considered if it was economically and operationally compelling and compliant?  Answer 4 -  No, see answer to Question 3.  A transponder on AsiaSat-2 is an IBB requirement for this contract.  In addition, the cost to switching to a Ku Band system will be prohibitive, because it would necessitate equipment changes to IBB transmission facilities and all the authorized receive sites and in addition disenfranchise all the Direct-to-Home (DTH) viewers.  Question 5 - Is an alternate satellite offering acceptable as long as it meets or exceeds the existing capacity requirements and the contractor can provide the alternate service with little to no disruption in service?  Answer 5 - See answer to Question 3.  Question 6 -  Can BBG provide the approximate size and model for the antennas in Kuwait and the Philippines?  Answer 6 - In Kuwait, IBB uses a 9 Meter Vertex antenna and in the Philippines the IBB uses a 7.2 Meter Vertex antenna.  Question 7 - Would BBG require any specific performance data to be included with our response?  Answer 7 - Yes, please provide link budget analysis and downlink footprint EIRP counters to confirm the proposed transponder meets or exceeds the parameters currently in use for AsiaSat-2 Transponder 7B.  Question 8 - The solicitation specifies a satellite space segment availability of 99.9999%.  Please clarify this number.  It seems this figure may not refer to satellite/transponder availability which is always lower due to weather factor.  Answer 8 - Our requirement is to lease a satellite transponder on AsiaSat-2 that is equal to or better than that provided with the current IBB lease of AsiaSat-2 Transponder 7B.  The availability of the proposed transponder only refers to the functionality of the satellite itself regardless of weather conditions at the multitude of potential reception locations or other factors that would be considered in a link budget calculation between a single transmission and reception location.  Satellites are typically engineered to a reliability/availability of 99.999%.  The RFP has been amended to require 99.999% Satellite availability.   Question 9 - Would it be acceptable to use the FAR provisions that were included in some of our previous contracts instead of those that the present solicitation requires us to include?   Answer 9 -  Clauses contained the old contracts are included in FAR Clause 52.212-5.   This approach is streamlined under the commercials contract procedures for commercial items.  We have determined this procurement to be a commercial item.  Question 10 - It is required to include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items) with our offer.  As these provisions do no not appear to apply to us, please confirm whether we need to complete a copy.  Answer 10 - It is required that each offeror submit a completed copy of the clause its proposal.   Put "N/A" in those areas of the clause that do not apply to your firm.  Question 11-  CATASTROPHIC FAILURE:  In the case of catastrophic failure, we would like to revise the statement to add "if this is available" to the end of the sentence.  Answer 11- The statement has been revised.  See "(iv)" above.   Question 12 - INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE:  After the phrase "including planned downtimes, we would like to revise the sentence to add "unless otherwise agreed by the parties".  Answer 12 - The sentence has been revised.  See "(v)" above.  Question 13 - Will Offerors be required to have a DUNS Number?  Answer 13 - Yes.  Question 14 -Are faxed proposals acceptable?  Answer 14 - Yes.   PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS, OFFICE OF CONTRACTS, ATTENTION: MARLENE BROOKS, 330 C STREET, SW, ROOM 2527, WASHINGTON, DC 20237 ON JANUARY 8, 2004 AT 2:00 P.M., EASTERN STANDARD TIME.  PROPOSALS MAY BE FAXED TO (202) 260-0855 AND MUST BE SIGNED BY AN OFFICIAL AUTHORIZED TO BIND THE ORGANIZATION.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:  I am confused about the magnet on the probe sheath.  Can you please further explain where the magnet is to go on the sheath and what exactly it is being used for?

A:  The purpose of the magnet will be to hang the thermometer in a strategic place in the kitchen near the stove.  FSIS focus groups say that if the thermometer was "handier" they might use it!  Placement of the magnet on the thermometer would most likely be on the upper top part of the sheath, or any other place that would work out best.  We didn't specify exactly, so it can be creatively proposed.

Q:  The graphic that is to be submitted with the bid.  Are we supposed to design a graphic similar to the one on the website you provided?  If so, are we supposed to put the graphic on the blister packaging or how would you like it submitted?

A:  Yes, the graphic provided is the design desired by FSIS, to help promote the USDA food thermometer campaign.....to increase use of food thermometers by consumers...Ideally, the thermometer should provide as close a resemblance as possible.

The thermometer should look like Thermy™; whether the graphic is placed on the back of the blister packaging is optional.

       area open?  
    A. No flooring required.

<DESC>The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) has a need for program management and oversight office services in support of the Program Management Office and Sector Program Management Offices.  Two solicitations will be issued by the Pentagon Renovation Program on behalf of the CPA.  The first solicitation is for program management and oversight office services for the overarching Project Management Office (PMO).  The PMO will oversee and manage six separate Sector Project Management Offices (SPMO) and is responsible for coordination and integration of the CPA's mission and program objectives.  The applicable solicitation is Number W914NS-04-R-0001 and will be available at http://www.eps.gov/ and http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  The second solicitation will be for Program Management support of the SPMOs.  Each Sector corresponds to a Ministry within the Iraqi government: 1) Transportation and Communications Sector; 2) Electricity Sector, 3) Buildings/Health Sector, 4) Security/Justice Sector, 5) Public Works/Water Resources Sector, and 6) Oil Sector.  The PMO/SPMOs are responsible for Financial Management, Contracting, and Programming (program, project, and construction management). Accordingly, the PMO/SPMO contractors will be required to provide expertise in these areas.  The applicable solicitation is Number W914NS-04-R-0002 and will be available at http://www.eps.gov/ and http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  We expect to post each solicitation by 12:00 pm on Monday, December 15, 2003.  Prospective Offerors should note that the "Ability to Succeed" proposal volume will be due within 2 business days from the date the solicitations are posted.  Draft solicitations are available for advance review (posted as separate downloads).  Questions and Answers regarding the previously posted draft solicitations are also available for download.  Questions regarding the PMO and SPMO solicitations may still be submitted to Pentagon Renovation at IIRO@army.pentagon.mil.  The slides presented at the Rebuilding Iraq Industry Day on November 19, 2003 can be found at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  In lieu of a separate Pre-proposal Conference as previously contemplated, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Policy and Procurement) will be conducting a Solicitation Conference for Offerors interested in contracting opportunities related to Iraqi reconstruction.  This conference will include a presentation by the Pentagon Renovation Program and question and answer period dedicated to the PMO and SPMO solicitations.  The conference is tentatively planned for December 19, 2003 -- additional information regarding the location, agenda, and registration will be available at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  This event is being co-sponsored by the National Defense Industrial Association.  PENREN OMBUDSMAN: For each competitive acquisition, the Pentagon Renovation Program has established an Ombudsman position. The role of the Ombudsman is to provide contractors and other interested parties a conduit to address issues of impropriety on the part of Government officials and other concerns not suitable for a more open forum. The PENREN Ombudsman for the Coalition Provisional Authority PMO and SPMO solicitations is Ken Catlow, (703) 693-5507, catlowk@army.pentagon.mil.

Two Phase design/build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS UNRESTRICTED. The acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition (unrestricted) and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns”.

The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder.  The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods.

The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000.  Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $20,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  Future task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors.  Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price.  Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects.  Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required.  All key professional disciplines shall be registered.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and the ability to do design build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts.  Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options. A significant number of design-build or performance based task orders may be placed under the resultant contracts.  The work under the MACC-III contracts will be concentrated in, but not limited to, Engineering Field Activity Northeast’s 10 state area of responsibility, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.   It is intended to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Quantity contracts encompassing a base period of 365 calendar days and three one year options which may be exercised by the Government during which separate task orders for projects will be placed.

<DESC>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), operated by Princeton University under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, is seeking interested sources to provide firm fixed price and technical proposals to design, fabricate, test, inspect, and deliver one (1) Switching Power Amplifier (SPA) for use on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) located at PPPL in Princeton, New Jersey.  The SPA is also known in the industry as a High Power DC-AC Inverter.  PPPL’s specification is for a bipolar SPA and input filter capacitor to be used in a closed loop feedback system in the NSTX plasma physics research device.  The SPA will be powered by a single 6-pulse thyristor rectifier DC source power supply provided by PPPL.  The SPA Unit shall consist of three independently controlled sub-unit SPAs which can be configured for operation as three independent units or as a single unit.  In all cases the SPA will be fed from the same single DC source power supply.  Each SPA sub-unit shall consist of an H-bridge PWM inverter capable of 4-quadrant operation (+/-voltage and +/- current to load).  A detailed specification for the SPA will be included with the RFP.  PPPL desires to have the SPA delivered on or about May 15, 2004.  This announcement is not an RFP.  RFP 04-007-G will be issued on or about December 15, 2003 and will be available for download from PPPL's public website: http://oorm-1.pppl.gov/public/procurement/.  Proposals will be due by close of business (5:00 PM EST) on or about Friday, January 16, 2004.  Statements of interest or questions concerning the SPA solicitation should be sent to the RFP Coordinator, Sharon Warkala via email swarkala@pppl.gov and must include the Company name and address and the name, telephone number, fax number and email address of the responsible point of contact for this action.  Further information about PPPL and the NSTX project can be obtained from the PPPL public website at www.pppl.gov.

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Variety Ability Systems Inc. (VASI), Toronto, Canada to manufacture externally-powered trans-metacarpal hand prostheses mechanisms and their associated controllers for the Research Department at VAMC, Lakeside Division, Chicago IL. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 339112. These mechanisms will be used specifically for persons with amputations at the level of metacarpal joints and will incorporate the proprietary VASI’s clutch/Brake mechanisms and SPM controllers, modified to meet the needs of the VA. The one-way clutch required must consist of a planetary gear with 5.3:1 ratio in a housing of outside diameter 17.5mm by 5.5mm long capable of withstanding an output torque of at least of 333 oz-in (1.73 lbs-ft or 2.3 Nm) at a speed of 9 rads/sec. The Programmable microcomputer hand controller must fit in a space 1.44” long * 0.637” wide * 0.16” deep.  Features to be included in the controller are a laptop connection and software to modify control parameters and gains of input control signals. The preferred mode of control for this system is a two-site proportional myoelectric control using electromyographic (EMG) sites from intrinsic muscles of a residual partial-hand.   To the best of our knowledge VASI is the only company that has the types of controllers and brake mechanisms required. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements, may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within (ten) 10 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC-GLAC, Building 5, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Variety Ability Systems Inc.

<SUBJECT>J -- Provide Tower Space and Maintenance Services for the NOAA Weather Radio System in the State of Georgia
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS) to negotiate with the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (GPTC), located at 260 14th Street, NW, Atlanta, GA  30318-5360, for tower space and preventative and remedial maintenance of NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at four (4) GPTC owned and operated sites located in Georgia in Atlanta, Chatsworth, Pelham and Waycross.  BACKGROUND:  In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA’s NWR was designated the sole government operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack.  The mandate requires uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Since 1978, the State of Georgia has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and GPTC.  SCOPE:  This procurement is for a follow-on contract for tower space and maintenance services.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The contract to be negotiated is for an 8-month period followed by four 1-year option periods.  SOLE SOURCE:  NOAA/NWS has determined that GPTC is the only contractor that can provide 1) tower space on strategically located towers and allow for placement of antennas at the needed heights to provide the required NWR broadcast service coverage.   2) GPTC is the only contractor that can provide the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year maintenance services since no other contractor can have access to the towers and equipment for maintenance “after hours” due to Homeland Security issues.  Since outages and emergencies can occur at any time day or night, access to the sites for maintenance must be available 24 hours a day. This is not a formal solicitation.  This notice may represent the only notice.  The acquisition is a commercial item acquisition.  See note 22 except 45 days is changed to 15 days for commercial items/services.
