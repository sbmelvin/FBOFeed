Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE <br> TEST ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (TEAS) <br>  <br>  <br> PS-I - Introduction.   <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for Test Engineering and Analysis Services, performed at WSMR, New Mexico.  A five-year (inclusive of option periods) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) single award contract is being considered for this effort.  The requirement is being set-aside for 8(a) Small Business concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $35.5M.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or around 9 May 2014. <br>  <br> Due to the potential for Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI), this acquisition will be conducted using the advisory multi-step process pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  The link to the draft Performance Work Statement will be listed at the bottom of this notice so potential offerors can make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition.  This synopsis constitutes the Pre-Solicitation Notice and Step 1 of the solicitation process.  In this step, potential offerors will submit OCI-Free certification or submit information on potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest that may affect offeror's viability for award (no other capabilities will be evaluated during this step).  The MICC, WSMR Contracting Office requests that potential offerors submit information that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential as viable OCI-Free competitors.  The required submission information is outlined in  quote mark OCI Submission Instructions quote mark  below.  The offeror's submission shall be sent electronically to Mari B. Beckler at mari.b.beckler.civ@mail.mil and are due by 4:30pm MT on 14 March 2014.  Submissions not received by the deadline of 14 March 2014 at 4:30 pm MT will be handled as a Late Proposal subject to the rules in subparagraph c of FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition. <br>  <br> After the Government reviews and evaluates OCI responses, each offeror shall be advised in writing if it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable OCI-Free competitor.  Respondents not considered viable competitors due to OCI issues will receive the general basis for these findings.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), those respondents will also be advised that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their OCI submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.  The invite to participate in resultant acquisition does not absolve the offeror of additional OCI scrutiny and the Government reserves the right to eliminate offerors from competition if conflicts are discovered at any point during the acquisition.  The decision to participate in this acquisition is a business decision made by the offeror and the Government shall not be held liable for excluding any offeror from participation based on OCI determination. <br>  <br> PS-II - Clauses that will be included in the resultant solicitation and contract. <br>  <br> (1) 5152.209-4000 PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PCI). (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE) <br>  <br> The contractor shall not employ any person whose employment under the contract could in any way result in a conflict of interest.  The contractor shall not employ any person who is currently an employee of the Department of Army, military or civilian, to perform work under this contract if such employment would create a conflict of interest or be contrary to the policies contained in this PWS.  In no event shall such personnel be utilized in a supervisory capacity in the performance of this contract.  In addition, the contractor shall not offer a position to any current or former Department of Army employee, military or civilian, who has not first obtained the approvals required by DOD Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and implementing Army Regulations 24.  The contractor shall not employ any person who is a family member of either current contractor employees or current ATEC employees (either military or civilian) without first providing personnel qualifications, supervisory chain, and proposed employment duration to the Contracting Officer for review and concurrence. <br>  <br> (2) 5152.209-4001 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE) <br>  <br> In accordance with Section A - Executive Summary OCI, ATEC requires the Contractor to have the ability to conduct both developmental testing and operational testing without mitigation of potential OCIs.  Title 10, US Code Section 2399 prohibits the involvement of a defense contractor in the operational test and evaluation of its own systems and equipment.  Consequently, all parties must be particularly sensitive to potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest where system contractors are, or appear to be, involved in the operational testing and evaluation of their own equipment or systems, including involvement as a test support contractor.  Such involvement is strictly prohibited. The Contractor acknowledges that it is cognizant of Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2399 and FAR 9.5 and agrees that it will avoid conflicts of interest and, to the maximum extent possible, the appearance of conflict of interest, in accordance with the principles set forth in the statute and the FAR.  The contractor also acknowledges that statutory operational testing and evaluation conflicts of interest arising under Title 10 U.S.C. 2399 and Army Regulation 73-1, paragraph 5-6, may not be mitigated or  quote mark firewalled quote mark  using the FAR 9.5 procedures. <br>  <br> (3) 5152.209-4002 DISCLOSURE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AFTER CONTRACT AWARD. (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE) <br>  <br> (a) If the Contractor identifies an organizational conflict of interest that was not previously addressed and for which a waiver has not been granted, or a change to any relevant facts relating to a previously identified organizational conflict of interest, the Contractor shall make a prompt and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Organizational conflicts of interest that arise during performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award, shall be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of- <br>  <br> (1) The organizational conflict of interest; and <br>  <br> (2) Actions to address the conflict that- <br>  <br> (i) The Contractor has taken or proposes to take; or <br>  <br> (ii) The Contractor recommends that the Government take. <br>  <br> (b) If, in compliance, the Contractor identifies and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest that cannot be addressed in a manner acceptable to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for the convenience of the Government. <br>  <br> (c) Subcontracts.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this special contract requirement, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts where the work includes or may include tasks that may create a potential for an organizational conflict of interest. <br>  <br> Please note, while this first step is advisory, should an organizational conflict be identified before contract award, the offeror may be determined to be ineligible for the award.  <br>  <br> PS-III - OCI Submission Instructions <br>  <br> The offeror's submittal shall be submitted electronically and should include information on any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interests (OCI).  The offeror shall describe their involvement in the development of any DoD System with details including contract numbers, dates, programs supported, a copy of Performance Work Statement to include list of deliverables, as well as contact information for Program Manager points of contact and contracting office points of contact.  Offerors shall discuss any competitions for developmental work in which the company is involved regardless of the stage of the acquisition.  The offeror shall present its rationale for why the cited development work does not create an OCI.  Supporting information for the assertion that there is no OCI is vital to facilitate the Government's evaluation of an OCI.  The offerors will be required to identify teaming arrangements, subcontractor and any perceived conflicts of interest pursuant to Title 10 United States Code, Section 2399, FAR 9.5 and ATEC Policy Bulletin 2-11.  The offeror must certify, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that it is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest (potential or perceived) that impacts its ability to perform Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E) of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) systems.  The offeror must also include the same certification from each teaming partner and potential subcontractor.  Offerors' OCI certifications will be reviewed by contracting officer and legal support and an advisory notice will be given to each offeror.  A Non-OCI certification template is available via the link below; however, offeror's may submit the certification/information in any format compatible with Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office, as long as it includes all of the required information and is certified. In responses from offerors that indicate a potential OCI exists, offeror responses are limited to no more than ten pages. However, this page limitation does not apply to supplemental data such as, independent PWS, etc. <br>  <br> The draft Performance Work Statement and OCI Free Certification Template are available at: <br>  <br> http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Contracting/Pages/default.aspx <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to Provide Packet Transport Component - NATO Communications Infrastructure (NCI). The scope of this project is to transform the largely circuit-based NATO General Communications System (NGCS) into a fully Internet Protocol (IP) converged network. The current unclassified voice system, based on Private Automatic Branch Exchanges (PABXs) will be replaced with a Voice over IP system. The modernised NGCS will support provision of IP communications services to NATO static and deployed users with significantly increased capacity, improved performance, and advanced quality of service.&nbsp;A more detailed summary of the requirements for this IFB is attached.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government will nominate to the bidders list only those firms that have been approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB).</p>
<p>For the performance of the contract, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance and be required to implement the capability on multiple NATO locations in different NATO countries. Prospective bidders are cautioned that the contract award and contract performance will not be delayed in order to allow contractor personnel to obtain clearances where such clearances are lacking. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13735-NCI and all correspondence concering the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 10 April 2014<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued: July 2014</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for: October 2014</p>
<p>- Contract Award anticipated: April 2015</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Synopsis<br /><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit on a sole source basis to Science Applications International Corporation, 1710 SAIC Drive McLean, VA 22102 United States. This effort provides a bridge for continued engineering, technical, program management and logistics support for the modular development and integration on the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). SAIC personnel currently work on integrated teams with the U.S. Navy to design, develop, produce, integrate and test LCS Mission Module systems. In order to keep current with program decisions, the Contractor must be fully cognizant of LCS Mission Modules system testing and installation procedures. Temporary introduction of a new contractor into the LCS Mission Module teams would be counterproductive and require a large learning curve. This effort will allow the necessary evaluation timeframe for the follow-on competitive Seaport task order to occur while preventing a work stoppage or schedule delays.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be cost-plus-fixed-fee beginning April 2014 with a base period of six (6) months and two (2) three (3) month option each. The NAICS code is 541712. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. FSC 7030.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer Kuhn

<a href="mailto:Kuhn.Jennifer@epa.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to award a sole source, fixed-price, purchase order for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), to Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) in order to procure a one-year renewal license for Intellectual Property and Sci-Tech Information on the STN database system.
The EPA requires a 12-month subscription to the CAS STN database system.  CAS is the organization that develops and assigns CAS nomenclature and CAS Registry Numbers for all existing chemicals and is responsible for establishing the CAS registry numbers for all new chemicals.  OPPT requires access to the CAS Registry Numbers to verify the accuracy of pesticide chemical names and structures submitted by parties involved in the registration of pesticide products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  This database system will also allow the Agency to perform data gathering searches used to determine health risks with respect to certain chemicals and the risks associated with chemical structures.  The period of performance will be from March 1, 2014 to February 28, 2015.
It has been determined that CAS is the only know source for the storage of this type of data.  No other source has been located that can provide the quality and robust nature of the data which is necessary to meet the governments requirements.
NO SOLICITATION FOR QUOTES IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. 
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirements as stated herein, may submit a firm fixed price quote by 10:00 AM  ET on Friday, February 28, 2014 for consideration.  A determination not to compete the purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  All questions and concerns should be submitted in writing to Jennifer Kuhn at kuhn.jennifer@epa.gov.

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) wishes to charter an offshore research vessel capable of working in broken sea ice to support a walrus radio-tagging project in the northern Chukchi Sea for a maximum of 14 days between July 12 and 26, 2014.  Actual trip timing and length will depend on the weather and sea ice and the billing will reflect actual charter days.  The work area will be the northeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern edge of the retreating pack ice.  One workboat will be provided by USGS and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska.  The vessel will be required to transit to Nome, or other appropriate ports near the work area, board the science crew, and continue to the work area for arrival by about July 15, 2014.  The estimated location of the work area will be 150 nautical miles west of Barrow, but will ultimately be dependent on sea ice conditions at the time.  The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.  Radio-tagging will occur for up to 10 days, and then the vessel will return the science crew to the nearest suitable logistics base, with a preference of Wainwright or Nome.  The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of up to 9 people working for the USGS, as well as a suitable workboat and boat operator experienced in small boat handling offshore in sea ice.  The size of the USGS crew will be agreed upon at least one month prior to sailing.  The vendor will transport the USGS skiff from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska and return the USGS skiff to that port upon completion of the vendor's season in the Chukchi Sea. The solicitation number is G14PS00197 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72, Effective 30 Jan 2014.  The posting date of the solicitation will be 03/07/2014 and quotations are due no later than 5:00 pm PST on 04/08/2014. The Government anticipates award of a commercial, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  All firms should be registered in the System For Award Management or SAM at www.sam.gov, as well as, the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) or complete FAR Clause 52.212-3 and return with it the quotation to be considered for award.  Please contact the Contract Specialist, in writing, by email at kweske@usgs.gov, with any questions. This requirement is a total small business set aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 483113, total small business set aside, Product service code V224, size standard 500.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earthquake Science Center (ESC), requires the professional, non-personal services of a contractor to determine the suitability of seismic data for inclusion in the USGS database of global crustal structure and subsequently mining it and adding it to the database.
Since the early 1990s USGS has been building a database of measurements of the Earths crust.  The input data are derived from USGS research efforts and from published reports by others.  This database is entitled the USGS Global Seismic profiles Catalog (GSC) and contains numerical values regarding the seismic crustal structure derived from field surveys.  The GSC is intended to be comprehensive, and is continuously being updated and expanded as fiscal resources allow.  At present, the database contains over 13,000 one-dimensional P-wave and S-wave profiles, making it the largest seismic profile catalog in existence.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has requested that additional data be added to this seismic database to assess seismic hazards at power plants in the Central and Eastern United States, and has provided funds for a contractor to carry out this work.  This contractor would assist us in culling suitable data from hundreds of published scientific papers, and mining the raw data for inclusion into the database.  
To fulfill this requirement, the USGS intends to contract noncompetitively with Dr. Gary S. Chulick.  Dr. Chulick has a unique combination of education and experience necessary to advance this project.  He has worked with the USGS (during his summer and winter breaks from teaching at various Universities) nearly since the inception of this database, generally as an invited visiting scientist, meaning unpaid but with travel expenses reimbursed.  In fact, during that time Dr. Chulick developed the techniques involved in mining the one-dimensional data points from the published literature and properly interpreting them for inclusion into the GSC database.  See G.S. Chulick, Comprehensive Seismic Survey Database for Developing Three-Dimensional Models of the Earths Crust, Seismo. Res. Lett., Vol. 68, 734  742 (1997).  Due to his educational background and experience, Dr. Chulick is the only source reasonably available to assist USGS is fulfilling our commitment to the NRC.  
Quotations are not being solicited at this time, and this will be the only public notice of this action.  Other interested parties believing they have the capability to perform this work should submit their qualifications to the contracting officer via email at jcaravelli@usgs.gov before the closing date of this announcement.  All responses will be reviewed to determine whether a competitive opportunity exists.  PSC B517, NAICS 541690, size standard $14.0M.

<DESC>These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The services will consist of site planning, engineering studies, conceptual design, final design, cost estimating, and construction phase services for projects.  The primary purpose of these contracts is to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, the contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.  If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 50.0% to small business concerns; 17.0% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 18.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 10.0% for HUBZone concerns; 4.0% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business; and 8.5% to veteran-owned small business.  The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages.  Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socioeconomic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number <strong>HSCG3814QS00047</strong> is issued as a Notice of Intent to Procure Items on a Sole Source basis. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The Coast Guard intends to issue a firm fixed price delivery order utilizing the terms and conditions of an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), for the overhaul of:
<p>Schedule of Supplies/Services <br />Description</p>
<p>1. Spindle Assembly Qty 3 Each <br />P/N: 70102-28100-055<br />Required Delivery: 120 days ARO and induction at a rate of 4 per month</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>1. This SOW provides for the overhaul to like new condition of the Spindle Assembly, NSN 1615-01-HS1-4258, part number 70102-28100-055 for the US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center's (ALC), MH-60 aircraft. The Spindle Assembly identified in the Description of Items or Services will be furnished to the contractor at the prices on the 2014 Firm Fixed Price List for overhaul. The information contained in the scope of work is not intended to be all inclusive or to detract from procedures outlined in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications except where noted herein. All repair actions shall be in accordance with the OEM commercial repair manuals and Federal Aviation Regulation Parts 43 and 145 or alternate standard approved in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Medium Response Recovery (MRR) Engineering Branch. Components furnished hereunder shall be returned by the contractor in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation in USCG aircraft. Certification and documentation requirements apply.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling repair manuals, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul the Spindle Assembly for the Coast Guard fleet of MH-60 helicopters, as necessary to conform to the requirements of this SOW at the firm-fixed pricing established in the order schedule. The contractor shall provide the data and documentation requirements specified as part of this SOW.</p>
<p>3. The work shall be in accordance with the OEM specifications except where noted herein. The contractor must have access to all needed maintenance, repair manuals and performance/test/acceptance criteria and data to ensure that equipment is overhauled/modified, calibrated and operating in accordance with OEM specifications.</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall also perform a visual and technical inspection in accordance with the current applicable Component Maintenance Manual and correct all additional deficiencies found. This shall include replacement of broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion. Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair the efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas will be accomplished in accordance with the OEM specifications (or best commercial practices if not addressed by the OEM).</p>
<p>5. The Spindle Assembly is a flight critical safety item. Therefore, repair is restricted to only navy approved sources approved by the Service Design Control Activity (DCA). Public Law 108-136 Section 2319 of the Defense Appropriations Act of 2004 and NAVAIRINST 4200.25D state that the DCA shall approve sources for critical safety items and the procurement agency will only procure from sources approved by DCA. Serial numbers for these items are entered into the Coast Guard's Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) for tracking upon receipt at ALC. The ACMS is a computerized system used to record maintenance of aircraft components and assemblies. The contractor's responsibilities with ACMS consist of submission of required forms as outlined herein. All Spindle Assemblies are serial number tracked and shipped to the contractor's facility with a Significant Component History Record (SCHR) and a component repair report (CRR). The contractor shall review the component's attached Significant Component History Report (SCHR) prior to induction for the total number of hours installed since last overhauled. If the installed hours are less than 200, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing for additional instructions and SHALL NOT proceed without Contracting Officers approval.</p>
<p>The contractor shall verify the SCHR and CRR and ensure they correspond to the Spindle Assembly part number and serial number. All discrepancies shall be reported to the Contracting Officer prior to performance of work. The contractor shall complete the CRR. The original copy of CRR shall be mailed to Engineering Services Division, ACMS Tracking, Bldg 78, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001 and a copy shall be shipped with the repaired assembly. The contractor shall maintain a copy of each complete CRR for a period of ninety (90) days.</p>
<p>6. Upon receipt of the Spindle Assembly, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, MRR Supply Cell, in writing of the date of receipt, and shall confirm the serial number(s) of the item(s) received and the applicable order number. Notification by facsimile or email is acceptable: submit to (252) 335-6790, ATTN: Contracting Officer MRR Supply Cell. The email address will be provided by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. Corrosion is expected on equipment to be overhauled or modified under this order. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion on a Spindle Assembly or component thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with the OEM's current specifications and drawings.</p>
<p>8. Replacement Parts. Parts found to be defective shall be replaced as specified in the OEM's current procedures or as otherwise authorized in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center, MRR Engineering Division. In all cases, replacement parts shall be new. The Coast Guard requires Parts Integrity on all items awarded under this order. The Coast Guard utilizes serial number tracking systems for safety of flight items; and places a high priority on parts integrity within those components. As a result, any part that is determined to be in serviceable condition, every effort shall be made to reuse that part from the component from which it was removed. Contractor is advised that in order to expedite deliveries, parts may be transferred to/from other USCG components but serial number integrity documentation is required under this order. The contractor shall ensure that reused serviceable parts' serial numbers are documented as installed on the repaired component.</p>
<p>9. A DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable Tag-Material, or CG-1577-A (11-90), Unsatisfactory Report Tag, will be attached to each Not Ready for Issue (NRFI) component describing faults. The Spindle Assembly shall be overhauled or repaired to correct the specific fault(s) identified.</p>
<p>10. The Coast Guard requires delivery of repaired items no later than one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after induction of the material at the contractor's overhaul facility. The contractor guarantees completion at a monthly rate pre-determined on the 2014 Firm-Fixed Price Repair List valid XX/XX/XX through 09/30/14.</p>
<p>11. At the time of delivery for supplies under this order, the contractor shall prepare and furnish to the Coast Guard a properly completed DD Form 250 Material Inspection and Receiving Report or Commercial Bill of Lading.</p>

The estimated date for release of the solicitation is March 12, 2014.
<p><br />I. Synopsis Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to outline the United States Agency for International Development Liberia Mission's (USAID/Liberia) proposed plan to procure technical services to implement the Collaborative Support for Health System Strengthening (CSHSS) contract. <br /><br />The contract will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee completion contract. The period of performance is a base period of 3 years with 2 1-year options. The estimated cost range for this procurement (base period and option periods) is between $34 million and $38 million.</p>
<p>II. CSHSS Summary</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the CSHSS contract will be to "Improve the Health Status of Liberians", as laid out in USAID/Liberia's Health Strategy, and Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) Development Objective 3 (DO3). This shall be achieved through: 1) Strengthened leadership and governance capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) 2) Strengthened Ministry of Public Works (MPW) capacity to manage water supply infrastructure improvements, 3) Institutionalized Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Improvement (QI) initiatives to improve health care service delivery, 4) Strengthened Human Resources for Health (HRH) Management, 5) Improved Supply Chain Management, 6) Increased financial sustainability of services, and 7) Strengthened Health Management Information System (HMIS).</p>

<p>III. CSHSS Seven Objectives</p>
<p>The Contractor must design and develop, for both USAID and GOL approval, and subsequently implement an integrated contract that supports each of the seven main objectives listed below:</p>
<p>1.Strengthen leadership and governance capacity of the MOHSW at all levels.</p>
<p>The Contractor must design and implement strategies that measurably build MOHSW leadership and governance capacity at all levels, with an emphasis on establishing strengthening external regulatory frameworks for service delivery and pharmaceuticals, and improving management capacity through Technical Assistance (TA) to the CHSWTs in Bong, Lofa, and Nimba Counties.</p>
<p>2.Strengthen MPW capacity to manage water supply infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide TA that supports implementation of risk mitigation efforts required by USAID for the MPW to enter into a direct financing agreement with USAID to finance rural water supply infrastructure improvements. If a direct financing agreement between USAID and MPW is established, the Contractor must provide targeted support to MPW to strengthen internal controls and management systems required for successful project implementation. USAID will be undertaking a detailed risk assessment, developing risk mitigation requirements, and deciding on plans for G2G implementation with MPW during FY14. The level of support for strengthening the MPW on water supply programming will be minor in comparison to support to MOHSW and specific requirements will depend on the outcome of on-going USAID/Liberia efforts to establish a G2G with MPW.</p>
<p>3.Institutionalize QA and QI initiatives to improve health care service delivery.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide TA to support the institutionalization of QA and QI practices as a permanent, integral component of service delivery in the Liberian health and social welfare system. This includes strategies that ensure EPHS and EPSS appropriate quality standards and service delivery protocols are in place, revised and rolled-out as appropriate, that such standards are adhered to and continually reinforced in the workplace, and that workforce requirements and quality standards are met through linkages with continuing medical education and skills development. In addition, the Contractor shall provide recommendations and TA to improve diagnostic services for support of clinical diagnosis and treatment as well as for quality assurance functions.</p>
<p>4.Strengthen HRH Management. The Contractor must comprehensively strengthen HRH management at all levels.</p>
<p>This includes provision of TA and capacity-building support to pre-service institutions, support for the MOHSW training division and service units, funding and administration of scholarships for pre-service training, and supporting the institutionalization of performance-based management strategies.</p>
<p>5.Improve Supply Chain Management.</p>
<p>The Contractor must comprehensively strengthen supply chain management at all levels, through TA to the CHSWTs, National Drug Service (NDS), and Supply Chain Management Unit (SCMU) of the MOHSW to ensure continuous availability of essential drugs at service delivery points.</p>
<p>6.Increase financial sustainability of services.</p>
<p>The Contractor must strengthen and support MOHSW reform initiatives, through TA and capacity-building, for resource mobilization, allocation and utilization to improve healthcare financing and sustainability of services. The Contractor shall develop a targeted, strategically focused approach to strengthen financial oversight, planning, and management functions, at both central and county levels. As a key activity under this contract objective, the Contractor will support management approaches that focus on results through the use of performance-based financing for contracting / purchasing of delivery of health care services. Finally, the Contractor shall provide TA to the MOHSW to plan and manage the transition from free health care to the introduction of affordable user-fees for select services through evidence-based approaches, including piloting of activities that explore financing options for enhancing revenue generation and collection, pooling, purchasing, and financial protection.</p>
<p>7.Strengthen the HMIS.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide technical assistance that supports improvements in the accuracy and use of health information, particularly through process and program improvements. The Contractor shall work at both Central and county levels to institutionalize and strengthen the HMIS as well as integrate or link with other data collection systems, such as the Logistics Management Information System (LMIS), integrated Human Resources Information System (iHRIS), and financial data systems.</p>
<p>IV. Baseline Assessment</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct a baseline assessment to measure a set of composite indicators against which progress in capacity building will be measured throughout the life of the contract. Additionally, results will be measured using this following minimum set of indicators aligned with the National Health and Social Welfare Policy and Plan:<br /><br />&bull; Equity index: ratio contacts (head count)/head in the 25% of population (counties) with highest consumption over 25% population with lowest consumption<br />&bull; Public expenditure on health and social welfare as a percentage of total public expenditure<br />&bull; Number of skilled birth attendants (physicians, nurses, midwives and physician assistants)/10,000 population<br />&bull; Number and percentage of facilities with no stock-out of tracer drugs during the period (amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, paracetamol, ORS, iron folate, ACT, FP commodities)<br />&bull; Number and percentage of timely, accurate and complete HIS reports submitted to the MOHSW during the year<br />&bull; Percentage of execution of annual allocation of the GOL budget for health<br />&bull; Number and percentage of facilities reaching two star level in MOHSW accreditation survey including clinical standards (public network facilities)</p>

However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>FDA is responsible for communicating about the risks and benefits inherent in all the products it regulates. The rise of social media on the Internet, including especially user-generated content such as blogs, forums, message boards, wikis and podcasts, has created new opportunities to interface with the public with respect to emerging hazard situations involving FDA-regulated products. The increasing presence of social media promises new capabilities to monitor the effectiveness of FDA's ongoing risk communication efforts. FDA is in need of both historical and "real-time" monitoring and analyses of a representative sample of social media web sites.</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to provide FDA with the resources needed to use social media to inform and evaluate FDA risk communications. Specifically, the objective is to provide FDA with:<br />&bull; Analyses of social media that provide baselines on consumer sentiment prior to FDA communication and that depict changes in social media buzz following FDA communications; <br />&bull; In-house capability for social media monitoring; and<br />&bull; Surveillance through social media listening for early detection of adverse events and food-borne illness. <br />The scope of work includes social media buzz reports, a social media dashboard, and quarterly surveillance reports related to specific product classes.</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performing of the work as described above and below.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide FDA, as needed, with the capability for 24/7 access to a self-service social media listening and monitoring tool that provides a dashboard with automatically updated reports. The dashboard tool shall enable FDA to create its own reports at any time using near real-time or historical social media data. The dashboard tool shall provide FDA with the ability to run its own queries and refine its key wording to target topics of interest. The dashboard tool shall provide FDA with advanced analytics to produce its own automated measures of buzz volume, trend data, threshold alerts, topic and sentiment analysis, top sources of buzz, and visual graphics.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also provide FDA with standard support to train FDA staff, and make recommendations as needed on how to best leverage the tool's capabilities.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide, as needed, quarterly reports on specific FDA-regulated product classes that identify trends in online consumer conversations about adverse events and/or food-borne illness. The reports shall provide a benchmark for specific products against other products in the same class. The contractor shall harvest, clean, and identify relevant social media messages, and then analyze the content for word frequencies comparing the current time period to historical frequencies to identify trend changes over time. The output would identify new trends, gradual/moderate trends, spike trends, and downward trends. The reports shall be delivered in the form of PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;General Instructions</p>
<p>Responses to the Sources Sought Notice should not exceed 5 pages in length. Responses should be submitted via email to Sonia Nance at Sonia.nance@fda.hhs.gov, by no later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Time, on March 7, 2014.</p>
<p>A complete response to the Sources Sought Notice should include answers to all of the questions below. Please note that a respondent's failure to provide a complete response to a question will be interpreted to mean that it does not understand the question and does not demonstrate the capability to provide the services required. Responses should demonstrate capability, not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g., the response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can provide social media services.").</p>
<p>Questions:</p>

These operations should be available for all visible laser wavelengths and should include the functionality for automated Rayleigh filter, diffraction grating and confocal performance where selected. There should be facility to mount a minimum of four selectable Rayleigh filters. There should be built into the system the following self validation and calibration features, mixed gas calibration lamp, white light for absolute intensity correction and internal reference sample for full system performance validation. Simple motorization is unacceptable owing a lack of feed back for optimized system performance.</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are seeking sources capable of performing the requirements necessary to perform installation of NOAA's Science on a Sphere (SOS) exhibit. This effort requires expert labor to perform SOS exhibit pre-installation planning and design services, on-site collaboration with customers receiving the SOS exhibit, installation services, customer training and exhibit disassembly, as required. The Government is especially interested in responses from SBA certified small business concerns that are capable of performing the work described within this notice.
<p>Science On a Sphere&reg; (SOS) is a room-sized global display system that uses computers and video projectors to display planetary data onto a 68" diameter sphere, analogous to a giant animated globe.  Researchers at NOAA developed SOS as an educational tool to help illustrate Earth System science to people of all ages by displaying animated images of atmospheric storms, climate change, and ocean temperature on the sphere.  By using SOS in this way, complex environmental processes can be explained using a format that is simultaneously intuitive and captivating.</p>
<p>Science On a Sphere&reg; currently is being installed in science centers, museums, universities and research institutions in the United States and other countries.  Installations are numbering approximately 15 to 20 a year and rely on contractor expertise to ensure successful installations.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 712110 Museums and the small-business size standard is $7.0 Million.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price service contract for this requirement.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. Nor does this request for information constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that any procurement action that may be issued for the Government's requirements related to other NOAA requirements, current or otherwise.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information to include:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;</p>
<p>2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;</p>
<p>3) A brief description of your firm's recent past experience (within past 3 years), such as recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information);<br /> <br />4) Identify from the list of major work components above those that your firm would likely subcontract out. Any subsequent contract will contain the mandatory FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which limits subcontracting costs to 50% of the price of the contract.</p>
<p>Information must be received by the Contract Specialist, Mr. Mark Caban, at mark.caban@noaa.gov by close-of-business on Tuesday, March 11, 2014.  Do not call regarding this sources sought notice.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only.  This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal.  This request does not obligate the government in any contract award.    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, is conducting preliminary research to determine the market capabilities of potential contractors to perform maintenance dredging in the Savannah, GA and Brunswick, GA Entrance Channels.   <br>  <br> The work will require dredging approximately 2 to 3 million cubic yards of maintenance material from the entrance channels of Savannah and Brunswick Harbors.  The dredged material shall be placed in the Offshore Dredge Material Disposal Sites (ODMDS).  The required dredging window will be 15 December through 31 March. <br>  <br> Hopper dredge(s) shall be required for the work.  The dredge(s) must have the capability to dredge maintenance materials which consist of sands and silts to a depth of -46 MLLW and to transport the dredged sediment up to 15 miles to ODMDS.  Quality Control System (QCS) will be required and the dredge(s) will be required to have Dredge Quantity Management (DQM) installed and operating throughout the contract.  Twenty four hour on board environmental monitoring shall be required. <br>  <br> Dredged material shall be placed in the offshore disposal area below the -25 MLLW level, and at least 100 meters inside the boundary of the ODMDS.  A depth of -30 feet is the warning threshold for monitoring and management purposes.  If -30 feet MLLW is reached, then management decisions will be made on future sediment placement to avoid exceeding the -25 foot MLLW threshold.  Furthermore, disposal shall be within a specific area within the ODMDS identified by USACE in consultation with EPA, Region 4 in order for disposal monitoring to be effective. <br>  <br> There are bin size restrictions in Savannah and Brunswick Harbor.  The Savannah bin restriction is 12,500 cu, yds.  The Brunswick bin size restrictions for the following navigation channel reaches are: <br> Stations +33+500 to 0+000 bin size restricted to 6,500 cu.yd. <br> Stations 0+000 to -19+000 bin size is unrestrictred. <br> Stations -19+000 to -23+000 bin size is restricted to 8,000 cu.yd. <br> Stations -23+000 to -34+000 bin size is restricted to 5,000 cu.yd. <br> Stations -34+000 to deep water bin size is restricted to 9,500 cu.yd. <br>  <br> A concurrence, or permit, for disposal of dredged material in the ODMDS does not authorize excessive leakage, overflow, or spill out of barges, dump scows, or hopper dredges of water and excavated material while en route to the ODMDS release zone.  Therefore, no overflow is allowed after the drag arms are raised and the dredge is on the way to the ODMDS. <br>  <br> An equipment list and capability of each piece of equipment to be used in the work is required.  The dredge shall be available for work upon issuance of the Notice to Proceed. <br>  <br> Environmental restrictions require all hopper dredging be performed between 15 December and 1 April.

<DESC>Notice of Intent
This is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Region intends to award a furnish and install contract to ABB, Inc. for the replacement of the Static Frequency Converter Controller at the Mount Elbert Pumped-Storage Plant (MTE) located near Granite, Colorado.  The ABB, Inc. (ABB) manufactured Static Frequency Converter (SFC) was installed by ABB in 1992.  The controller portion of the SFC is now near the end of its life and the current model is no longer supported by ABB.   ABB will replace the presently installed controller with a compatible programmable controller capable of operating the SFC used to start both 170,000HP pumps at MTE.  The contractor will be responsible for installing, programming, commissioning, documenting, training, and supporting the controller.
Reclamation is procuring this requirement pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Reclamation intends to award this contract during Fiscal Year 2014.   Reclamation believes that ABB is the only source that can successfully furnish and install the SFC Controller due to experience, manufacturing capabilities, and proprietary software information.  However, Reclamation will consider vendors that recognize they can fully provide the requirement can identify themselves in written notification to the Contract Specialist.  Written notification of capability statements or proposals must be received by the Contract Specialist by 4 p.m. local time on April 1, 2014.  Any information received from said vendors will be solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.
A Justification for Other Than Full and Open competition has been approved and will be made available on FedBizOpps and FedConnect within 14 days after contract award.
Questions can be directed to the Contract Specialist, Amanda Somerville, at 406-247-7797 or ASomerville@usbr.gov

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to make a Sole Source award under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Other Then Full and Open Competition, to Planmeca U.S.A Incorporated for the purchase of a comprehensive digital dental solution, as provided by the US Army Dental Command.  The device to be purchased will be the Planmeca PROMAX S3 Digital Panoramic X-ray system.  The Planmeca PROMAX S3 Digital Panoramic X-ray system is fully compatible with the needs of UT MEDCOM.  National Guard Bureau's Chief Dental Officer, COL April Snyder has directed all 54 territories to purchase this system.  The US Army Dental Command (DENCOM) has a Government off the shelf software used to manage all of the current radiography equipment, thus eliminating the requirement for proprietary vendor specific and costly software.  Planmeca intra oral and extra oral devices integrate best with DENCOM's software, thus reducing the requirement for additional and costly programming, development and data management.  Additionally, the DENCOM D-DINPACS PM, Mr Jeffrey Ribanic is concerned with standardization of hardware across the DENCOM - ease of use, medical maintenance, sustainment, warranties and end user interfaces.  DENCOM has purchased and deployed the Planmeca PROMAX digital panoramic machine to over 143 dental treatment clinics thus far from FY05 to present date - thus standardizing the entire user interface, standardizing the medical maintenance and providing diagnostic capabilities equal to any other vendor.  This will be the only notice of the Government's intent to solicit and negotiate with one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Certified firms having the ability to provide this product capability should notify Shan Grimmius in writing via e-mail at shan.r.grimmius.mil@mail.mil by 4:30 p.m. Mountain Standard Time on 13 March 2014.  All responses from qualified sources will be fully considered and responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No extensions will be granted.

<p>The Intelligent System Division (ISD) develops advances and deploys measurement science and standards to speed development, adoption, and integration of leading-edge intelligent technologies to advance U.S. manufacturing. To support ISD's efforts to develop a cyber-security risk management framework for smart manufacturing systems with associated standards, guidelines, performance metrics, and tools, it is necessary to model these systems and networks and determine the performance impacts of security technologies when used in smart manufacturing systems. This will lead to smart manufacturing systems that offer security, reliability, resiliency and continuity in the face of disruption and major incidents</p>
<p>The KUKA youBot robotic arms will be used in the industrial control systems cyber-security testbed. The arms will be dynamically programmed to cooperatively assemble a structure by software running on a separate PC platfom1. An industrial robotic system that allows for a focus more on the cyber-security aspects of the existing system and not on the programming of the robots is the division objective.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet. Please feel free to use the FBO site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.
<p><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to modify the Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Federal Cartridge Company (N00164-14-D-JN42) for 7.62mm, Special Ball Long Range ammunition (MK316 MOD 0). This modification is required due to an unforeseen quantity increase in requirements. The current contract ceiling will be increased by $3,225,000 for a new contract ceiling of $5,725,000.00, no other terms and conditions (e.g. unit of issue, FOB location, etc. will be modified).</p>
<p>The modification will be issued in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to Federal Cartridge Company, Anoka, MN as they are the only vendor manufacturing a cartridge that has passed all the required Weapon Systems Explosive Safety Review Board (WSERB) testing. Testing requirements include, but are not limited to, vibration, handling, storage, humidity, shipboard shock, danger zone, vertical replenishment, pressure, velocity, and accuracy. Award to any other vendor would result in duplication of costs to the Government for testing efforts and an additional 18 months to complete required testing. This delay would have detrimental impacts and is unacceptable to meet current delivery schedule requirements. Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet. Responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC, Crane. The Government anticipates awarding the modification to contract N00164-14-D-JN42 by 31 March 2014.</p>

<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps website for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.</p>

SPECIAL NOTICE - NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN BENEFACTOR MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL

INTRODUCTION

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires a renewal of an existing one (1) year (12-month) Benefactor membership with Health Level Seven International (HL7) or equal.

BACKGROUND

HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information.  These standards define how information is packaged and communicated from one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required for seamless integration between systems.  HL7 standards support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services, and are recognized as the most commonly used in the world.  There are seven (7) HL7 standards categories:  Primary Standards, Foundational Standards, Clinical and Administrative Domains, EHR Profiles, Implementation Guides, Rules and References, and Education & Awareness.

Membership to HL7 is crucial to the ongoing expansion and enhancement of the HL7 standard and the overall success of the organization.  The Benefactor level of membership offers additional benefits that help the organization emphasize their involvement with HL7.  This Benefactor membership includes all the benefits of organizational membership plus immediate access to all HL7 standards as they are released, the right to distribute HL7's standards on an internal basis solely for use within the organization, authorization to use excerpts from HL7 standards in the organization's implementation guides and the right to distribute them publically, the maximum number of assigned voting members, Annual Benefactor Award and recognition at HL7 working group meetings, and listing in the online Benefactor Directory. The Benefactor Directory places the logo on the front page of the HL7 website and includes a link to the organization's website generic log-in that gives the entire organization access to the Members Only section of the website, special recognition in HL7 press releases and other promotional materials, and special recognition in HL7 News (HL7's official newsletter).

VA has been an HL7 Benefactor member since 1996.  HL7 develops standards required for the VA to exchange healthcare information internally within the VA and externally with agencies such as the Department of Defense and Indian Health Services.

<p>(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ``compliance with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:<br />(1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:<br />(i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,<br />(ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;<br />(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, <br />blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;<br />(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, <br />suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;<br />(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;<br />(5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,<br />(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>a. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute or claim concerning this contract which is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting Officer, who shall state his decision in writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy of it to the Contractor. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor may appeal by mailing or otherwise furnishing to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, and the decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive; provided that if no such appeal is filed, the decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive.

LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>

<p>6. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned.

<p>7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.</p>
<p>b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.</p>
<p>c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>

<p>a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-</p>
<p>(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).</p>
<p>(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the <br />Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.</p>
<p>d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any</p>
<p>(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.</p>
<p>e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (Nov 2011) Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract.

<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof.

If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p>b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>

<p>a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>
<p>b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.</p>
<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items.

<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.</p>
<p>b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97 177):</p>
<p>(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. <br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. <br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

Research studies conducted at this Center utilize liquid nitrogen and the other gases for long-term storage of sensitive experimental and clinical cells and tissue samples.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.

<DESC><p>MERALCO Power Distribution Modernization Pilot Project</p>
<p>USTDA Activity No.: 2014-31005A</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Joseph Allan C. Baltazar<br />Senior Assistant Vice President and Head Network Technology Strategy and Execution<br />MERALCO<br />3/F Technical Services Building<br />Meralco Center, Ortigas Avenue<br />Pasig City 0300 Philippines<br />Tel: +63 2 6312222 Ext. 6482<br />Fax: +63 2 6328538<br />Email: jacbaltazar@meralco.com.ph<br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a power distribution modernization pilot project and associated implementation plan for MERALCO in Manila, Philippines.
<p>BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>MERALCO requested a USTDA-funded feasibility to determine key components needed to complete a pilot project and advance MERALCO system-wide Smart Grid implementation efforts. MERALCO has allocated $10.5 million for the pilot project, targeting installation of smart metering equipment for 10,000 existing customers, to help manage peak demand and set incentives for various consumption levels based on detailed data collected by the smart meters. The pilot would also address demand response to reduce high energy costs, minimize power loss, and define procedures for system-wide implementation of smart grid technologies. The detailed customer information would help reduce non-payment for services rendered, while providing flexibility in billing and electricity consumption, and assisting in electricity generation optimization by incorporating renewable resources in the technology mix.</p>
<p>MERALCO is the largest distribution utility in the Philippines, covering a 3,605 square mile footprint, serving 25 percent of the population, and experiencing over seven percent growth in electricity sales and over three percent growth in customer base.  MERALCO holds a 25-year congressional franchise license (June 28, 2003 - June 28, 2028) to construct, operate and maintain the electricity distribution system in 34 cities and 77 municipalities, generating 75 percent of Luzon's and 55 percent of the overall Philippines' electricity sales. MERALCO's distribution and sub-transmission network has a circuit length of approximately 1,060 miles, 115 substations, and 220 substation transformer banks. About 50 percent of Philippine Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 60 percent of manufacturing output is generated within MERALCO franchise area to serve residential, commercial, industrial and street-lighting customers.</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will help MERALCO develop the technical specifications and associated implementation plan for a power distribution modernization pilot project, with key components including Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Demand Response (DR) programs, smart grid-focused Distribution Management Systems (DMS), and system interoperability standards.  The pilot would address important system distribution issues related to demand response in order to reduce user demands, balance its grid, reduce high energy costs, develop and implement DR as a part of its DMS, settle contracts with participating customers, and upgrade and integrate control systems and communications infrastructure to DR operations.  The Study would include a review of MERALCO's medium and long-term modernization objectives, preparation of pilot scope, cost estimate, and procurement documents and bid specifications, as well as assessment of environmental and development impact.</p>
<p>MERALCO notes the following with regard to the Feasibility Study:</p>
<p>&bull;	In the document, Embedded Generation, Renewable Generation, Microgrids and Distributed Energy Resources loosely refer to the same thing.<br />&bull;	As Demand Response will be utilized as a mechanism to reduce ultra-high Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) prices, the U.S. Firm will note:<br />o	The Integrated Demand Response (DR) and Embedded Generation system will have the capability to participate in the Energy and Reserve markets of WESM.<br />o	If applicable, the business case will include benefits from (a) reducing ultra-high WESM prices, (b) deferment of power generation, transmission &amp; distribution facilities and c) Reduction of Ancillary &amp; Congestion Cost.<br />&bull;	Demand Response will consider embedded generation and will employ the following:<br />o	Interruption of load or control of thermostats of customers.<br />o	Use of on-site generation (PV, Wind Turbine, Diesel, etc.)<br />o	Use of on-site energy storage (Battery, Electric Vehicle, etc.)<br />&bull;	 The inverters will have the necessary features to mitigate the negative power quality impact of renewable generation and to provide support to the distribution grid.<br />&bull;	The Integrated Demand Response and Embedded Generation system may be a separate system but linked to the DMS. Part of the required technical specifications includes the necessary capabilities of the Fault Location Isolation &amp; Restoration (FLIR) and Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) of DMS to consider Demand Response and Embedded Generation.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $442,940 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br />https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp<br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00PM, Friday, March 25, 2014</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

The Government will evaluate the offers for acceptability and will not rank the offers by the non-price factors:

1.	Price Factor:

2.	Technical Factor: 
Acceptable:  Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Responses shall reference solicitation number DE-SOL-0006532, which is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes for this acquisition is 531210.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) at the Naval Petroleum Reserve 3 (NPR-3) (Government) intends to award a support services contract to include all labor, material, and equipment to provide brokerage services to the Department of Energy (DOE ) for the sale and transfer of the NPR-3 to private industry through best commercial practices in accordance with Title XXXIV of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, Pub. Law 105-261 (October 17, 1998), Section 3404.   Note: Travel costs will be reimbursed by DOE on a case-by-case basis and should not be submitted in the offeror?s cost proposal. Contractor shall provide a Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee proposal. 
1.0	INTRODUCTION NPR-3 was created by Presidential Order in 1915 and covers approximately 9,481 acres of land in Wyoming known as the Teapot Dome Oilfield.  The Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 Public Law 94-258 (April 5, 1976) directed that the reserves be developed at their maximum efficient rates.  NPR-3 is the only remaining Naval Petroleum Reserve administered by DOE.  It consists of a small stripper well oilfield that currently produces approximately 250 barrels of crude oil per day from approximately 400 producing wells. Efforts to bring on additional wells through primary production efforts (approximately 130 additional) that have been idle in the past for lack of maintenance are being brought back on production this year. DOE will be increasing production prior to the sale of the property. DOE also intends to continue its ongoing program to plug and abandon unproductive wells this year prior transfer of property.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

If you choose the second option, you will need to alter the CLIN structure for overage charges (we will quote the MB and minute overage charge) and you will need to allot funding against that CLIN for billing purposes. The majority of customers choose the barring option, but in the event you reach the limit during a time of need, the end-users will not have connectivity.  BARRING THE SIMS, OPTION 1

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute of Health, Clinical Center (CC) intends to award a Firm-Fixed price purchase order to Children's National Medical Center (Large Business) Washington, DC 20010-2916 on a sole source basis to procure laboratory testing services for Methotrexate, Sweat Chloride and a number of other miscellaneous testing for the purposes of patient care located at the Department of Laboratory Medicine.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center anticipates awarding a purchase order, which includes a base period of twelve (12) months and four (4) one year option periods. This order will be processed under the direction of simplified acquisition procedures to one (1) organization that meets the overall qualifications needed to provide the listed services. <br /><br />Children's National Medical Center is the only vendor known to analyze Sweat Chloride samples. Any attempt to switch to another vendor could possibly cause erroneous patient results and cause the Department of Laboratory Medicine to not be compliant with the guidelines established by the College of American Pathologists Accreditation Agency. Turn-around time of twenty-four (24) hours is crucial to this request and with the close proximity of Children's National, valuable time is saved in regards to chronically ill patients.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the acquisition of commercial items prescribed in FAR Part 12. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this posting. Any interested party must have the capability to provide twenty-four (24) hour turn-around time for results and have the capability to provide Sweat Chloride testing. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing this posting number, may be submitted to the CC, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of Ivan Jones, Contract Specialist, ivan.jones@nih.gov by the due date and time marked in this notice.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0001: Incorporates site visit sign-in sheet, Q&A, revised bid schedule and revised PWS. <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  This is a non-personnel services contract to provide inclinometer installation. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform drilling services for inclinometer installation as defined in this Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as government furnished property and services. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.  <br>    <br>  Background:   <br>  The left bank at Chief Joseph Dam has a massive landslide that has been creeping since monitoring began over 40 years ago. Fourteen (14) inclinometers were installed between 1973 and 1983, and each one within the confines of the slide has shown movement. The highest rate of movement is concentrated toward the toe at the southern end of the mass, nearest the dam, and 2 critical instruments have moved so much as to disable their ability to be read. The possibility for catastrophic movement affecting dam safety is not known, and a comprehensive study is underway to determine if measures need to be taken to avoid disaster, or if the landslide is a non-critical issue. These 2 critical inclinometers need to be replaced for this effort.  <br>    <br>  Objectives:  <br>  *Drill two 6 quote mark  diameter borings, one to 135 feet in depth and the other to 195 feet in depth, with an option for a third boring to 145 feet, for installation of 85mm diameter ABS plastic grooved inclinometer casing.  <br>  *Full recovery of mildly disturbed core or split-spoon soil samples for geological characterization by a field geologist.  <br>  *SPTs (standard penetration test) of soil units while drilling, and successful collection of 2 undisturbed Shelby tubes per boring.  <br>  *Borings to be drilled in varying overburden, with expected occasional cobbles, and into about 35 feet of hard bedrock.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Technical, qualifications and past performance, when combined, are equal to price. Award will be to the Offeror who presents the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest price (see Evaluation Factors for Award).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a Special Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.     <br>          <br>    For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation.     <br>          <br>    After contract award, a total of thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government RDT&E activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and SIL activities), with hardware deliveries to commence no later than sixty (60) days after contract award.     <br>          <br>    The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is providing a draft of the solicitation for the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) for review and comment by industry. ACC-APG intends to host face-to-face meetings with industry sources in approximately two weeks from the date of this posting, and the details of the meetings will be posted by amendment to this notice.    <br>        <br>    ACC-APG is particularly interested in receiving comments and questions from industry as early as possible to facilitate consideration of items prior to issuance of a formal solicitation.  Industry sources are directed to review the Draft RFP for additional important information.     <br>        <br>    The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is approximately forty-five (45) days after release of the draft RFP, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the formal RFP will be posted with response dates and    <br>    instructions as applicable to this solicitation.    <br>        <br>    The Government's intent is to solicit and award, via full and open competition, a single Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contracts with a One-    <br>    Year base period and three (3) One-Year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated services.    <br>        <br>    It is the Government's intent to award a contract in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process.    <br>        <br>    Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.    <br>        <br>    The above discussed intent is subject to change.    <br>        <br>    If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.    <br>        <br>    Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil or donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted.    <br>        <br>    All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified above. Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above. Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.    <br>        <br>    All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned.    <br>        <br>    No Classified information shall be submitted in response to this notice.    <br>        <br>    This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>See attached applicable clauses <BR> <BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits."

<DESC>This is not a solicitation. This Sources Sought Announcement is for the purpose of identifying small business concerns who are capable and interested in bidding on this dredging project.
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking sources for a construction project titled, Lower Snake and Clearwater Rivers Navigation Maintenance Dredging. This will be a fixed price construction contract. Place of performance is Franklin, Whitman, Asotin, and Garfield Counties in Washington State and Nez Perce County in Idaho. Construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100% of the contract price will be required. Responses to this announcement are due no later than&nbsp;4 March 2014 at 5:00pm, Pacific.</p>
<p>The work consists of mechanical dredging of the federal navigation channel, port berthing areas, and a navigation lock approach at four locations on the Snake River and lower Clearwater River. One site is the downstream navigation lock approach for Ice Harbor Dam Snake River Mile (RM) 9.5, while the other three sites are located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers in Lower Granite reservoir. The three sites in Lower Granite are the Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2) and the berthing areas for the Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5) and Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139). The dredging quantities are approximately 2,337 cubic yards at Ice Harbor Dam (Snake RM 9.5), 458,472 cubic yards at Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2), 14,143 cubic yards at Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139), and 4,664 cubic yards at Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5). The Corps identified a location in the Lower Granite reservoir (Snake RM 116) just upstream of Knoxway Canyon, as the in-water disposal site of the dredged materials. Disposal will include selective placement of material to construct a near-shore underwater bench and shape to create fish habitat. Disposal would form a uniform, gently sloping shallow-water bench along about 2,500 linear feet of shoreline. The top width of the dredging disposal section would be approximately 200 linear feet and generally would have a 2%-5% slope from the shoreline sloping out to the side slope catch point. The side slope of the dredging disposal section generally would be 1V on 10H (1 foot vertical on 10 feet linear). The water depth along the shoreline after placement of the dredged material would be 6-8 feet. The current water depths at the disposal site, RM 116, range from 20-30 feet. The work will also include before (pre), progress and after (post) hydrographic surveys, for the dredge and disposal areas for topographic control and quantity calculations, and water quality monitoring. Total volume of dredged material for all four locations is approximately 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards.</p>
<p>The onsite performance period is Dec 15, 2014 - Feb 14, 2015.</p>
<p>In the sources sought response, interested contractors MUST submit the following: 1) Describe your approach to successfully complete the dredging quantities within the onsite performance period considering the distance between the dredging locations described above and the disposal location RM116. 2) In the last dredging action in 2005-2006 turbidity limits were exceeded during the re-handling along the shoreline, momentarily stopping the placement several times and delaying completion of the dredged material placement. For the present acquisition, re-handling of the dredged material is required to place the material along the shoreline at RM 116 to achieve the desired contours. Generally describe your re-handling process at RM 116 and preventive actions to limit turbidity exceedances. 3) Describe the topographic and hydrographic surveying methods and procedures, positioning and depth finding means, you intend to use to monitor dredge performance, progress, and pay requests, and to provide quality control of completed dredged sections. 4) Describe your past experience using "real time" water quality monitoring, data acquisition systems that use satellite/cell phone telemetry, database development, and web-based data displays. 5) Submit your past performance history of work similar to the work described in the sources sought above. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://publications.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/EM_385-1-1_languages/EM_385-1-1_English_2008/toc.html</p>
<p>This sources-sought announcement is issued for the purpose of identifying small business concerns, including HUBZone small business firms, woman-owned small business firms, small disadvantaged business firms, veteran-owned small business firms, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms, with the capability to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>Information from firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement addressing the five technical areas identified above will be used in the Government's determination of whether to set aside this requirement for small business or open it to unrestricted competition. Include your firm's DUNS number, bonding capacity, and a statement indicating your small business type (small business, HUBZone, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, or service-disabled veteran-owned.) The NAICS Code for this project is 237990. The small business size standard for Dredging is no more than $25,500,000 in average annual receipts AND the firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern. Please email your response to: Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source cost type contract to Tufts University to provide a continuation of research and development services to the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), Project - RC-2119 entitled   Endangered Butterflies as a Model System for Managing Source-Sink Dynamics on Department of Defense Lands   <br>    <br>  Project RC-2119 was selected through a competed solicitation BAA-10-0001 for funding in FY11.   Contract W912HQ-11-C-0050, was awarded on 03 May 2011 to the Harvard College with a 60 month period of performance.  Tufts University is uniquely qualified as the Principal Investigator (PI) of this project has moved from the Harvard College to Tufts University.  Completing this work relies on Government expertise, contacts with DOD land managers and endangered species biologists. The PI has the expertise to successfully lead the project to completion without a substantial duplication of effort for the remaining two and a half years.  <br>    <br>  Objective of Scope of Work:  <br>    <br>  Department of Defense (DoD) lands provide the best available habitat for numerous threatened, endangered and at-risk species (TER-S), and many of these species are currently managed on military lands by controlled disturbances (e.g. fires) or by de novo restoration of habitat. However, these management strategies run the risk of converting sources (where births exceed deaths) into sinks (where deaths exceed births) or of creating ecological traps - low-quality but attractive restored habitat that bleeds animals from nearby sources, threatening  metapopulation viability. Importantly, our work will focus on temporal change in habitat quality following management or restoration that may lead local habitat patches to cycle from sink to source status and back.  <br>    <br>  Objective: Through a combination of field studies and state-of-the-art quantitative models, it is proposed to use three species of endangered butterflies as a model system to rigorously investigate the source-sink dynamics of species being managed on military lands. Butterflies have numerous advantages as models for source-sink dynamics, including rapid generation times and relatively limited dispersal, but they are subject to the same processes that determine source-sink dynamics of longer-lived, more vagile taxa.  <br>    <br>  This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br>    <br>  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting officer within forty five (45) days of publication of this announcement.

The Coast Guard intends to issue a firm fixed price delivery order utilizing the terms and conditions of an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), for the overhaul of:
<p>Schedule of Supplies/Services <br />Description</p>
<p>1. Spindle Assembly Qty 1 Each <br />P/N: 70102-28100-055<br />Required Delivery: 120 days ARO and induction at a rate of 4 per month<br /><br />2. Spindle Assembly Qty 1 each<br />P/N: 70102-28100-053<br />Required Delivery: 120 days ARO and induction at a rate of 4 per month</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>1. This SOW provides for the overhaul to like new condition of the Spindle Assembly, NSN 1615-01-HS1-4258, part number 70102-28100-055 for the US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center's (ALC), MH-60 aircraft. The Spindle Assembly identified in the Description of Items or Services will be furnished to the contractor at the prices on the 2014 Firm Fixed Price List for overhaul. The information contained in the scope of work is not intended to be all inclusive or to detract from procedures outlined in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications except where noted herein. All repair actions shall be in accordance with the OEM commercial repair manuals and Federal Aviation Regulation Parts 43 and 145 or alternate standard approved in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Medium Response Recovery (MRR) Engineering Branch. Components furnished hereunder shall be returned by the contractor in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation in USCG aircraft. Certification and documentation requirements apply.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling repair manuals, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul the Spindle Assembly for the Coast Guard fleet of MH-60 helicopters, as necessary to conform to the requirements of this SOW at the firm-fixed pricing established in the order schedule. The contractor shall provide the data and documentation requirements specified as part of this SOW.</p>
<p>3. The work shall be in accordance with the OEM specifications except where noted herein. The contractor must have access to all needed maintenance, repair manuals and performance/test/acceptance criteria and data to ensure that equipment is overhauled/modified, calibrated and operating in accordance with OEM specifications.</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall also perform a visual and technical inspection in accordance with the current applicable Component Maintenance Manual and correct all additional deficiencies found. This shall include replacement of broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion. Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair the efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas will be accomplished in accordance with the OEM specifications (or best commercial practices if not addressed by the OEM).</p>
<p>5. The Spindle Assembly is a flight critical safety item. Therefore, repair is restricted to only navy approved sources approved by the Service Design Control Activity (DCA). Public Law 108-136 Section 2319 of the Defense Appropriations Act of 2004 and NAVAIRINST 4200.25D state that the DCA shall approve sources for critical safety items and the procurement agency will only procure from sources approved by DCA. Serial numbers for these items are entered into the Coast Guard's Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) for tracking upon receipt at ALC. The ACMS is a computerized system used to record maintenance of aircraft components and assemblies. The contractor's responsibilities with ACMS consist of submission of required forms as outlined herein. All Spindle Assemblies are serial number tracked and shipped to the contractor's facility with a Significant Component History Record (SCHR) and a component repair report (CRR). The contractor shall review the component's attached Significant Component History Report (SCHR) prior to induction for the total number of hours installed since last overhauled. If the installed hours are less than 200, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing for additional instructions and SHALL NOT proceed without Contracting Officers approval.</p>
<p>The contractor shall verify the SCHR and CRR and ensure they correspond to the Spindle Assembly part number and serial number. All discrepancies shall be reported to the Contracting Officer prior to performance of work. The contractor shall complete the CRR. The original copy of CRR shall be mailed to Engineering Services Division, ACMS Tracking, Bldg 78, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001 and a copy shall be shipped with the repaired assembly. The contractor shall maintain a copy of each complete CRR for a period of ninety (90) days.</p>
<p>6. Upon receipt of the Spindle Assembly, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, MRR Supply Cell, in writing of the date of receipt, and shall confirm the serial number(s) of the item(s) received and the applicable order number. Notification by facsimile or email is acceptable: submit to (252) 335-6790, ATTN: Contracting Officer MRR Supply Cell. The email address will be provided by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. Corrosion is expected on equipment to be overhauled or modified under this order. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion on a Spindle Assembly or component thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with the OEM's current specifications and drawings.</p>
<p>8. Replacement Parts. Parts found to be defective shall be replaced as specified in the OEM's current procedures or as otherwise authorized in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center, MRR Engineering Division. In all cases, replacement parts shall be new. The Coast Guard requires Parts Integrity on all items awarded under this order. The Coast Guard utilizes serial number tracking systems for safety of flight items; and places a high priority on parts integrity within those components. As a result, any part that is determined to be in serviceable condition, every effort shall be made to reuse that part from the component from which it was removed. Contractor is advised that in order to expedite deliveries, parts may be transferred to/from other USCG components but serial number integrity documentation is required under this order. The contractor shall ensure that reused serviceable parts' serial numbers are documented as installed on the repaired component.</p>
<p>9. A DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable Tag-Material, or CG-1577-A (11-90), Unsatisfactory Report Tag, will be attached to each Not Ready for Issue (NRFI) component describing faults. The Spindle Assembly shall be overhauled or repaired to correct the specific fault(s) identified.</p>
<p>10. The Coast Guard requires delivery of repaired items no later than one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after induction of the material at the contractor's overhaul facility. The contractor guarantees completion at a monthly rate pre-determined on the 2014 Firm-Fixed Price Repair List valid XX/XX/XX through 09/30/14.</p>
<p>11. At the time of delivery for supplies under this order, the contractor shall prepare and furnish to the Coast Guard a properly completed DD Form 250 Material Inspection and Receiving Report or Commercial Bill of Lading.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2). <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was requested by the U.S. Enviromnental Protection Agency (EPA) to clean-up PCB contaminated sediments from New Bedford Harbor. The Harbor was contaminated from the 1940s through the 1970s by two electrical capacitor manufactming plants that discharged PCB waste. Water, sediment and biota have been contaminated endangering public health and the environment with PCB levels in sediment exceeding 100,000 parts per million (ppm).

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 
     	Office of Acquisition Operations
       	Technology Acquisition Center
           23 Christopher Way
           Eatontown, NJ 07724
      		

2.  Description of Action: The proposed action is for a firm-fixed price task order issued under  the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for the procurement of brand name NetApp 24X7X365 on-call, four hour response on-site support and annual software maintenance for the NetApp operating system.  This requirement also includes maintenance for existing NetApp high speed switches and will provide support and clustering functionality required by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Genomic Informatics System for Integrative Science (GenISIS).  GenISIS and the Million Veterans Program (MVP) is an initiative for transforming healthcare through the VA Office of Research and Development (ORD).  Personalized medicine and large scale genomic research have been established as strategic initiatives for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and VA ORD.  Personalized medicine describes the use of biological information to determine the right treatment, at the right time, for the right patient.  It represents an important advancement over today's current understanding of human health and VA has determined it critical to lead the discovery and implementation of personalized medicine to the benefit of VA healthcare systems.  The period of performance for this action is 12 months.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The required hardware and software maintenance of the existing NetApp switches enable uninterrupted use for managing research and development project data within the MVP at VHA's Boston Jamaica Plain Campus.  The MVP team currently uses NetApp storage products, switches and software as its storage infrastructure in support of GenISIS.  Currently there are 1.5 petabytes of raw storage installed.  The purpose of this order is to allow for the support and high availability of 1.5 petabytes of existing storage already implemented in support of GenISIS.  The 24X7X365 on-call, four hour response on-site support, annual software maintenance for the NetApp operating system, and NetApp certified high speed switches to support clustering mode will allow for higher throughput for genomic sequencing data for analysis by research personnel.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is 
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  The proposed action is for the procurement of maintenance and support of existing NetApp software and hardware that is being integrated with existing and installed NetApp switches.  The software maintenance services provide on-call and onsite support, bug fixes, patches, security updates, and upgrades to the NetApp proprietary operating system that manages the GenISIS storage infrastructure.  In January 2012, VA made a $687,000 investment in NetApp hardware and software through a competitive procurement.  The cost of new hardware and software would be approximately the same as the $687,000 paid in January 2012.  Further, acquisition of new hardware and software would require VA to incur additional implementation costs, to include the training of personnel to manage the new hardware and software, and the migration to the production environment after completing development testing with the new hardware and software solution.  None of the additional cost above would be recovered through competition.  Furthermore, no companies other than NetApp or their authorized resellers possess the proprietary information necessary to provide the required maintenance to the NetApp operating system and corresponding software.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2) the contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) Page. In addition, this Justification and Approval (J&A) will be made publicly available on the FedBizOps Page and posted on the NASA SEWP IV website with the solicitation.  

7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government's technical experts will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any suites of products available that will enable future requirements to be competed.  

8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted from June 2013 through December 2013 by searching product websites of NetApp, EMC and Isilon systems. Each vendor offers only a proprietary system that will only operate with their approved hardware and software.  This market research revealed that only NetApp, or authorized NetApp resellers would be capable of providing the support and annual software maintenance necessary for the existing NetApp solution.  Only NetApp certified software is compatible and can integrated into a proprietary NetApp system. 

9.  Other Facts:  None.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  
Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, Ann Arbor Medical Center, 506-14-2-1384-0182.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
The requirement is to provide programming modifications for VA funded research study (IIR 12-412-2), "Technologically Enhanced Coaching (TEC): A Program to Improve Diabetes Outcomes, that assesses the impact of an interactive voice response (IVR) based peer coach program to manage diabetes symptoms and medication usage." These modifications are to an existing IVR program developed by C/J media.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
$10,550.00, C/J Media, Inc, 261 E 12th Ave Ste 100, Eugene, OR 97401.   The contractor will work with the VA on the programming modifications of an IVR system. The time period is March 24 - June 30, 2014.
During the design and development phase, the contractor shall work closely with the VA project team to modify the existing peer-to-peer IVR infrastructure to accommodate new research content and requirements.  Once the design and development is finalized, the contractor shall help move the finished system to a local server facility at the University of Michigan Academic Computing Center (MACC) for implementation, and provide instructions to project staff on the functionality of all modifications. 
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
	Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;?
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):

This contract request is for the modification of an existing system that was designed and built by C/J media. Since they are intimately familiar with the underlying structure of the application and all of the components, the modifications would be faster and less expensive for this small business to do, compared to another contractor who is unfamiliar with the application. A new contractor would need to allocate significant start-up time to review the project infrastructure prior to beginning development work.  This start-up time would include, but is not limited to:  1) analyzing the program proposal and program written materials for  TAMMs project; 2) reviewing the programming language and infrastructure for the existing  peer-to-peer IVR infrastructure to accommodate "single coach" to "many patient" interactions, script and logic modification, and database creation to accommodate one-to-many interactions; and 3) assessing the website infrastructure for an existing module of the CarePartner program, including functions of: interactive website reports; participant and stakeholder enrollment web-forms; call scheduling functions. 
The vendor must be able and willing to develop an IVR system that will be compatible with system requirements and hosting infrastructure at the Michigan Academic Computing Center (MACC). Currently, all existing program modules are hosted at the MACC, and this new system developed by the vendor must be software and hardware compatible with our existing systems. Vendor will work with staff at the MACC in addition to other key IT staff at the University of Michigan (UM) in order to learn about the complex hosting environment at the MACC, including SIP provisions, back-up solutions, and other relevant project development and production environment topics. Vendor will continue to work with the MACC and other UM IT staff to support said project throughout the duration of the project development and production.
In addition, the application is written in Asterisk software, which is not commonly used in the marketplace.  A new contractor would need to provide time and resources to train staff either by sending them to Asterisk boot camp or through other educational opportunities.
The proposed work is for building on previous work to modify an existing application that C/J media designed and developed. Any vendor other than C/J media would need to allocate significant start-up time to review the application prior to beginning development work. The research study is under tight deadline to complete all requirements by Summer of FY14 in order to stay on target with VA research funding requirements.
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
FSS and the internet were searched. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
$10,550.  This price is fair and reasonable based on historical pricing for these services.  PO 506-C20212 was awarded for $18,000 on 9/10/2012 for similar IVR modifications for another research study, "Improving the quality of care for patients in transition."
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
FSS and the internet were searched.  No other vendor could complete the work within the existing time frame.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
None
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
See paragraph 6 above.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
Should a requisition of this nature recur, the market will be surveyed to locate possible new vendors.
12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11,  Indianapolis VA Medical Center, Transaction #583-14-1-997-0026.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Procurement of four Synapse Cardiovascular Client Software Concurrent User Licenses.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  $49,840.  Fuji Medical Systems, 333 Ludlow St, Stamford, CT 06912.  Cardiology service requires concurrent licenses in order to read, assess and review images within the Cardiology PACS system (ProSolve).  Licenses are needed for reviewers to read these images and be able to perform care at the VA.  The VA has just completed a license audit that determined the amount of concurrent licenses that were needed to ensure that the appropriate amount were being purchased while being cost effective.  The average was 3.5 concurrent licenses needed, thus four will be purchased to meet need.  These licenses are proprietary and no other licenses can offer the functionality necessary.  The agency is requesting four (4) Synapse Cardiovascular Client Software Concurrent User licenses.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

<DESC>The Forest Service intends to award a HUBZone sole source contract to Roadtech Inc. under Negotiated Procedures for the purchase of mobile rock crusher hammers. This requirement is proposed to be a sole source procurement to a certified HUBZone company under the authority of the HUBZone Act of 1997 (15 U.S.C. 631 note) and FAR 19.1302. Justification for such procedures: This type of machine is less expensive to operate, recycles previously unsuitable material on site thereby eliminating disposal problems, can operate on small single lane roads, minimizes material handling and hauling costs, has low environmental impacts, and has the capability of blending soil stabilizers or dust abatement products into the road material. This method not only completely eliminates the costly removal and replacement of the material to be crushed, but can re-establish a native roadbed without spreading seeds and/or diseases from Forest to Forest. This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals. If there are businesses that can provide the aforementioned product, and meet the minimum requirements listed below, they must respond by submitting in writing an expression of interest in competing on the procurement and provide supporting documentation as to how their proposed product meets the stated minimum requirements by March 7, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. MST. The mobile rock crusher must meet the following minimum requirements: The mobile rock crusher shall be capable of taking oversized rock that has been windrowed along the roadway and crush it as the machine progresses down the road. Operating sites may vary from steep, narrow mountain roads to developed pit sites. The machine shall be capable of blending all types of material, regardless of shape or hardness. Machine shall be capable of crushing rocks up to 16" to an aggregate graduation of &frac34;" minus. Mobile rock crusher shall be built to a size that does NOT require any oversize or overweight permits when being transported on State, County, or Federal Highway; crusher shall have adjustment capability of hammers and anvils to adjust for wear to increase the consistency of the aggregate produced; equipment shall be designed with a multi-position lift frame which allows the crusher head to be rotated so crews may work with the underside of the machine facing them at working level to increase safety; the crusher shall have shock protection to reduce vibration; have a removable anvil weldment for ease of service and repair, and the crusher shall have radial attachment of the tooling, which results in much easier and faster replacement of wear parts. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
