<DESC>The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, is soliciting proposals to maintain and further develop the NIDCD National Temporal Bone, Hearing and Balance Pathology Resource Registry that serves as a national resource for both the public and the biomedical research communities to promote research in the pathology underlying diseases and disorders of hearing and balance.  The Registry provides information and outreach services to the public and to health care practitioners on the acquisition of temporal bone and related brain tissues for research purposes.  It also serves the biomedical research community by establishing and maintaining a catalog of currently active and inactive human temporal bone and brain tissue collections and by conserving temporal bone and brain collections by brokering the transfer of tissue specimens from inactive collections to active research centers.  The Registry enables investigators to identify and locate all available processed temporal bones and related brain tissue specimens held in the United States by clinical and histopathologic diagnoses and other pertinent data so that further studies may be pursued.  Additional contract activities will continue to encourage the pursuit of research on the diseases and disorders of hearing and balance, particularly research utilizing the techniques of molecular biology and genetics and cellular biology by:  1) disseminating pertinent information to the auditory and vestibular research communities, 2) developing and fostering a program of professional education on pathology of the auditory and vestibular systems, and 3) encouraging investigator collaborations in the study of the human temporal bone and the related brain structures of hearing and balance.  A five-year, cost-reimbursement type contract is anticipated, with award made on or about March 1, 2004.  The solicitation will be issued on or about January 23, 2003, and will be posted on this Web site and at http://ocm.od.nih.gov/drc/rfp.htm.  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking these Web sites for any amendments to the solicitation.  Proposals will be due sixty days after the date of issuance of the solicitation.    All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NA 1. The Army announces its intention to create a research center of excellence providing innovative concepts to focus the talent of industry and academia on the critical biotechnology technology needs of the Army and to develop biotechnology solution to Arm y problems.  The purpose of this research center of excellence is to conduct unclassified scientific research into biotechnology-based solutions for engineered systems, and for the soldier, in particular areas of emphasis. A single university will host thi s center, which will emphasize revolutionary cross-disciplinary biotechnology research addressing sensors, electronics and photonics, soldier health and performance, and the technical fundamentals associated with, and enabling development of, advanced capa bilities in these application areas. Army Biotechnology Research Center.   The objective of the Army Biotechnology Research Center is to enable biotechnology-fueled revolutionary enhancement of performance of engineered systems and soldier survivability th rough the development of novel principles, materials, processes and systems for integration into the Objective Force.   To be effective, the research concepts, and technical approaches toward solutions for development, will have to be compatible with a var iety of complicating factors, including mission requirements, limited energy resources, communications needs, and rugged insensitivity or adaptive responsivity to extremes of temperature, humidity, storage, damage, mechanical shock, impact and soilage. 2. The university host will be selected through a limited competition with the intention of creating a unique national asset for conducting revolutionary biotechnology research. In a limited competition, only a limited number of sources are able to compete  due to competitive barriers that are inherent in the government's requirement. In the case of this UARC for Biotechnology, a competition limited to universities will be conducted for the award of a contract under which a distinct Center will be establishe d to conduct research in biotechnology for the Army. The Army will invest at least $5M annually for this UARC to concentrate on innovative biotechnology research addressing the emphasis areas outlined very briefly above. The university host will provide “p rimary user” facilities for this UARC and, along with its industrial partners, will commit significant infrastructure, resources, and personnel to complement the government’s investment. The university will create cooperative partnerships with industry tha t will ensure the technical innovations emerging from the research will transition rapidly into militarily relevant applications and result in producible technologies. Partnerships with industry are a key factor in the success of the Center.   The Army wil l also require the UARC to create cooperative partnerships with industry so that these technical innovations made by the university will result in the production by industry of integrated prototypes that may be assessed and eventually manufactured in large  scale.  Because of the large potential for commercial spin-offs, the Army anticipates significant industrial cost sharing with the UARC and will likely provide direct support of the industrial activities to support this integration effort. The award is an ticipated in September 2003.  Other terms of the competition will be stipulated in a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to be issued in mid-January. 3. In anticipation of the BAA, the Army will host two pre-competition informational meetings before the end of January 2003, one on the west coast and one on the east coast. The dates and locations of these meeting will be available in mid-January on the A rmy Research Office (ARO) website provided below.  Universities are allowed to send no more than 5 representatives, each of whom must pre-register to attend.  Pre-registration information and directions will be available at the ARO web site: http://www.aro .army.mil/b iotech/biotechdraftbaa.pdf.  Questions regarding the center may be posed by contacting the website at: http://www.aro.army.mil/biotech/index.htm. 4. Both questions and answers will be posted at the ARO web site.  This web site will keep you informed of events during the planning stages of the Biotechnology Center program.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to award a new purchase order, the period of  performance of which will be six (6) months from date of award, for a Software Support Study based on the TACOM-ARDEC Life Cycle Support Engineering Center’s (LCSEC) General Test Set to support the Office of Project Manager for Close Combat Systems munition programs to Materials, Communication and Computers Incorporated, LLC, (MATCOM) Potomac, MD on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) only one responsible source.  Rational being that as MATCOM developed the TACOM-ARDEC LCSEC, it would not be economical nor  timely to compete this requirement given the costs necessary for another  contractor to become familiar enough with the TACOM-ARDEC LCSEC to conduct the Software Support Study.

<DESC>The Eastern Administrative Support Center (EASC) intends to acquire supplemental fishery observer services for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), Woods Hole, MA.  Contractor services will collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data for fisheries by placing observers aboard U.S. domestic fishing vessels in the Northwest Atlantic.  This data, which cannot be obtained either dockside or while aboard government research vessels, is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ.  Observers are also deployed to foreign fishing vessels participating in joint venture operations with American vessels.  This work requires deploying certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  The contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings.  Vessels operate out of ports from North Carolina to Maine.  Typically, trips are 1-14 days in duration.  The vessels operate in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions.  Observers shall collect scientific, management, compliance and other data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples.  For most domestic fisheries, observer coverage is mandated by several Fishery Management Plans (FMP), Take Reduction Plans (TRP), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Management and Conservation Act (MSFMCA) and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA).  Data collected once per trip includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation.  The contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart.  This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price type of contract with a period of performance of one (1) year with three one-year options, to start on or about April 1, 2003.  The anticipated issue date for the solicitation is January 21, 2003 with a closing date on or about February 21, 2003.  All responsible offerors may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. Requests for the solicitation must be in writing or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Fax number (757) 441-3786.

Canberra  Industries is the only firm that can supply this need in order to maintain software and hardware compatibility with EPA's Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)-based Canberra system that is presently used. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541519.  This notice is not a request for proposal nor a  solicitation for offers. However, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirements stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to the Department of Urology at the University of Minnesota to gather data on an immunoassay of human sperm to relate human sperm SP22 levels with the fertility of the sample.  EPA patent US 6,197,940 B1 claims the utility of SP22 antibodies for use in a diagnostic immunoassay to evaluate fertility of human semen samples and is currently partners with an organizations interested in the application of the human SP22 diagnostic application.   Specifically, EPA requires the University of Minnesota to use affinity-purified, sheep anti-rat recombinant SP22 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) to quantify SP22 levels on human sperm.  Data will be derived on 100 samples representing men (50-100) with known fertility status (i.e.  fertile vs known or suspected idiopathic infertile), as well as several (approximately 5) men over time following vasectomy.   For each sample, SP22 will be quantified in a detergent extract of sperm, as well as in semen (i.e. whole sperm).  For post-vasectomy samples neat semen will be assayed.   Ultimately, the University of Minnesota will deliver the following: 1.  ELISA data for SP22 in detergent extracts of human sperm and a             mathematical analysis of the relationship between SP22 in these samples and the fertility of the patient.  2.  ELISA data for SP22 in human semen and a  mathematical analysis of  the relationship between SP22 in these samples and the fertility of the patient. 3 ELISA data for SP22 (or disappearance thereof) in human semen over following vasectomy.  The EPA has identified the University of Minnesota as the only organization with the qualifications  and products to perform the task within the prescribed time frame, i.e., FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements".  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit qualification statements no later than 15 days  after the date of this publication. Please reference RFQ #X7C009 in any correspondence.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Tsvetelina Petrova, Ph.D. for the services of performing calculations, writing software to control instrumentation, locking lasers to frequency standards, and evaluating system performance. The work is in the field of ultra-high accuracy interferometry. The contractor must have experience in Linux and C and will be expected to work on a project involving five independent DSP (digital signal processing) dedicated processors. The contractor must furthermore have experience with vacuum equipment, essential to our Fabry-Perot displacement interferometer.  Finally, we seek a contractor with strong computational skills and experimental abilities in optics and spectroscopy.  These qualities are critical to the success of our  project involving an optimized frequency comb at visible wavelengths and its application for atomic spectroscopy. 

 The combination of skills (computation, optics, spectroscopy, and vacuum) we require is very comprehensive.  Ms. Petrova is a scientist with a PhD who majored in optics and spectroscopy.  She has the skills that ideally match our requirements, both computational and experimental.  On the experimental side, she has experience in optimization of optical sources and spectroscopy.  On the computational side, she is experienced with Windows, Linux, C++, and MATLAB, which are essential to our laser stabilization apparatus, interferometric servo loop, and data analysis. In our judgment, we would not be able to find another candidate with the skills needed to fulfill our tasks without investing heavily in his/her training.
The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about January 17, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by January 17, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DARPA INITIATIVE IN PROGNOSIS, SOL BAA03-02, Addendum 1, 
DUE 03/17/03, POC: DR. LEO CHRISTODOULOU, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4553, Email: baa03-02@darpa.mil URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.  PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving proposals for research, development and demonstration of a prognosis system for real time or near-real time asset capability prediction, with specific emphasis on materials and structures.  The vision of the prognosis system is to provide military commanders the data and quantitative performance predictions to adaptively manage, deploy, and use individual combat systems to the limit of their current capability.  The objective of the program is to create a tool for predicting near-term system capability including imminent failure, without the need for any inspection or maintenance action.  Critical elements of such a prognosis system include; a.)  early sensing, warning, interpretation and prediction of significant deviations from normal operational parameters including warning of imminent failure independent of normal inspection, maintenance schedules and procedures, b.)  techniques for establishing state awareness in large, complex machinery and structures, detecting, tracking and predicting evolution of damage using all available techniques with particular emphasis on signature deconvolution, feature extraction, innovative sensor technology and sophisticated reasoning methodologies for future capability prediction, c.)  universal methodologies into which system/platform and material-specific modules can be incorporated as required, and d.)  common and open data structures that enable new and emerging models, materials and sensors from a variety of sources to be incorporated into the prognosis system as their maturity allows.  PROGRAM CONTENT:  This program aims to develop the constituent technologies that enable the critical elements above and to demonstrate these elements in an integrated prognosis system designed for a specific challenge problem (e.g., wing structure, turbine disk).  Technical issues to be addressed include; 1.)  physics of failure models in materials under complex and varying conditions, 2) damage accumulation and evolution in materials and structures induced by multiple and interacting damage and failure mechanisms, 3) stochastic and probabilistic effects in materials, 4.)  innovative sensor technologies needed to detect incipient and advancing damage, 5.)  means for evaluating uncertainties and error estimation for both models predictions and sensor data, 6.)  techniques for establishing state awareness in large, complex machinery and structures and for detecting, tracking and predicting evolution of damage using all available techniques (autonomic system interrogation, local and global sensors, signature deconvolution, feature extraction, etc.), 7.)  reasoning methodologies for future capability prediction and 8) a robust prognosis system architecture that includes safeguards to limit false positive and false negative predictions and presents the appropriate data/predictions to relevant military commanders (weapon system operators, local/unit commanders at various levels, fleet commanders, maintenance engineers, etc.).  Proposers may address additional prognosis technologies deemed critical to the prognosis program not listed here.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, simulations, and other research activities planned in each of the seven technical issues listed above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18 month technical objectives (?go/no-go? milestones) for each of the technical issues that clearly demonstrate the program is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, and 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths.  Specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of technology elements are required periodically, and a final ?blind? demonstration of the entire prognosis system is required at the end of the program.  Proposals should include identification and assessment of critical technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged.  Proposed efforts should not exceed forty-eight months.  If proposals include use of Government facilities, offerers will be expected to conclude commercial services arrangements with the providing government facility.  Offerer teaming with DoD government activities for R&D efforts other than facility use is discouraged.  It is anticipated that the results of any DARPA-funded directly-related R&D efforts conducted by Government organizations will be provided to all offerers who receive awards under this BAA.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 03-02 dated December 16, 2002.  To receive consideration under this addendum proposals are due no later than 1600 ET March 17, 2003, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA, but not this addendum.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Evaluation of the proposals will be based on the following criteria, in decreasing order of importance: 1) the scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort as they address the program requirements listed above, 2) the likelihood that the proposed development will provide unique and/or new capabilities for the DoD, 3) the qualifications of the key personnel, and adequacy of the equipment and facilities to meet the objectives, and 4) cost realism.  Proposers may be asked to present their proposal in person to an evaluation committee.  A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  Evaluation and selection of proposals for award will be made to those offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Technology Investment Agreement (TIA)," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227) Because of the specific nature of this solicitation, no portion of this program will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation.  However, these organizations are encouraged to team with other proposers.  GENERAL INFORMATION: In all correspondence, reference BAA03-02, Addendum 1.  Proposals will not be returned.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.  All support contractors are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as "GOVERNMENT ONLY."  For general administrative questions and proposal formatting, please refer to the original FEDBIZOPPS announcement for BAA03-02 dated December 16, 2002.  ADDRESS FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS: DARPA/DSO, Attn: BAA03-02, Addendum 1, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.

<DESC>NA **SECOND NOTICE - This synopis is being issued to extend the response date from: 17 January 2003 to:  24 January 2003.** The United States Army is placing greater emphasis on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) capabilities through the increased use of manned and unmanned sensors and sensor syste ms and payloads.  PM RUS is responsible for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unattended ground sensors (UGS) and payloads for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  PM RUS is collecting information on the numerous sensor and sensor system and payload types and  their capabilities available in the commercial sector (producible) and under development.  Understand that there are significant weight and volume limitations for UAV based sensors, therefore anything larger than 150 pounds or 68.4 kilograms or 3 cubic fe et or .057 cubic meters will be to large for our needs.  Also, UGS are normally man portable at or below 45 pounds or 20.52 kilograms.  Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) will use this information initially to develop a sensors and payl oads catalog based on their type and level of maturity.  As the Army's Operational Requirements Documents (ORD) mature, this catalog of information will be utilized to assess the sensor, sensor system, and payload types that are available to meet the Army' s requirements as well as identify efforts under development that may satisfy Government requirements in the future.  The Government is requesting two pages of information.  The first page of information provided by a potential offeror will be listed on th e PM RUS public access web site and in a published Sensors and Payloads Catalog.  The second page of potential offeror provided information will be for the US Government's internal usage only.  The catalog will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensur e it remains current.  This will be achieved by periodic requests for information, which will be posted via the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  If and when it is practical, PM RUS will purse the establishment of ordering and/or omnibus type contracts  with offerors to meet the Army's needs.  PM RUS will also share the general sensor, sensor system and payload information collected and any developed contracting capacities with other Army, Service and Agency offices that have similar requirements.  Senso r, sensor system, payload and program information is requested on the following sensor, sensor system and payload types and capabilities - Acoustic; Agile Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Airborne Minefield Detection (AMD); Biological Weapons Detection (B WD); Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN); Chemical Weapons Detection (CWD); Communications / Data Relay (CDR); Communications & Noncommunications Electronic Attack (CNEA); Communications Electronic Attack (CEA); Electro-Optic (EO); Electr o-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Airborne Mine Detection (LAMD); Electronic Intelligence (EI); Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR); Foliage Penetration (F OPEN); Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR); Hyper-Spectral (HS); Imager - Daylight; Imager Infrared (Imager IR); ISR Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT); Laser Radar (LADAR); Laser Range Finder (LRF); Laser Range Finder / Target Designator (LRF/TD) ; Laser Range, Laser Indicator, Laser Designator (LD/LI/LD); Laser Spot Tracker (LST); Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR); Magnetic; Meteorological; Multi-Spectral (MS); Nuclear Radiation Detection (NRD); Passive Infrared (Passive IR); Radio Frequency (RF ); Seismic; Sense Through Foliage (STF); Sense Through The Wall (STTW); Signal Intelligence (SIGINT); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Moving Target Indicator (MTI); Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS); Ultra-Spectral (US); Uncool ed Infrared (Uncooled IR); and Urban /MOUT Advanced Sensor System (UMASS).

<DESC>NA **SECOND NOTICE - This synopis is being issued to extend the response date from: 17 January 2003 to:  24 January 2003.** The United States Army is placing greater emphasis on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) capabilities through the increased use of manned and unmanned sensors and sensor syste ms and payloads.  PM RUS is responsible for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unattended ground sensors (UGS) and payloads for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  PM RUS is collecting information on the numerous sensor and sensor system and payload types and  their capabilities available in the commercial sector (producible) and under development.  Understand that there are significant weight and volume limitations for UAV based sensors, therefore anything larger than 150 pounds or 68.4 kilograms or 3 cubic fe et or .057 cubic meters will be to large for our needs.  Also, UGS are normally man portable at or below 45 pounds or 20.52 kilograms.  Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) will use this information initially to develop a sensors and payl oads catalog based on their type and level of maturity.  As the Army's Operational Requirements Documents (ORD) mature, this catalog of information will be utilized to assess the sensor, sensor system, and payload types that are available to meet the Army' s requirements as well as identify efforts under development that may satisfy Government requirements in the future.  The Government is requesting two pages of information.  The first page of information provided by a potential offeror will be listed on th e PM RUS public access web site and in a published Sensors and Payloads Catalog.  The second page of potential offeror provided information will be for the US Government's internal usage only.  The catalog will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensur e it remains current.  This will be achieved by periodic requests for information, which will be posted via the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  If and when it is practical, PM RUS will purse the establishment of ordering and/or omnibus type contracts  with offerors to meet the Army's needs.  PM RUS will also share the general sensor, sensor system and payload information collected and any developed contracting capacities with other Army, Service and Agency offices that have similar requirements.  Senso r, sensor system, payload and program information is requested on the following sensor, sensor system and payload types and capabilities - Acoustic; Agile Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Airborne Minefield Detection (AMD); Biological Weapons Detection (B WD); Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN); Chemical Weapons Detection (CWD); Communications / Data Relay (CDR); Communications & Noncommunications Electronic Attack (CNEA); Communications Electronic Attack (CEA); Electro-Optic (EO); Electr o-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Airborne Mine Detection (LAMD); Electronic Intelligence (EI); Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR); Foliage Penetration (F OPEN); Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR); Hyper-Spectral (HS); Imager - Daylight; Imager Infrared (Imager IR); ISR Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT); Laser Radar (LADAR); Laser Range Finder (LRF); Laser Range Finder / Target Designator (LRF/TD) ; Laser Range, Laser Indicator, Laser Designator (LD/LI/LD); Laser Spot Tracker (LST); Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR); Magnetic; Meteorological; Multi-Spectral (MS); Nuclear Radiation Detection (NRD); Passive Infrared (Passive IR); Radio Frequency (RF ); Seismic; Sense Through Foliage (STF); Sense Through The Wall (STTW); Signal Intelligence (SIGINT); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Moving Target Indicator (MTI); Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS); Ultra-Spectral (US); Uncool ed Infrared (Uncooled IR); and Urban /MOUT Advanced Sensor System (UMASS).

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO ANSWER TWO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED AND TO INCLUDE A CLARIFICATION STATEMENT REGARDING THE TAP CHANGER AND NO LOAD TAP CHANGER.

Question 1.  The modification talks about a site supervisor to be on site during installation while testing is completed.  What testing is to be done when the unit is installed?  Is the contractor responsible for this testing?  Answer.  If the unit is returned in component pieces and assembled on site, then the contractor's site supervisor must be present to oversee the reassembly and operational testing.  If the unit is returned in a completely assembled condition, then a site supervisor is not required.  In this case, operational testing of the completed unit will have been performed at the contractor's plant.  Items C through F of the original combined synopsis/solicitation dated 17 December 2002 discuss testing of the unit for proper operation and function.
 
Question 2.  Is there a certain time of day on Jan. 06th that the quotation is due? The original Combined Synopsis/Solicitation said it must be submitted no later than 1630 CST on 06 January 2003.

3.  CLARIFICATION:  Item G on the original Combined Synopsis/Solicitation dated 17 December 2002 and item 1.7 of Modification 03 posted 02 January 03 both state:  QUOTE If tap changer or other components are found defective, customer will be advised as to replacement cost. UNQUOTE.  In Modification 03, in the first sentence of the Description of Work, we also reference the no load tap changer.  To avoid any confusion, the no load tap changer is damaged and does require repair or replacement.

<DESC>Spectral Sensing of Bio-Aerosols Program: SOL BAA03-07, proposals due April 11, 2003, POC: Dr. Steven Buchsbaum, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  Facsimile: (703) 516-7360, E-mail:  baa03-07@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred).  Contractual point of contact: DARPA Contracts Management Office (CMO), Attn: Mr. Mark Bennington, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  Facsimile:  (703) 696-2208; E-mail: mbennington@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred).

OBJECTIVE:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) is soliciting proposals (technical and cost) from qualified corporations, research centers, universities, FFRDCs and DOE laboratories for the Spectral Sensing of Bio-Aerosols Program (SSBA) program under BAA 03-07.  A critical component of an effective biological warfare (BW) defense is realtime, pre-exposure detection, discrimination, and identification of the full spectrum of threats: spore, bacteria, virus and toxin.  The Spectral Sensing of Bio-Aerosols program will develop sensors to address the urgent need for biological weapons agent (BWA) trigger sensors and detect-to-warn sensors with fast response times and significantly improved false alarm rates (Pfa).  The goal of this program is to develop point detection sensors with response times of less than one minute and with at least a one order of magnitude reduction in false alarm rate relative to current sensors.  A specific set of performance goals will be provided in a separate document.  The program will also evaluate whether any of the proposed sensors can provide detection and localization of a biological agent at useful standoff ranges.  Offerors are free to team with any entity, including Federal and Department of Defense Laboratories.  If an offeror intends to team with a federal entity, it should include a copy of the teaming arrangement or a signed commitment letter along with a description of the tasks the federal entity will perform and the costs associated with those tasks.  

ACQUISITION INFORMATION:  DARPA requires that all parties interested in participating in this BAA register their organization by providing a principal point of contact, phone number, fax and email to baa03-07@darpa.mil with the SUBJECT LINE: BIO-AEROSOLS POC INFORMATION.  

DARPA will host a Pre-proposal Conference on 5 March 2003 at the Kosiokoff Center at Johns Hopkins University-Applied Physics Laboratory as described at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/spobioaerosols/. Each organization that plans to attend this meeting must indicate their intention by email to BAA03-07@darpa.mil, with the subject line, "BIDDERS CONFERENCE".  In addition, each organization must provide the names of all planned attendees (using the same email address).  Additional instructions will be provided to those who register.  Registration to attend this meeting must be received no later than 24 February 2003.

Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute DARPA's solicitation for this BAA.  Evaluations of all proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal considering the following general criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:  (1) the offeror's ability to meet or exceed the DARPA SSBA program goals and objectives defined in the PIP; (2) overall scientific merit and technical approach; (3) offeror's capabilities, past performance and related experience; and (4) proposed cost and cost realism.  Specific criteria for each proposal category can be found in the PIP.  Multiple awards are anticipated for the SSBA program. As a result of this BAA, DARPA may award traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and/or Other Transaction Agreements.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:
Proposers must obtain the BAA 03-07 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including the technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and formats of abstracts and proposals.  Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award.  The PIP is not classified and may be obtained via the World Wide Web (WWW) at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#spo.  

Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be sent via email to baa03-07@darpa.mil.  A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) compilation will be posted on-line and periodically updated.  The FAQ will also be found at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#spo.  It is anticipated that contracts will be awarded beginning in May 2003.  A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP.  

The Government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published at http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#spo.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the following requirements:  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.  

It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-Government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  Support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose.  Contractor personnel are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each offeror agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.  DARPA is seeking participation from the widest number of offerors.
