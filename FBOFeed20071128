The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to 1818 Australian Avenue, LLC.   The extension will be for 14,380 rentable square feet of fully serviced space and twenty-five secured surface parking spaces for a term of three months.

The government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a succeeding lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government?s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Office of Contracts (CON), Office of Engineering and Technical Services, Engineering Technical Directorate, Satellite Systems Division, intends to non-competitively negotiate a firm-fixed price (FFP) follow-on contract award with Optimal Satcom, Inc., 1851 Alexander Bell Drive, Suite 405, Reston, Virginia. This follow-on contract will cover license, maintenance, and upgrade of the existing COMPLAN and STAR software. The basis for using "Other Than Full and Open Competition" for this procurement is 41 USC 253 (c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency requirements). Optimal Satcom, Inc. is the only company known that can provide the COMPLAN and STAR software license and maintenance due to the existence of limited rights or patent rights. The contractor shall provide all necessary software maintenance and support (professional, technical, and other staff as needed for successful contract performance) for the Optimal Satcom, Inc.?s COMPLAN? software and STAR suite (with the Link Analysis, Propagation Analysis, and Antenna Coverage programs).   COMPLAN? is a tool that allows the design of satellite transponder configurations with multiple carriers. Frequencies and power levels can be assigned to individual carriers and then optimized to meet required performance levels with minimum power. COMPLAN? also allows the effects of rain, thermal noise, adjacent carrier and co-channel interference, and intermodulation distortion to be included in the transponder being modeled. The STAR suite is used to help manage satellite communications networks and provides data analysis, data reporting, and mapping capabilities. The STAR suite includes a comprehensive database containing thousands of pieces of information on the INTELSAT and New Skies satellite systems and is useful for performing link budgets, analyzing satellite coverage, performing rain analyses, analyzing the effects of satellite inclination, and plotting antenna beams on a world map.  The term of the contract will be for a one-year period from date of contract award with options to extend for four additional one-year periods, which may be exercised at the Government's discretion subject to availability of funding.   Interested firms must submit adequate documentation of their capability to respond to this requirement in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the posting date of this notice. All documentation submitted shall be sufficient in depth and detail to allow for an evaluation without the need for added information. The Government will not accept oral or incomplete submissions. A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement will be based upon the response to this public notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government. All inquiries concerning this matter shall be submitted in writing to the point of contact, Patricia Ludlow, who can be reached via E-mail at pludlow@ibb.gov. This public notice is not an RFP, RFQ or IFB.

The United States Government is expressing interest in locating office space within the boundaries listed below for  Mine Safety and Health Agency.

The boundaries are within the city limits of Hibbing, Minnesota.

The purpose of this advertisement is to seek information from property owners willing to provide approximately  1,600 - 1,777  square  feet of rentable office  space using a common area factor of 1.15%.   This equates to 1,391 - 1,545 useable square feet of office space.  The agency also requires two (2) surface parking spaces.   The U. S. Government?s existing lease is expiring and the Government is considering if it would be economically advantageous for the Government to relocate.  In addition to the rental costs, the Government will also factor in costs for moving to a new location including, but not limited to, physical move, tenant improvements, above-standard/specialized alterations/equipment, furniture relocation, telecommunications, and other related costs.  Note that these same costs may not be factored in when evaluating whether it is most advantageous to the Government to remain in the current lease location.   Useable or  occupiable space above must be available for use by tenant for personnel, furnishings and equipment.     A lease is required for a ten (10) year/five (5) year firm term. 

Targeted occupancy date is December 2007 or sooner.   The space must be contiguous and on one floor.  The space must be accessible 24/7.   The space offered  must be well maintained and must meet the General Services Administration?s fire, life safety and handicapped accessibility standards. 

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building ownership.

Property owners who have available space are urged to forward pertinent information by mail or FAX by December 4, 2007 responding to SFO-GS-05B-18071

Selection Process:

The selection process shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, Subpart 36.6 Performance-Based Contracting, and the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-852). Clarifications may be requested at any time.  The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1: Screening Phase: during which the SF330 will be evaluated against the selection factor 1-5 listed below to select the most highly qualified firms (the Short List) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

The letter notifying those firms selected for the short list will contain an appointment for one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these sessions will be conducted in the Region?s offices and shall not take longer than two (2) hours.

Each of the short-listed firms shall be given an opportunity for oral presentation, which shall be made by the firm?s key personnel/management team.  After reviewing the Phase 2 submission, a letter will be sent to each of the short listed firms scheduling a date for the firm?s oral presentation and containing a list of questions covering the Phase 2 submission.  Each firm is responsible for ensuring that any required presentation tools and personnel are available and working properly for their presentation.  During the oral presentation, the short-listed firms may be requested to provide further clarification concerning their submission.  After oral presentations, the firms will be evaluated and ranked, based on the information presented in their Phase II submission and Oral presentation. 

Selection factor 1-6 listed below will be used for making the final selection(s).  

Unsuccessful firms and firms selected for negotiation of a contract will be notified.

Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection and will proceed until sufficient awards have been made.

In addition to Factors 1 through 5, Factor 6 will be used to evaluate the firm?s Phase 2 submission (PMP, TWP, and QMP) during Phase 2.  Factor 6 is less important than factors 1, 2 and 3 and more important than Factor 4 and 5.  Should the content of a firm?s PMP, TWP, and QMP impact any of the Phase 1 ratings, the ratings for Phase 1 shall be revised as appropriate. Only Factors 2 and 6 have subfactors.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for engineering services that are needed to assist the government with developing a new analytical tool to establish manufacturing tolerances for reduced signature motors. To meet this requirement NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Alion Science and Technology (AST) located in Chicago, IL 60616.  AST has established a unique expertise of programs, sciences, technology initiatives and has developed analytical predictive tools that other companies could not develop in the timeframe necessary to complete this task and conducting a competitive procurement would result in unacceptable delays and a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. AST has extensive experience in developing novel integral-equation techniques for the computationally efficient solution of complex boundary-value problems, particularly in the field of Electromagnetics of Permanent-Magnet Motors and Acoustics. AST has related experience in homopolor electric motors including thermochemical and electrochemical model development for predictions of wear for current-collecting brush fibers in a homopolar motor; experience in the prediction of the effects of turbulence and mean-flow ingestion by marine and aeronautical propulsors; experience in analysis and code development of the Elasticity and Viscoelasticity of complex structures, the prediction of flow noise from framed treated structures driven by turbulent layers, the development of novel boundry-element techniques for the calculation of nearfield diffraction by complex propulsor components and the calculation of acoustic propagation in flexible waveguides fitted with customized liners. AST has developed specialized computer codes in the above mentioned areas under sponsorship from: ONR, ONR/General Atomics through its Brush Physics initiative, NSWCCD, NASA?s LRC and GRC.   All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 12/13/2007, referencing RFQ N00167-08-T-0017.

<CONTACT>Sara Oletski Contracting Officer 3032366498     Sara_Oletski@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation Number NAR080042 applies and will be issued as a Request for Proposals for the following services: seeding sagebrush on approximately 256,742 acres using Government furnished seed. The project location is located in Owyhee and Twin Falls Counties in Idaho and Elko County in Nevada. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: General - The Contractor shall seed an estimated 256,742 acres of designated areas in conformance with these specifications and the Detailed Specifications.  Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall furnish at work sites applicator(s) experienced in applying seed in rough, rocky or mountainous terrain, all equipment, labor, supplies, and materials required to complete the job.  The Contractor shall service and repair his/her equipment as necessary to maintain satisfactory progress on work.  Estimated start date is between January 7th and January 15th, dependant upon the availability of seed, and all work will be completed within 30 calendar days. Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) - The Contractor shall be required to utilize a DGPS for electronic Navigation.  System must be capable of utilizing Arc View or ARC-INFO shape files created by the government and given to the contractor on a standard HD 1.44 mb, 3.5 inch floppy disk or USB compatible flash memory stick. (1) On the ground flaggers and an auto-flagger system can supplement the DGPS system, but not substitute for it. (2) Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) Navigation - DGPS is required for tracking, and data collection. The Contractor shall provide all guidance equipment, materials, computers, printers, personnel, and services required for the system to be used.  The system shall be sufficiently sensitive to provide immediate deviation indications (real-time).  The DGPS system must be capable of determining a differentially corrected location with an error of no more than one to two meters in the horizontal plane.  The guidance system shall be capable of updating current position at a rate of a minimum of one time per second.  Differential correction must cover the complete operational area.  During operation, differentially corrected signal must be accurately recorded at least 90% of the operational time.  Differential correction may be, provided by a portable differential station, FM radio fixed towers, or satellite.  Software provided with DGPS must be designed for parallel offset in increments equal to the assigned swath width of the application equipment. Base of Operations - The Contractor shall provide such landing facilities as may be required for competent performance of contract. The use of any loading area shall be arranged by and at the discretion and risk of the Contractor, and the Government shall not be held responsible for any loss, mishap, or accident due to conditions of any site used.  The Contractor shall provide appropriate warning signs for traffic if roads are used as loading sites. Equipment - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to satisfactorily seed the designated areas in the time specified as required in the Detailed Specifications.  Equipment shall be capable of traveling at moderate speed and low enough to give proper control and distribution of seed. Communication - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to have communications with the Government either by using radio frequencies designated by the Project Inspector or by providing a radio to the Project Inspector. Seed Bucket(s) or Hopper(s) - Sagebrush seed presents unique problems due to its bulkiness and its tendency to bridge in the seed bucket.  In addition, it is anticipated that a majority of the sagebrush seed will have a high moisture content which causes seed to compact, clump, and bridge even more severely.  Therefore, seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include a mechanical agitation system to prevent the seed from bridging in the bucket or hopper.  Equipment that cannot perform the specified work shall be modified or replaced by the Contractor.  Equipment shall be equipped for carrying seed with an approved distribution mechanism complete with release, shutoff, and spreading device, which can be calibrated for spreading seed at the prescribed rate in a satisfactory manner and uniform pattern.  Seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include lids, which fasten securely to prevent seed from blowing out. Seeder Calibration - The Contractor shall calibrate seeding equipment prior to application on the project.  The Government will supply seed for calibration.  However, the seed may not be available until approximately two days prior to the approximate start date of the project.  Seed used for calibration shall be recovered for use on the project. Seed - The seed will be furnished by the Government at the location stated in the Detailed Specifications.  Contractor shall load and transport seed from the pickup point to the operational loading sites and shall be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or any other hazard.  Any seed damaged or lost, while in the custody of the Contractor, will be replaced by the Government, and actual cost to the Government for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  All unused seed shall be returned to the pickup point by the Contractor or nearer destination, if so directed, upon completion of work or termination of the contract.  All empty seed bags shall be tied in bundles of 25 bags each and returned to the Government by the Contractor. Seeding Operation - Rate of seeding - Seed shall be distributed at the rate stated in the Detailed Specifications, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Some seeding rates may be slightly reduced due to availability of seed.  The following is a list of the quantities for the required seeding: Wyoming Big Sagebrush .5 lbs / 217,555 acres Low Sagebrush 1.0 lbs / 29,824 acres Mountain Big Sagebrush .5 lbs / 9,363 acres The rate of seeding above is based on bulk seed rates, this number may change due to seed availability. This is a 100% set-aside for small business.  The standard NAICS classification is 115112.  Size standard is $6.5 million.  The Government intends to award this contract on an all-or-none basis. The solicitation will be issued on or about December 5, 2007.  The solicitation may be downloaded from the IDEASEC website:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.5 to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.  The contract will require BIDMC to jointly develop specifications for a standardized request for medical evidence and response, and an associated implementation guide based on standards approved by the Health Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) and other widely used industry standards.  The contract period will be approximately nine months.  

The objective of the project will be to evaluate the feasibility, technical alternatives, and potential value of leveraging electronic communication along with structured clinical information with healthcare providers for the disability claims process. A standardized process and associated implementation guides will be developed to leverage provider-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) to generate responses to electronic requests from SSA with no human intervention using standard electronic transactions transmitting structured clinical information, which could result in quicker decisions on disability claims.

As appropriate, these standards will be presented and championed through Standards Development Organizations, the American Health Information Community, HITSP, etc.  The standards to be used include as examples, but are not limited to, ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT, Morphology Codes, HCPCS, LOINC and SNOMED CT.

This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to John Andrews via e-mail at john.t.andrews@ssa.gov no later than 3:00 p.m. EST, November 30, 2007.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Hamamatsu Corporation for the purchase of ten Silicon Photodiodes.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Atomic Physics Division at NIST requires several silicon photodiodes that have the highest quantum efficiency possible at the wavelength where NIST?s experiments work 795 nm.  This requires a silicon photodiode with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency which detects all the light entering the surface of the detector as well as an anti-reflection coating specifically for this wavelength so that all the light that strikes the detector goes in and is not reflected.  Therefore, the silicon photodiode must have the following:  a greater than 99 percent internal quantum efficiency, an active area size 10 nm x 10 nm, maximum capacitance 40 pf, noise equivalent power less than 0.1 picowatt-per-root-hertz, an anti-reflection coating for 795 nm light, and an overall (internal plus external) diode quantum efficiency of 98 percent (minimum 95 percent).  Hamamatsu Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the photodiodes that are required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 7, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Christina Nigro, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3125
<DESC>The US Army, Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Command (JM&L LCMC),  Picatinny, NJ, anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of the Shock Attenuating Lifting Plugs for the 155mm, High Explosive  (HE), M795 Projectiles.  The RFP will be for one production year with options for an additional four production years, totaling production possibilities of  up to five years.  The 155mm, HE, M795 Projectiles is comprised of three  components: the Metal Parts, the Wooden Pallets, and the Lifting Plugs. The  Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug is installed for transportation and handling  purposes in the 155mm, HE, M795.  Before firing, the plug is removed and a  detonating fuse is installed in the nose of the projectile.  The lifting plug  acts as a shock absorber in the critical nose area of the projectile where high  stress may occur.  The plug has the design capability of bending under low  stresses and breaking if the stresses become too high.  Under high stress, the  lifting plug will shear in a way that will prevent the fuse from being  installed.  The Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug renders the projectile safe and  unusable if it is inadvertently subjected to a drop on its nose that exceeds  design limits.  The Lifting Plugs are to be made from malleable iron casting  (i.e. ASTM A47 or ASTM A602), with a 2.000-12 UNS thread, a flange diameter of  approximately 3.80 inches and an outer loop diameter of approximately 1.80  inches.  It is anticipated that there will be delivery requirements of up to  150,000 Plugs during the base year (12,500 Plugs per month), with potential  option quantities of up to an additional 400,000 Lifting Plugs over the four  option years.  This includes machining equipment, metal finishing facilities,  and packaging equipment.  This production volume will also necessitate the use  of dedicated gaging equipment.  The Request for Proposal which will address a  requirement to produce these Shock Attenuating Lifting Plugs, will be posted on  or about 14 December 2007.  The point of contact for this requirement is  Christina Nigro, AMSML-AQ-AC, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email:  Christina.Nigro@us.army.mil. Numbered Notes 1 and 8 apply to this acquisition.

DESCRIPTION

(Note:  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Addendum 8 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)

Despite the recent development of a wide variety of chemo-sensors, the accurate detection and identification of known and unknown chemicals and mixtures of chemicals (i.e., explosives, chemical and biological weapons) remains a critical military need. The limited performance range on current detection methods, with regard to odorant identification, odorant recognition in mixtures, and chemo-sensing across multiple classes of compounds, stands in stark contrast to the innate ability of the mammalian olfactory system - specifically the canine system - to handle these challenging tasks with ease. The canine olfactory system is able to detect thousands of chemicals with high selectivity and specificity using only biological components.  

Recent breakthroughs in the genetics of the olfactory system and in expression systems for mammalian olfactory receptors have presented the opportunity to create a ?nose? constructed from biologic components. The goal of the DARPA RealNose program is to build a ?nose? constructed from actual olfactory receptors that further leverages the components of the canine olfactory system to create a breakthrough detection system with potential capabilities beyond that of a canine. The key to the program concept is that by simulating the entire mammalian olfactory system (from air intake to pattern recognition), revolutionary detection capabilities will be created, demonstrating canine-comparable specificity, distance, and detection thresholds.

RealNose efforts should model, design, and develop a novel sensor inspired by the canine?s olfactory system to include:  air/odor intake, a detector layer (which includes olfactory receptors), a rapid (within seconds) signal transduction methodology, and a signal processing/pattern recognition methodology for identifying odors and odor classes. Note that with the exception of the olfactory receptors themselves, components of the RealNose system do not need to be derived from biologics; bio-inspired, biomimetic, and other approaches are suitable. The integration of these components into the resulting RealNose device will produce a revolutionary olfactory capability for chemical identification.  

The first phase of the program focuses on the development of the individual component technologies and their integration into a breadboard system with limited odorant identification testing. The second phase focuses on the development of a brassboard sensor system with identification of an increasing number of odorant molecules, mixture testing and classification of unknowns. The specific Phase I/II milestones are presented under the Program Goals and Milestones section.

DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to end system) designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations including a lead-integrator for scientific and programmatic continuity. DARPA is not aware of any single company or institution capable of spanning the requisite technical breadth and anticipates that a highly interdisciplinary team will be required to perform the effort. Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to the DARPA RealNose solicitation. A teaming website, http://www.sainc.com/RealNoseTeaming, will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise. Additionally, an Industry Day is being planned for January 15, 2008, to facilitate technical exchange between interested entities and full details will be announced via separate posting. 

BACKGROUND
DARPA seeks innovative proposals that address the following technical areas listed below. Note that a successful proposal must address (but is not limited to) ALL components listed, as well as system integration.  

Odorant Intake
Develop an odorant intake system that mimics the capabilities of the canine nasal cavity. Modeling of the canine nasal cavity may be necessary to understand the cavity?s flow profiles and the relationship to the spatial distribution of receptors and temporal component of odorant/receptor interactions.  

Detector Layer
Develop an appropriate detection layer that may include a nasal mucosal layer, odorant separation technique, and an olfactory receptor layer (required). It has been demonstrated that the mucosal layer acts similarly to a gas chromatograph by partially separating molecules in complex mixtures prior to interacting with olfactory receptors. Identification of coding sequences for specific olfactory receptor proteins of interest should continue to enable detection of as many chemicals as possible in a final system. The spatial distribution of individual odorant receptor genes within the epithelium should also be considered. Note that only systems that utilize olfactory receptors as detectors will be considered. The device must be designed to work in outdoor air and be capable of handling particulates, moisture, and aerosolized or gaseous contaminants.

Signal Transduction Methodology
Develop a signal transduction methodology that can transduce odorant binding to a receptor and that mimics/utilizes the second messenger cascade of the mammalian olfactory system. Methods that harness or replicate this second messenger signaling cascade and signal amplification are critical to developing a usable readout for the RealNose device. This readout capability may generate optical or electrical signals. Methods that utilize gene-expression as an output are not preferred.
 
Pattern Recognition Methodology
Develop a pattern recognition methodology for specific odorants and odorant/chemical classes through a sophisticated data analysis approach. This may include neural-networks, high-dimensional data approaches or other novel methods. This methodology should mimic the signal amplification and pattern recognition aspects of the olfactory neural pathway to enable a highly sensitive and specific RealNose device. Both spatial and temporal components of the network and biological signal processing schemes should be considered to enable odorant identification that approaches the canine capability. Any proposed solution must eventually be capable of identifying an unknown analyte based on comparison with a library of known chemicals.

Successful responders to the above listed technical areas must be able to quantitatively and analytically express how their solutions will meet the goals stated above and provide previous experimental evidence, if applicable. Proposers should plan for the test and evaluation of their components and device within each phase length (i.e., breadboard, brassboard, and prototype).  Please note that proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies may be considered noncompliant to this BAA Addendum.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES
The goal of the DARPA RealNose program is to build a prototype ?nose? that simulates the entire canine olfactory system to create a breakthrough detection system for known and unknown odorants with potential sensitivity and specificity beyond a canine?s.  

Program Phases
The RealNose Program will be separated into three phases. The goal of Phase I is to develop requisite component technologies and demonstrate the ability of a breadboard RealNose device to detect and identify 5 individual chemicals at the canine level of detection threshold for each molecule. The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate detection and identification of individual chemicals within a mixture of 5 to 10 chemicals, and classify 1-3 unknowns with a brassboard system. The goal of Phase III will be to develop a functional prototype system that can detect and identify 25 known and unknown chemicals - with direct application to transition customer(s).

Phase I should not exceed 15 months and Phase II should not exceed 12 months. Note that shorter duration efforts are strongly encouraged.

A successful proposal will thoroughly discuss all details for meeting the milestones set forth for both Phase I and Phase II. Proposals should encompass both Phase I and an optional executable Phase II, including detailed budgets for both phases, as well as a brief discussion of the pathway towards a Phase III prototype. At the end of each phase, performance will be evaluated based on achievement of the stated milestones. Successful completion of Phase I does not guarantee selection to proceed to Phase II.

Program Milestones
The RealNose Phase I milestones are:

1.	Demonstrate methods for high throughput identification of olfactory receptor genes of interest, stable expression of receptor proteins, and maintaining olfactory receptors in a stable and functional state.
2.	Demonstrate methods for reliable ?read-out? of analyte binding to/interacting with receptors via direct measurement.  
3.	Develop a breadboard system composed of each RealNose system component: air/odor intake, a detector layer, signal transduction methodology, and a signal processing/pattern recognition methodology. 
4.	Phase I Go/No-Go Metric:  Demonstrate the breadboard?s ability to detect and identify 5 individual chemicals, potentially in a chemical mixture.  The device should operate/identify at the canine level of detection (LOD), at a probability of detection greater than 80% (PD greater than 80%), and be able to distinguish relative chemical concentrations.  Potential chemicals include, but are not limited to, those listed below in Table 1.

Table 1.  Potential Phase I Compounds
No. 1:  Cyclohexanone, Canine LOD = 10 ppb
No. 2:  Methyl Benzoate, Canine LOD = 10 ppb
No. 3:  2, 4 DNT, Canine LOD = 0.5 ppb
No. 4:  n- Amyl Acetate, Canine LOD = 2 ppt
No. 5: Limonene (+/-), Canine LOD = 10 ppm

The RealNose Phase II milestones are:

1.	Develop and demonstrate an integrated brassboard RealNose system.
2.	Demonstrate the ability to classify unknown chemicals within a mixture based on previous interactions with known molecules using the brassboard system.
3.	Phase II Go/No-Go Metric:  Demonstrate the brassboard?s ability to detect and identify 10 individual odorants/chemicals, with a portion contained in a chemical mixture. The chemicals should be detected at the canine level of detection (LOD), at a probability of detection greater than 90% (PD greater than 90%), and distinguish relative chemical concentrations. Additional chemicals include, but are not limited to, heptanal, acetophenone, eugenol, ethyl vanillin, and 2-heptanone. The LOD for the potential chemicals will be provided in Phase II.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-20.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SSSAB) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order with Yale University,Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Biochemical Engineering to collaborate with NIH/NIMH to perform and oversee the TKM processing in NIH Pet images of the brain tissue radioactivity acquired by the scanner software must be converted into physiologically meaningful images in which the component values are translated into quantitiative measures of parameters such as receptor concentration, blood flow using the process of TKM. The application of TKM constitutes a complex set of operations that typically depend upon the involvement, oversight and quality control of a physicist/chemical engineer who has received highly specialized training and experience in implementing TKM for a variety of PET radioligands. The NIMH IRP Section on Neuroimaging in Mood and Anxiety Disorders (SNMAD) is engaged in several protocols that employ positron tomography (PET) to investigate the binding potential of various types of brain receptors in patients suffering from mood and anxiety disorders.  These studies hold great potential for informing clinical neuroscience about the pathophysiology of these conditions which performs the essential services of applying Tracer Kinetic Modeling (TKM) to transform the primary PET image data that NIMH acquire in research studies into quantitative measures of neuroreceptor binding potential. These services are under several NIMH protocols and another source could cause significant delays. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is except from FAR 6 based upon FAR Part 13. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement in writing within (10) ten calendar days from the posted date of this notice.

<DESC>The following questions and respective answers are hereby provided for clarification purpose:   Q1.  The 11 listed objectives for the base year seem not to include all of the usual tasks required in the eRate process including, filing of Form 486, processing SPIN changes, PIA reviews, filing BEAR forms, etc.   Can we assume that these additional tasks should be included in any proposal?   R1.   No.  The school and staff of the BIE will complete the process for this application year once the Form 471 process and Objective 11 (Receipt Acknowledgement letter) has been completed for Year 11.    Q2.  Under qualifications of provider item 1b indicates that the ?contractor shall have experience building infrastructure for school.?   Is the expectation that the eRate provider must also have the resources for installing a school network?    R2.   No, There is no expectation that the eRate provider must have resources for installing a school network.   Q1.  A daily rate is requested for an unspecified number of objectives in an unspecified number of schools.   Since different objectives may require different skill-sets we are considering a daily per person rate for each objective.   Not knowing the extent of a given task (number of schools, size of schools), we cannot estimate, at this point, what will be the fully cost of completing a task.  Are these correct assumptions?    R3.   A daily rate is requested because there is a finite period of time to perform the work.    An hourly rate can be proposed.   It is true that the number of schools, is unknown.   The set of objectives required for the different schools is also unknown.   However, the schools have been asked to gather their respective data and put it into a format that will be useful for completing the application process.  Additionally, the existing staff who works these issues with the schools will share with the winning vendor(s).   The goal is to make wise choices, given the available data and input from the schools leading to as many complete applications as time permits.  Due the unknowns the IDIQ contract vehicle is being utilized for this requirement.  Each task order shall defninitize the number of days or hours required to provide service to a definitized number of schools as well as identify what objectives will be required to perform each task order.      As a result of the responses delineated above the following information is hereby incorporated into the combined synopsis/solicitation:   The school and staff of the BIE will complete the process for this application year once the Form 471 process and Objective 11 (Receipt Acknowledgement letter) has been completed for Year 11.   There is no expectation that the eRate provider must have resources for installing a school network.   The daily rate proposed shall be for an 8 hour day.   The company may submit an hourly rate as well.   The daily rate and the hourly rate shall be submitted for each objective delineated in the SOW for the basic and the option year.   Each task order shall issued against the IDIQ contract shall defninitize the unknowns, such as the number of days or hours required to provide the service to a definitized number of schools, location for the performance of the task order, identify what objectives will be required to perform each task order, etc...   The due date for the receipt of quotes is hereby extended from November 29, 2007, 9:00am local time to Friday, November 30, 2007, 8:00am, local time.

<DESC>UPDATE, 28 NOV 07 ------------THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN CANCELLED----------The Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) intends to issue a Request For Proposal for the procurement of training transition facilitators throughout Iraq in Support of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I) on or about 23 Oct 07.  The Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT) has requirements for contractors to assist the Iraqi Government in the development, organization, training, and sustainment of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).  The Training Transition Facilitator Contract will procure services to train ISF trainers, leaders, and commanders in the implementation and execution of training programs designed to build individual leader skills; squad, platoon, and company collective task and battlefield operating systems skills; and battalion staff collective task skills.   The primary purpose of these services is to develop doctrine and training curriculum, and to facilitate the implementation and execution of approved training curriculum.  Contractor personnel will be embedded with Iraqi Security Force (ISF) personnel in order to facilitate the training process.  

To efficiently and effectively fulfill these requirements the MNSTC-I Support Division intends to award a single award, Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The resultant contract will be comprised of a one year base period with two, one-year option periods.  The anticipated award date for any resultant contract is 20 Dec 07.  Award will be made pursuant to a written solicitation which will be made available through http://www.baghdadbusinesscenter.org and on the Rebuilding Iraq web site at https://www.rebuilding-iraq.net .  JCC-I/A will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE only, to identify firms capable of providing the Supplies/Items as described below.   The US Coast Guard has identified a need for a contractor to provide the materials for a CCTV Closed Circuit Television System. 


The USCG C2CEN Portsmouth, VA intends to issue a Fixed Price Contract/Purchase Order in reference to a formal Solicitation that may follow, to meet the need as defined above.
CCTV System requirements are as follows:
1.  Scalability- the solution must work for systems having 2-50 cameras and 1-10 operators.
2.  Frame Rates- the system must display a minimum of 9 camera images on a single monitor at a frame rate not less than 15 frames/second for all images.
3.  Image Resolution- System will support CIF (2CIF or 4CIF should also be supported) at a minimum of 15 frames/sec.  If the selected resolution lowers the frame rate below 15 frames/sec, it should be noted.  
4.  Video Encoder Support- the system must support Verint encoders as a minimum unless another solution is very compelling (H.264?).  Points will be added for proprietary and non-proprietary support.
5.  Display- to support the display of multiple cameras at higher resolutions on larger monitors, output must be SXGA (1280 X 1024) or higher.
6.  Configuration Control- must support the creation of custom views of multiple cameras (view two large and three small, camera video displays for example).  The system must support the selection of multiple pre-defined views.  
7.  Control- must support P/T/Z/F/Wiper and multiple protocols (Pelco "D" is primary).  Must support variable speed pan/tilt controls.  A joystick must be available as an option.  If controlled by a mouse, a keyboard must not be required for camera control and selection, configuration selection, and record/replay. 
8.  Record/replay- must record all cameras for a minimum of 32 days, but they may be recorded at a reduced frame rate down to 1 frame/sec.  The system must support playback at the operator's workstation without a loss of real-time feeds.  The system must support the offload of video segments.  Points will be added for the ability to view, record, and store a single image. 
9.  Open Architecture- the system must provide a documented open interface that would allow other applications to access control, live video, and stored data.  Preferably, this would be a System-Oriented Architecture.
10. Web Support- the ability to view live/recorded video from a common browser. 
11. Video Stream from remote cameras- maximum rate is 1Mb/s per camera.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of a customer agency (the U.S. Access Board) is posting this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research to determine the availability of vendors that provide comprehensive seat management solutions for small government agencies.

The agency desires a contractor that can provide comprehensive and integrated desktop and local area network services and telephony capability. The objective of the contract is to establish and sustain effective and efficient managed support of the information technology infrastructure with a single-point-of-contact contractor.  To achieve this objective, the contractor must provide and support a solution that includes but is not limited to:
?	Design and configuration of the integrated desktop and telephone system,

o	Desktop computer system,  It is anticipated that the ?desktop system? will feature powerful laptop computers for each employee (about 30), desk docking stations, the associated servers for network management, e-mail, web testing, document storage, and printing.  (The Board currently has CAT 5 Ethernet wiring for its network.  A vendor may propose upgrade in the Board?s network cabling.)
o	A new state-of-the-art telephone system, The Board believes that the new system should feature voice-over-the-internet-protocol, but is willing to consider other options.  The Board is seeking an integrated telephone system which includes unified messaging, TTY capabilities, including support for VCO/HCO users.  In addition, an accessible integrated telephone system would provide universal access to all telephone functions and information.  The Board would also want a limited number of smart phones or Personal Digital Assistants provided.

?	Installation, testing, and acceptance, 
?	Operations and network management, 
?	An ISP that can assume total management of the Board?s internet accounts including hosting of the Access Board?s web site (www.access-board.gov),
?	User support including software support, hardware support, and training, 
?	Asset management, 
?	Disaster recovery, file backup, and continuity of operations,
?	A secure virtual private network so Access Board employees can use the network remotely,
?	A remote network and e-mail server that is part of the Access Board?s continuity of operations plan,
?	Compliance with all applicable Federal information security requirements,
?	Ability to provide web site development assistance and application development assistance,
?	Demonstrated ability to meet strict service levels.  (Under the Board?s current contract the vendor is assessed a penalty if the network system or a users workstation is ?down? for over 4 hours. A vendor must demonstrate a history and provide a methodology to meet these service parameters.)
?	A refresh of the hardware and software in the system every 3 years and,
?	 Demonstration of the proposed systems compliance with the Section 508 accessibility requirements, including an integrated TTY solution.  (The government will supply some assistive technology, for example screen reading software or a refreshable Braille display, and the vendor must demonstrate knowledge of common assistive technology.)

This RFI is only market research to determine the existence of seat management solutions. In addition to providing a capabilities statement to show that your company currently performs these services, please provide your company size standard. If you hold a GSA schedule for these services please include contract number.

Your response should be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov no later than close of business on December 12, 2007.  In your response, please reference RFI-ABA-08-0003 in the subject line.  Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes only.  This notice is not a solicitation.

Primarily, the translator software will be used by subject matter experts (SME) involved in the development and production support of the Electronic Claims (eClaims), Electronic Medicare Remittance Advice (eMRA), Electronic Payments (ePayments), Electronic Pharmacy Claims (ePharmacy), and Electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) initiatives to translate and process data.  Secondarily, the translator will be used to provide user customizable reporting, including transaction processing reports and content specific reports in a standard format. Translator services must work on a Microsoft or UNIX server platform and be scalable to meet increased transaction amounts.  The software must provide customization based on customer specifications, handle multiple mapping schemas, and provide and regulate scheduled version upgrades, including upgrades to HIPAA ASC X12 standards and code sets as required by mandate (5010). Specifically: 1.  The CBO EDI transactions that are processed by the VA FSC include X12N 837 and NCPDP (healthcare electronic claims), X12N 835 (electronic remittance advice and EFT information) and X12N 270/271 (electronic eligibility inquiries and responses). These transactions are currently routed through the Emdeon and PNC Bank clearinghouses. These transactions are received and sent in a flat file or HL7 format from the VA Medical Centers. The VA FSC translates the data to and from the flat file format to X12N/NCPDP transaction sets. 2.  The VA FSC processes 160,000 NCPDP transactions per month. Anticipated NCPDP volume in FY08 is approximately 300,000 per month. 3.  The VA FSC sends and receives approximately 50,000 eligibility inquiries and responses (270/271) transactions per month. The CBO expects that connections with new payers along with scheduled software enhancements will result in a tripling of the volume.

<CONTACT>Sherri Brown, 876-2105
<DESC>The Government hereby requests information regarding the technical and financial capabilities of Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms, to include Native Hawaiian Organization (NHO) owned, Native American Tribally owned or Alaska N ative Corporation (ANC) owned certified 8(a) concerns, to perform Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) support requirements as outlined below.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any costs  expended by any interested parties in responding to this notice.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  This is a sources sought notice only and is not a Request for Proposal ( RFP). BACKGROUND: For information purposes only.  The PIF is currently supported by the Joint Venture between Yulista Management Services and Science and Engineering Services (JVYS) under contract DAAH-01-02-C-R190 and W3IP4Q-06-C-R190.  Yulista, the majority jo int venture partner, is an Alaska Native Corporation.  The contract, with a ceiling of $1.4 Billion and a 10-year period of performance, was awarded June 2002. In FY07 contract requirements exceeded $340 Million; total contract value to date is approximate ly $970M. The U.S. Armys Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) anticipates a requirement for a support contract to provide labor, materials, and facilities to support the Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) at Redstone Arsenal , AL.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement will be 336413, size standard 1,000 employees.  The PIF provides an organic, rapid response capability for generating hardware solutions.  Housed in six buildings at Redstone Arsenal, AL, and off-site c ontractor facilities in the local area, the PIF is designed to rapidly respond to hardware requirements.  Government owned and government operated, the PIF offers single source convenience, turn-key solutions for development, fabrication, systems integrati on, modification, experimentation, and subsystem/system level testing.  Specific capabilities include: design and analysis, modeling and simulation, rapid prototyping, mechanical fabrication, printed wiring board fabrication, circuit card assembly, cable a nd chassis fabrication, ground and air platform integration, aircraft modification, field retrofits and sustainment support both locally and abroad. This anticipated effort includes, but is not limited to, the following: comprehensive program management, engineering, fabrication, subsystem/system integration, qualification testing, logistical and maintenance support to DoD hardware (including but not l imited to aviation and missile weapon systems).  Additionally, this may include design conceptualization, re-design, engineering analysis, technology insertion, rapid prototyping, repair, fabrication, testing, calibration, and fielding.  The contractor may  also be tasked to perform hardware/software engineering, trouble shoot subsystems, perform quality assurance support, provide configuration management and prepare logistic support for systems, subsystems and test-beds.  This support will also include a fu ll spectrum of engineering and manufacturing capability to reverse/re-engineer, produce and support the management of production systems/subsystems or components. Familiarization with DoD Critical Safety Item (CSI) program and the Army Aviation Air Worthin ess Release (AWR) process is required.  History has shown that it is imperative that the prime contractor have (or be capable of developing) an extensive network of subcontractors and material vendors to address the broad scope of work, and rapidly evolvin g task order requirements.  The prime must be structured in a manner to be flexible to the Governments requirements, increasing support during periods of growth and reducing support during periods of decreased workload. This potential req uirement is being considered for Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms to include Native Hawaiian Organization (NHO) owned, Native American Tribally Owned, or Alaskan Native Corporation (ANC) owned certified 8(a) concerns, subject to the  availability of funds. This notice also announces the Governments intent to hold an informational conference and site visit on December 20, 2007 at Redstone Arsenal, AL, to further define the PIFs interest areas. U.S. Citizenship will be required to attend the informational co nference and site visit.  Interested sources, as described above, are highly encouraged to submit a request to attend this conference to Mrs. Dana Holmes via email; dana.holmes@us.army.mil, no later than December 7, 2007.  No telephone calls will be accept ed.  Participation by foreign sources is prohibited.  Each company will be limited to a maximum of 4 persons.  The names and proof of U.S. citizenship of each person associated with each company should be forwarded with your request to attend.  Directions and visitor access will be emailed in a response.  It is anticipated that interested sources will be offered the opportunity to present a written capabilities briefing and backup information no later than January 18, 2008.    If necessary, the Government m ay invite qualified firms to present a one hour verbal briefing on January 28, January 29, or January 30, 2008.  The Government will coordinate all verbal briefs, as required. Place of Contract Performance: Primarily at Redstone Arsenal, AL, and in local contractor provided facilities off-post.

<SUBJECT>70 -- INTENT TO AWARD: ZYCUS MODEL MAINTENANCE
<DESC>This serves as a "Notice of Intent" to award a modification to exercise an option to Zycus, to provide Model Maintenance Software and Annual maintenance for Autoclass Batch 1.5x and AutoClass Live Connect 1.5 Licenses for a period of performance of DOA through end of FY08. This is for the GSA Federal Acquisition Service Office of the Chief Information Officer. This is a commercial item. Orginal posting of the requirement was Posted on FEDBIZOPS Nov 3, 2005 and closed Nov. 24, 2005. It was for one base year and three, one-year option periods to be exercised at the Government's discretion. {FAR 52.242-19, Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, applicable}. This purchase was conducted in direct response to a GAO Report, which cited the need to improve catalogue capability and recommended Zycus as the company best suited to the task. The proprietary Zycus model maintenance software license is not currently available on GSA Schedule. Therefore, it was purchased open market from Zycus and the requirement to extend the option has risen. Because the Chief Information Officer has determined that Zycus continues to meet the needs of the requirements and there is no reason to convert to a new environement, the option will be exercised. All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquistition to Traci Walker (703-605-2608, email: traci.walker@gsa.gov) This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.

<SUBJECT>RFI for Dry Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS)
<DESC>SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY for a host submarine launched, Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) that will continue to provide theater Special Operation Forces (SOF) commanders the operational capability to conduct SOF shallow water undersea operations, while providing a dry environment to SOF SWCS operators and personnel during transit.  This dry SWCS will adhere to the requirements for certification listed in the U.S Navy System Certification Procedure and Criteria Manual for Deep Submergence Systems (SS800-AG-MAN-010/P9290).  Note that Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is conducting multiple marketing surveys in support of various methods of conducting the shallow water mission.  This RFI is one in a series of such RFIs that support that mission. BACKGROUND:  Mark VIII SEAL Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) have been in service for several decades.  As free-flooding ??wet?? vehicles, the operators transit to the operational site in a wet, often cold or hot, environment breathing from SCUBA gear.  Accordingly, they arrive at the operational site in less than optimum physical condition to begin the mission ashore.  It is desirable to determine the feasibility of a SWCS in which the occupants can transit in a dry environment.   The Navy and SOCOM are now also considering a new design of the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) with a hangar up to 10 feet longer than current DDSs.  This new DDS, if built, could accommodate SWCS vehicles up to 10 feet longer than current SDVs.   OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS:  The new dry SWCS will clandestinely transport SOF personnel and equipment in a dry environment into littoral waters and harbors.  The SWCS must provide the capability for personnel and equipment to exit and re-enter the vehicle while submerged, without releasing bubbles to the surface.  The new dry SWCS must address a wide range of operational challenges including the growing ability of hostile nations to detect, identify and target SOF conducting undersea tasks.  Thus, this SWCS will have a modular subsystem design conducive to accommodating upgrades to processors and sensors.  This dry SWCS will improve the Mk VIII Mod 1 SDV current capability of moving SOF operators and equipment payload through shallow water.  Moreover, the dry SWCS will increase current payload limitations while offering extended tactical mission duration not available with use of the Mk VIII Mod 1 SDV.  In similar fashion to the Mk VIII SDV, the new SWCS will be compatible with !  designated DDS configured submarines which will continue to serve as the primary host for future SOF undersea mobility platforms.  As a result, the new dry SWCS will have the necessary interfaces to be stowed in the host DDS for required maintenance and replenishment. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  These general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:   A)	Passengers/Crew: * B)	Cargo payload: * C)	Minimum Operational Water Depth:  	Permit safe operations, specifically including offload and onload of personnel and payload, in water depth as shallow as 10 feet seawater [Objective] 	Permit safe operations, specifically including offload and onload of personnel and payload, in water depth as shallow as 15 feet seawater [Threshold] D)	Combat Radius: * E)	Launch and Recovery/ DDS SDV Track & Cradle Compatibility:   	Automated launch and recovery without requiring the assistance of support personnel exposed to sea pressure [Objective] 	Diver-aided launch and recovery compatible with current SDV launch and recovery track and cradle platform on current DDS [Threshold] F)	NET-Ready: 	100% of interfaces; services; policy-enforcement controls; and data correctness, availability and processing requirements in the Joint integrated architecture.

<SUBJECT>54 -- Prefabricated Stuctures FSC 5410/5411
<DESC>FedBizOpps Notice 
FPI Production of Prefabricated and Portable Buildings
FSC codes 5410 and 5411



In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors? directive to seek and pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily(CBD) regarding FPI?s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18.U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  
This notice announces FPI?s intentions to produce prefabricated and portable buildings for federal agencies on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status. Once a product is sold competitively, by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI?s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI?s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).  

1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.   

2. Description of Action - Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for the annual subscription and maintenance support services for the NS Elite and Open Link Enterprise software.  The NS Elite software allows a personal computer to access the Federal Bureau of Prisons mainframe computer applications.  

3. Description of Supplies and Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs - Inclusive of the Estimated Value - The BOP requires the annual software maintenance services for the NS Elite and Open Link Enterprise.  The software maintenance services will include twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance.  

The estimated value of the annual software maintenance is $93,700.00.  

4. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - 
FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - 
(1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). 

5. Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP requires maintenance and support for the NS Elite and Open Link Enterprise software which allows a personal computer to emulate a 3270 display device, which is required to access the BOP mainframe.  Without this software, BOP personal computers would not be able to access any mainframe applications including SENTRY, National Finance Center (NFC), National Crime Information Center (NCIC), among other mainframe systems.  All of these mainframes are integrated components of our daily operations at the BOP.  Without the maintenance of the NS Elite and Open Link Enterprise software, access to SENTRY, NFC, NCIC and other mainframe systems will cease to exist.  The agency's need for the services listed above can only be provided by one source.  NetManage owns the propriety rights to this software and have only allowed Spectrum Systems, Inc. to resell the services to the government.  The services required are not available from any other sources.  

6. Efforts to Obtain Competition - A combined synopsis/solicitation notice will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fedbizopps.gov, which will offer notice of the BOP's intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Spectrum Systems, Inc. and request quotations from interested parties.  

7. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost  Determination - A review of Spectrum Systems, Inc. proposed price was completed by the contracting officer.  Based on the submittal from Spectrum Systems, Inc., historical prices, and additional market research, it was determined that the quote is acceptable to the Government.  This product has been retired and is no longer being offered to the current market.  The price offered by Spectrum Systems, Inc. is 6% higher than the price they proposed last fiscal year, which they have offered the BOP as a legacy support due to the size and nature of the installation at the BOP.  The price offered by Spectrum Systems, Inc. is considered fair and reasonable based on market research, historical data, and previously paid prices.  

8. Market Survey - A combined synopsis/solicitation  notice will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fedbizopps.gov, which will offer notice of the BOP's intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Spectrum Systems, Inc. and request quotations from interested parties.  

9. Other Factors - The maintenance and service support is required to maintain the NS Elite and Open Link Enterprise software to allow access to mainframe systems.  Lack of maintenance for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as this software allow employees access to various mainframes that control and direct many aspects of the daily operations for the BOP.  

10. List of Sources - NetManage owns the proprietary rights to the NS Elite and Open Link Enterprise software, and has only authorized reseller authority to Spectrum Systems, Inc.  

11. Action to be Taken to Promote Future Competition - Not Applicable.  

12. Contracting Officer's Certification -  I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
//s// Kristina M. Sullivan, Contract Specialist, National Acquisition Section

13. Technical Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Limited Source Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Requirements Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Limited Source Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Performance Work Statement (PWS)

Upgrade of the Intelligent System for Heat  Exchanger Design  (ISHED) to Enable Optimum Condenser Designs and Improve Robustness

A.	Background Information

In 2003, the HVAC&R Equipment Performance Group completed a simulation package containing first principles-based simulation models for finned-tube air-to-refrigerant evaporators and condensers, called EVAP-COND.  Since its placement on the Building Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) website  (http://www2.bfrl.nist.gov/software/evap-cond/) in February 2003, over 2000 organizations (manufacturers, academia and consultants) from over 40 countries have downloaded this simulation package.  EVAP-COND facilitates the development of refrigerant circuitry designs through a combination of sophisticated heat exchanger simulators and an effective visual user interface. The interface allows the design engineer to specify a refrigerant circuitry architecture in a graphical manner.  Upon completion of the simulation run, the design engineer may use the interface to display a detailed set of performance parameters, which will help him/her to specify a better circuitry architecture for the next simulation run.  A description of EVAP-COND is provided in the EVAP-COND?s Help menu.

The recent developments in machine learning ? as incorporated in ISHED (Intelligent System for Heat Exchange Design, Domanski et al, 2004) ? allow an engineer to improve the heat exchanger design through automated optimization of refrigerant circuitry.   In 2005, the HVAC&R Equipment Performance Group expanded the EVAP-COND interface to incorporate ISHED into an EVAP-COND software package, EVAP-COND/ISHED. At the same time, extensive testing of ISHED continued to cover the whole range of simulation capabilities of the EVAP-COND simulation models, including various refrigerants. At this point of development, ISHED?s operation is stable and robust during optimization runs of evaporator circuitries.  However, our tests showed that ISHED has stability problems specific to condenser design and that it lacks the ability to readily explore multi-tube-merging circuitry configurations which are hardly ever used in evaporators but are common in condensers.  The tests also demonstrated that some of the current design constraints enforced within ISHED are compatible with optimized evaporator designs but are inherently bad for condenser performance, if implemented. Consequently, an additional level of sophistication needs to be introduced into the ISHED module so that it can successfully optimize condenser circuitries while maintaining the current capability to optimize evaporator circuitries.

B.	Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement 

The purpose of this procurement is to upgrade ISHED in the following areas:

Item (a) 
Implement a rule that generated condenser refrigerant circuitry architectures must locate all inlet tubes in the heat exchanger?s last dept row.  Additionally,  implement an optional rule, that all exit tubes in the condenser refrigerant circuitry must locate in the heat exchanger?s first depth row; ?optional rule? means that the user can enable or disable this rule via an input parameter COND_EXIT_FRONT read by ISHED from a file ISHED.PAR located in directory \ISHED.  In all cases, the number of outlet tubes cannot exceed the number of inlet tubes, i.e., the generated condenser circuitries will have a merging or parallel flow configuration. 

Item (b)
Experiment, define, and implement a new set of probabilities with which structure modifying operators are activated to encourage the design of architectures in which more than two tubes merge into a single tube. This new set of probabilities, implemented for condenser optimization, should differ from the set of probabilities used for the evaporators because multiple tubes merging into one tube is a much more favorable characteristic for condensers then evaporators due to the different volumetric flow reductions experienced.

Item (c)
Improve the robustness of ISHED for condenser optimization  while maintaining the current ISHED?s capabilities to optimize the evaporator. 


C.  Contractor Requirements

Education and Experience
-	The contractor shall have a Bachelor?s degree or higher in computer science and at least 3 years experience with programming in C++
-	The contractors shall have at least 3 years experience with Darwinian and symbolic learning-based methods used for optimization purposes. 

General requirements
-	The ISHED module should recognize the optimization case (evaporator or condenser) by reading the first line of the file ?EVAP.OPC? located in directory \ISHED\COILS\HX.  This line will consist of the number ?3? if the optimization run is for an evaporator or ?12? if it is for a condenser.
-	The implemented code modifications should not affect ISHED?s compatibility with the current beta version of the EVAP-COND/ISHED C++ interface.
-	The implemented code modifications should not deteriorate ISHED?s current capability to optimize refrigerant circuitries for evaporators.  Attachment A specifies the robustness criteria for evaporator optimization.

Objective specific requirements
Item (a)
The requirement is as stated in Section B, Item (a).

Item (b)
The requirement is as stated in Section B, Item (b).

Item (c) The Contractor is required to modify the existing  code of ISHED to satisfy to the robustness acceptance criteria specified in Attachment B. 

The period of performance is 4.5 months, beginning on the date of contract award.  The contractor shall present the deliverables to the COTR within 2 months from the date of contract award. The Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) shall provide the contractor with his feedback within one month from the date the COTR received the deliverables.  Then, the contactor will have one month to incorporate modifications to the deliverables based on the COTR feedback.  The COTR will have 0.5 month for final verification. 

Completion of the project includes:
-	Implementation of all stipulated code modifications to effect the stipulated functional upgrades
-	Delivery of the executable element for the program (electronic format)
-	Delivery of the source code of the program (electronic version) 
-	A written report documenting the changes made to the code and the resulting input/output requirements. 

The contractor is expected to consult with the COTR bi-weekly during the period of performance of this contract.  For planning purposes, each meeting should last less than one (1) hour.

Note: NIST will be the distribution source for ISHED; the contractor shall not distribute the program code received from the COTR or developed under this contract in any form.

D.  Government Responsibilities

The Government will provide the contractor with the source code to be upgraded of the current version of ISHED, with the latest executable versions of the EVAP and COND heat exchanger simulators from the EVAP-COND package, and with the executable element of the current beta version of the EVAP-COND/ISHED interface.

The COTR will be available to the contractor for consultation regarding design details of the EVAP-COND interface and its interaction with the simulation modules.

E.   Reporting Requirements and Deliverables

See the ?Contractor Requirements? section above.  

F.  Program Management and Control Requirements

No special requirements for this contract.

G.  Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

The COTR will evaluate the written report  and the performance of the machine learning components of the ISHED package through testing of the complete ISHED system as to their conformance to the contract requirements and will approve or disapprove them within four weeks after delivery of the deliverables.

2. Evaporator with five depth rows having 17 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;
3. Evaporator with four depth rows having 32 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;

For each heat exchanger, 5 optimization runs will be performed.  The number of generations will be 500.  All other ISHED.PAR parameters will be set to their default values, except where stated otherwise.

The performance will be considered satisfactory if:
-	at least four out of five optimization runs for each heat exchanger completes evaluations of  all 500 generations (i.e., 80 % completion rate is acceptable)
-	all optimization runs show increasing trend in capacities with the progression of the optmization run.

The following are detailed specifications for the heat exchagers and operating conditions that will be used to evaluate the robustness of the machine learning components of the ISHED package.  They are presented in the format compatable with the EVAP-COND package.

Acceptance Criteria of the ISHED Package for Condenser Optimization

The COTR will evaluate the robustness of the machine learning components of the ISHED package by executing optimization runs for a total of five heat exchagers of the following general specifications, more detail for each test case is located on the following pages of this attachment:  

1. Condenser with three depth rows having 43 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;
2. Condenser with five depth rows having 26 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;
3. Condenser with four depth rows having 32 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;
4. Condenser with four depth rows having 32 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;
5. Condenser with two depth rows having 50 tubes per depth row; population size = 20;

For each heat exchanger, 5 optimization runs will be performed.  The number of generations will be 500.  All other ISHED.PAR parameters will be set to their default values, except where stated otherwise.

The performance will be considered satisfactory if:
-	at least four out of five optimization runs for each heat exchanger completes evaluations of  all 500 generations (i.e., 80 % completion rate is acceptable)
-	all optimization runs show increasing trend in capacities with the progression of the optmization run.

The following are detailed specifications for the heat exchagers and operating conditions that will be used to evaluate the robustness of the machine learning components of the ISHED package.  They are presented in the format compatable with the EVAP-COND package.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment to BAA W911W6-08-R-0002 is to publish all questions and responses received and provided to date. Topic 01-2008: 1.  What Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is the Government expecting for the durability solution?  The Government is expecting an ending TRL of 6 for the durability solution regarding Topic 01-2008. Topic 02-2008: 1.  Are acoustic technologies of interest to the Government limited to on blade technologies or can they be aircraft configuration and/or operational technique technologies?  Acoustic technologies of interest to the Government are limited to on-blade techn ologies (main and/or tail), not aircraft configuration and/or operational technique technologies. 2.  Do vibration reductions refer to 1P (once per revolution), NP (multiple cycles per revolution) or both?  Topic 02-2008 vibration reductions refer to both 1P and NP. 3.  Does increasing blade maximum loading by at least 16% refer to the maneuver loads (i.e. not steady loads)?  The maximum blade loading increase by at least 16% refers to steady loads. The associated TDA and ASSP technology goal concerns sustained max  blade loading. 4.  The current US Army inventory, from which the offeror is to choose a baseline aircraft, is articulated rotor helicopters.  Is the Government also interested in technologies only applicable to compound and/or tiltrotor aircraft?  Does the Government see  benefits to technologies applicable to conventional and advance rotorcraft configurations?  The Government is not interested in technologies only applicable to compound and/or tiltrotor aircraft but does see benefits to technologies applicable to conventi onal and advance rotorcraft configurations. Topics 01-2008, 02-2008 and 03-2008: 1.  Could the Government authorize the proposals priced by fiscal year or by quarter instead of by month?  The Announcement requires a funding profile with a cost breakdown by month be included within the cost proposal.  This information is required to est imate fiscal year costs in the event the award date (which may not correspond to the start of a FY or quarter) is earlier or later than the proposed start date.   2.  Could the Government authorize the proposals priced by high level WBS?  The structure of the cost proposal as stated in the Announcement is required for various reasons and it is not our intent to modify the Announcement and change the requested format . 3.  If an offeror were to propose several technologies and the Government liked only one or two, could the Government choose only part of the proposal for negotiation and funding?  It is the Government's intent to award full proposalshowever, there is not hing that prohibits the Government from funding only part of a proposal.
