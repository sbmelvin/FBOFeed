<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a Lightning Electromagnetic Effects Modeling and Testing Project, Swept Stroke Lightning Attachment Study.  The objective of the study is to provide cost and feasability analyses of using either a wind tunnel or the NASA Langley Aircraft Landing Facility for swept stroke lightning attachment measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall deliver two probes capable of measuring surface currents on composite panels and aircraft-related geometries; and, deliver six composite panels, three of which have lightning protection and three of which do not.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Lightning Technologies, Inc. as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  Lightning Technologies, Inc. is the only known independent lightning test laboratory with previous experience in conducting swept stroke lightning attachment measurements.  Additionally, Lightning Technologies is the only known independent lightning test laboratory that currently specializes in research and development and laboratory services related to lightning strike effects on aerospace systems.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 5, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are  acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.
