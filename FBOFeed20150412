Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System.

A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>

Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings.

<p><br />(xv) Brand Justification:</p>
<p>Bromium vSentry software creates a specific environment isolated down to the hardware which mimics a singular system which prevents the malware from escaping. The software provides a micro virtualization (also referred to as a hardware isolation virtualization) capability which uses hardware level isolation to stop targeted attacks including zero day exploits, commonly considered undetectable, from successfully penetrating Department systems. The software utilizes micro-virtualization for the most common untrusted tasks and threat vectors, including browsing the internet, downloading documents, opening email attachments, and launching files from authorized USB/removable storage devices. This software is currently in use by the Department and a transition to another system could cause a loss or damage to data.</p>
