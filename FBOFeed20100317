<DESC>Air Armament Center, AAC/PKET, at Eglin AFB, FL intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed-price contract to GE Aviation, 1 Neumann Way, Cincinnati, OH 45215, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. The requirement is for developing modeling and test predictions of Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) missile damage on CF6-50 Engines in support of the 46th Test Group (46TG). <br />The principle tasks of this contract effort are to: consult with the 46TG concerning the CF6-50 engine as it relates to planning of the MANPADS testing, verifying that the two CF6-50 engines (owned by the 46TG and located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) are correctly configured for test operation, providing expertise for selection of a shotline, and generating LS-DYNA model predictions of MANPADS damage with and without warhead detonation.<br />Market research has determined that only GE possesses the proprietary knowledge of the CF6-50 engine's specific material types, material properties, and high-temperature failure properties necessary for credible damage predictions. GE also is the only organization that has an existing LS-DYNA model of the CF6-50 engine and is therefore able to offer credible information concerning model fidelity and the model's ability to support candidate locations for the shotline. In addition, the Government does not possess a technical data package of the CF6-50 engine or LS-DYNA engine&nbsp;model that it can provide to other offerors. The Government believes such data is necessary to perform this planned contract.<br />The performance period is anticipated to be about 10 months after contract award, but may need to be shortened because damage predictions are projected to be needed by mid-December 2010 and a detailed technical report due by mid-March 2011. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this effort is 541712; small business size standard is 500 employees.<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422. Collect calls will not be accepted.<br />

<DESC>This is a market survey for replacement of the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) on FAA Challenger aircraft 604-5588, N88.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aircraft Maintenance and EngineeringGroup (AMEG), has a requirement to replace the Honeywell (APU) model 36-100[E] on the subject aircraft with an improved and more reliable Honeywell APU model 36-150[CL].  For survey information purposes the aircraft will be made available for the APU replacement at a mutually agreed date within the months of June 2010 through September 2010 and is contemplated to be Firm Fixed Price with Time and Material/Labor hour elements for unscheduled Over and Above work required to return the aircraft to airworthy status.   The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1500 employees.  
Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In addition, interested firms must provide documentation that they meet certain technical qualifications identified in the attached Draft Statement of Work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by Friday, April 2nd, 2010, 5:00 PM CST.   All submittals should be submitted to:

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation intends to award a succeeding lease using other than full and open competition to the incumbent lessor Pin Oak Properties, LLC for approximately 48,372 contiguous rentable square feet (rsf) of office space and 106,800 rsf of warehouse space and minimum of 235 parking spaces in White Hall (formerly known as Fairmont), West Virginia. The lease term is for a firm four (4) years with one year option period. An extensive market research was conducted and found that there was no potential source available in the delineated area (North-Fairmont, WV, South-Quiet Dell, East-Harrison and Taylor County lines and West-Wilsonburg) that could provide the contiguous square footage of space needed. Therefore, the Government has made a determination to proceed on a sole source basis to remain at its current location. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that it would not be economically advantageous to relocate to another facility due to the substantial relocation costs (i.e., physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure, life and fire safety standards, security requirements and non-productive agency downtime) that would be incurred and not recovered through competition. Lastly, due to the fact that the Government intends to vacate this space and permanently relocate to a new constructed facility in approximately 2014, it would not be cost effective to the Government to relocate to another facility and incur duplicate relocation costs as listed above in order to become operational for a short period of time. This notice of intent is not a solicitation for offers. Should there be any inquiries, contact this office by 3:00 pm on March 29, 2010.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is only available to the contractor(s) who were awarded the contract(s) for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-04R3-S-09-8113, COLLABORATIVE RESTORATION STEWARDSHIP, ON THE UMATILLA, WALLOWA-WHITMAN, MALHEUR AND OCHOCO NATIONAL FOREST. The original solicitation was competitively advertised as a Commercial Items RFP. The Government intends to award multiple Delivery Orders from a single request for quotations.  This project will be partially or wholly funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto. 


The Collaborative Restoration Stewardship contract is an integrated resource contract that includes ground-based logging, cable logging, and product transportation as well as slash treatment.  The issuance of these Delivery Orders require the contractor(s) to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing or rearranging the existing fuel loading on the forest floor.  This particular project title is Sage Stew TO 2, which is located in the Silvies Project Area, on the Malheur National Forest.   All biomass removed will remain the property of the US Government and be transported by service contractor to local processors. This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees at an average spacing of 20 feet to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provide a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area. Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment. Target fuel loading objective is to have no more than 5 to 10 tons per acre left once the work is completed. Slash treatment where required will be accomplished using mechanized equipment to masticate (chip) the slash. 


This project requires removal of approximately 2,320 tons of non-saw material (merchantable woody biomass). 


The resultant Task Order contract(s) will be a firm-fixed price, with requirements for biomass removal. 


If you have questions about this project please contact Gary Dillavou Contract Specialist at (541) 278-3841.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the U.S. Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-024B-S-10-0008 on or about March 25, 2010 for a large fire cost review. If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective contractors should the FedBizOpps website on or about 25 March to obtain a copy of the solicitation. All future information about this acquisition will be distributed solely through this website.


Project Description: The contractor will be responsible for bringing together a diverse team with expertise in the areas of wildland fire management, land management, risk management, and wildfire suppression strategies.  The contractor will recruit skilled personnel from other land management and response agencies, and possibly other countries, to review the agencys response to wildfires.  This might include specialists from the military, academia, industry, and emergency agencies for expertise in land management, wildland fire management, risk management, and large field operations involving ground and air assets and catastrophic threats to the public. 

The contractor will coordinate and oversee the work of the Independent Panel. The panel is tasked with examining and reporting on fire suppression costs for wildfire incidents during Fiscal Year 2009 where federal expenditures exceeded $10,000,000.  The panels purpose will be to determine if the agency exercised fiscal diligence in managing specific incident suppression activities.  This panel is not expected to complete an exhaustive fiscal audit of all incident phases.  Rather, the focus will be on evaluating how these large fires were managed.   The Review objectives for this years panel should focus, as possible, on the following areas:

Evaluating the risk-based management of these large fires from a systems standpoint  from planning and decision-making through implementation and the outcomes that resulted.  For each of these stages, people, skills, and technology should be assessed and what in the system worked well and what in the system needs to be improved should be identified.

Assessing the utilization of new processes, guidance, expectations and tools that have changed the business of fire management in recent years in an effort to determine the impact these changes have had and develop a baseline for comparison in future years as these efforts mature.

Determining whether the agencys current review process is yielding positive changes and identifying ways to improve the agencys current fire review processes.

If the panel finds instances where the agency may not have executed prudent fiscal decisions with respect to public/firefighter safety, natural resource, and private property protection, estimate the proportions of appropriate and excess suppression costs (recognizing that excess costs would be earmarked for return to the treasury based on end of fiscal year 2009 balances). 

Summarize findings in a report to the Secretary of Agriculture.


Participation: This project is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acqusition is 541620. The small business size standard is $7.0 million average income over the last three years.

<DESC>This synopsis is being provided for information purposes only.  NASA Goddard hasselected Fibertek Inc for the Laser Systems Engineering Services (LSES) contract,NNG09CP09C.  This is an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Cost-Plus Award Feecontract valued at $35 million. The period of performance is five years. The NAICS Codeis 336419 and the Size Standard is 1,000 employees.  The estimated value of the proposed task order #10 is $1,739,000. The anticipated periodof performance is 1 April 2010 to 31 Oct 2010.	NASA Goddard intends to award Task Order #10 to contract NNG09CP09C, IAW the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, PL 111-5. Task order #10 is the Ice, Cloud andLand Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) Project is baselining a multiple ground-spot,micropulse laser measurement approach for ranging to collect data on the topography ofice sheets and the thickness characteristics of sea ice. The Advanced Topographic LaserAltimeter System (ATLAS) instrument is designed to operate in micropulse (photoncounting) mode. This micropulse laser will put multiple low energy, high repetitionpulses in the air at one time. As such, the Project requires a Detector with highsensitivity, low noise, high speed, and low time jitter to capture the returning photonsfrom the ground return. In addition, the Detector or combination of detectors (array)must survive for a minimum of 5 years in a large solar background radiation environment.This task involves designing, building, demonstrating and delivering a complete detectorsystem. In this context, the detector system is essentially a non-flight packageddetector with back-end electronics; an intermediate design detector with breadboardelectronics (that may include off-the-shelf parts) and a fully tested, customizeddetector prototype that has undergone Technology Readiness Level (TRL6) testing. Thetarget performance goals for this task are listed below and correspond to the performanceparameters listed in ATLAS Detector Performance Technical Note (ICESat-2-ATSYS-SPEC-TBD)found in the ICESat-2 Management Information System (MIS), configuration management. Mostof the work is expected to be performed at the contractors facility.This document and any other related documents to this procurement will be available overthe Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may beaccessed using a WWW browser application.

<CONTACT>Andrew S Klimas, Phone 410-965-9473, Fax 410-966-0870, Email andrew.klimas@ssa.gov
<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to solicit a proposal from, and issue a contract to, Pitney Bowes Inc., of Baltimore, MD, for the purchase and onsite preventive and remedial maintenance of Pitney Bowes mail processing equipment and related hardware and software, including Pitney Bowes' proprietary Track and Trace software system enhancements, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>for a base year and four option years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Four of the five mail processing systems purchased under the contract will replace currently-installed Pitney Bowes mail processing systems at SSA's National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An additional Pitney Bowes mail processing system will be installed at SSA's Durham Support Center in Durham, NC as backup to the NCC mail operation.</p>
<p>The contract will procure and install Pitney Bowes MPS and FPS devices at SSA's NCC to replace existing Pitney Bowes mail inserter finishing equipment used by SSA to mail Social Security Number (SSN) cards and SSA notices to the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current and replacement Pitney Bowes mailing systems include Pitney Bowes' proprietary Track &amp; Trace System, composed of hardware and software components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two Pitney Bowes MPS inserters will replace the two currently-installed Pitney Bowes NCC Flowmaster inserters that SSA uses to provide SSN cards to the public, and two Pitney Bowes FPS inserters will replace SSA's two Pitney Bowes NCC Series 8 inserters that SSA uses to issue notices to the public. An additional MPS inserter will be installed at SSA's Durham Support Center in Durham, NC. and will serve as a backup and supplemental facility for SSA's NCC facility.</p>
<p>The Pitney Bowes MPS inserters will cut individual SSN cards from a 2,000 card bundle, obtain the security information for the Track &amp; Trace System, insert the cards into envelopes, apply postage and prepare sealed envelopes for pickup by SSA's presort contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The MPS systems will be functionally identical to SSA's existing upgraded Pitney Bowes Flowmasters (with only minor differences attributable to engineering changes made by Pitney Bowes) and will include Pitney Bowes proprietary Track and Trace hardware and software features for providing security measures necessary for controlling and accounting for new and replacement SSN cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Pitney Bowes FPS devices will cut individual SSA notices from printed roll stock, obtain the security information for the Track &amp; Trace System, insert the notices into envelopes, apply postage and prepare sealed envelopes for pickup by SSA's presort contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FPS inserters to be acquired will be functionally identical to SSA's existing upgraded Pitney Bowes Series 8 inserters (with only minor differences attributable to engineering changes made by Pitney Bowes) and will include Pitney Bowes proprietary Track and Trace hardware and software features for providing security measures necessary for controlling and accounting for SSA notices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Pitney Bowes inserters will be tightly integrated with SSA's current Pitney Bowes Track and Trace System that Pitney Bowes has installed on SSA's current NCC Pitney Bowes systems and customized for SSA's use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA implemented the Pitney Bowes Track &amp; Trace System to track and secure the public's sensitive personal information contained in SSA's daily mailings as well as SSA's issuance of new and replacement SSN cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Salient characteristics of the proprietary Track and Trace system include: 1) "Real-Time" communication and "Real-Time" reconciliation with SSA electronic records. This is important because SSA needs to be able to capture and avoid issuance of duplicate SSN cards in "real time."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA must account for and provide the status of each SSN card immediately and not in a batch mode. 2) Physical integrity validation on the inserter. The Track and Trace System also includes a Pitney Bowes proprietary "Thickness Detection Kit" integrated into the inserter systems that can detect in "real time" the presence of multiple or duplicate SSN cards within a single envelope and prevent the issuance of multiple or duplicate cards.</p>
<p>Pitney Bowes will also provide maintenance under the contract for the equipment and software described above. The contractor will provide coverage from 12:00AM through 4PM Monday through Friday to service the Pitney Bowes equipment located in SSA's NCC in Baltimore, MD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will provide onsite customer support engineers for the maintenance period described above (12:00AM through 4PM Monday through Friday) as well as on-call services outside the Principle Period of Maintenance (PPM) which includes weekends and holidays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will provide similar coverage at SSA's Durham Support Center. The contractor will provide only Pitney Bowes-certified technicians to maintain the equipment during the service period. The contractor will perform regular preventive maintenance on the equipment in accordance with Pitney Bowes operating guidelines.</p>
<p>Other organizations that believe they are capable of meeting SSA's NCC Pitney Bowes equipment and software, and maintenance requirements are invited to submit information establishing a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. If the SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing this requirement, the agency will solicit a quotation and issue a sole source award for the supplying of inserter equipment and associated software, and on-site preventive and remedial NCC and Durham Pitney Bowes maintenance to Pitney Bowes under FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation, and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the information received. Responses to this notice must be submitted by October 16, 2009, 3:00 PM EST. Responses may be sent via e-mail only to the point of contact listed below.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The contractor shall establish and operate in the contractor's name the noncommercial food service facilities for the purpose of dispensing food, nonalcoholic beverages, catering services, and other items as may be authorized by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with all terms and conditions specified. This cafeteria is to be operated for the benefit of approximately 1,000 employees who will be occupants in the building and persons visiting the building each day. 

The contractor should aim to:
	Deliver food and beverages at attractive price options that are healthy, organic and grown locally; and
	Maintain operations in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.

This is the first request for proposal by GSA that seeks to introduce measurable wellness and sustainability objectives into a concessions contract.  This will be a contract with significant opportunity for the successful offeror to gain national media exposure.

The specific beginning date is to be designated by the Contracting Officer, but shall be on or about August 1, 2010.  The contract shall be for a period of 5 years effective with the beginning date specified in the Notice to Proceed.  At the option of the Contracting Officer, it may be extended thereafter for two (2) additional 5 year option terms. In no event shall the contract period as extended, exceed a period of 15 years from the beginning date of the original contract. 

All contractor employees are required to be cleared through the Department of Homeland Security HSPD-12 Security Clearance Process. No contractors will be allowed to work within the above Federal Buildings without gaining a HSPD-12 Security Clearance.
  
The solicitation and any announcements concerning these services shall be issued via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO.GOV). The Government shall not furnish any paper copies to vendors requesting copies. The solicitation shall be issued on or about March 30, 2010 with proposals due on or about April 30, 2010. 

The Contracting Officers plans to solicit this requirement without exclusions of sources. However, GSA strongly encourages participation by small businesses and the related socioeconomic categories of small disadvantaged, women owned, service disabled veteran owned, HUB Zone, 8(A) and veteran owned businesses.

Employ Integrated Design Principles (Integrated Design, Commissioning), 2. Optimize Energy Performance (Energy Efficiency, Measurement and Verification), 3. Protect and Conserve Water (Indoor Water, Outdoor Water), 4. Enhance Indoor Environmental Quality (Ventilation, Thermal Comfort, Moisture Control, Daylighting, Low-Emitting Materials, Protect IAQ during Construction), 5. Reduce Environmental Impact of Materials (Recycled Content, Biobased Content, Construction Waste, Ozone Depleting Compounds).   Sustainable design features, activities and equivalencies are part of overall Federal policy to limit environmental impact and ensure the environmental compatibility of Federal facilities. It is the intent of the VA to make every reasonable and rational effort to meet these requirements. In the event the A/E concludes that implementation of specific sustainability requirements is not feasible (in that doing so creates major negative impacts on the project, including major overall cost increases, major operational feasibility issues, major technology application issues, etc.), a detailed rationale for limiting the use of the specific sustainability feature in question shall be submitted in writing to the Project Engineer for consideration. Such rationale shall include discussion of the significant negative impacts to the project. Cost comparisons and evaluations used in supporting the non-inclusion of required sustainability features must show an overwhelming life cycle rationale. Such exclusions shall not be implemented unless specifically approved by the Project Engineer.AE shall also incorporate into the design construction bid alternates identified during the design process.  Also identify in the design any phasing required to facilitate construction.  Additionally, the A/E firm shall have the plans and specifications reviewed and certified by a registered Fire Protection Engineer as being in compliance with the current Life Safety Code (LSC) and applicable National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes.  The final cost estimate shall utilize pricing and format established by RS Means CostWorks "Facility Construction Data", most current edition.  Also provide a detailed submittal register for the final design.The solicitation is to be issued as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Small Business Set-Aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541310.  This Small Business Size Standard is $4.5 Million dollars average annual gross revenues for the past three fiscal years.  This information is only used for classification purposes in the representation and certification portion of the Request for Proposal (RFP).To be considered for award, A/E must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and VetBiz databases.  A/E firms can obtain CCR information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  VetBiz information for registration and confirmation in website can be found at http://www.vip/vetbiz.gov. A/E is also required to submit Annual Representations and Certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov.  To register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in your CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.

This should consist of a single award service contract that can perform natural and cultural resource surveys, assessments, evaluation, monitoring, and other related studies/projects ( to include but not necessarily limited to GIS related efforts, TES habitat construction and shrub clearance) the execution of which supports EUCOM environmental missions.  To accomplish this, a Service Contract IDC for Natural and Cultural Resource Management and related GIS conservation compliance work should be in place at all times. The resulting contract is needed because of the large number of surveys, assessments and reports required to comply with host nation and US laws.  The primary location of services required has been and will continue to be Germany since a majority of EUCOM installations are located in this country.  It will also be used to a lesser extent in Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.  However the resulting contract should be broad enough to allow natural and cultural resource assessments and other GIS studies at all EUCOM installations.  It is not limited to these areas or to the U.S. Army and may be used wherever the U.S. military is involved in supporting actions in the EUCOM area of responsibility or where the US Army Corps of Engineers is requested to provide support.<BR><BR>The project will be advertised as an RFP for a single IDC using firm-fixed price task orders which will identify the scope of work, and location. The maximum overall cumulative value of this contract will be $20M over the 5-year term of the contract.  The contract will consist of one (1) base year period and four (4) one-year options, for a total performance period of five (5) years.

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Amir Dajani, Deputy Managing Director<br />Massar Associates<br />7 Al-Kawther Street<br />Al-Bireh, Palestine<br />Tel: 00970 2 2409595<br />Email: Adajani@Rawabi.Ps</p>
<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform a Feasibility Study for the Rawabi Tertiary Treatment Facility and Wastewater Reuse Project.</p>
<p>The vision of the Rawabi development is to create an affordable and environmentally sustainable residential community in the West Bank that will simultaneously act as a hub for a knowledge-based economy. The Rawabi community is being developed on a 250-acre site in the West Bank, six miles north of Ramallah. The community is envisaged to eventually grow to accommodate 40,000 residents, plus a commercial center, schools, a clinic and a hotel. The projected initial occupancy date is 2011.</p>
<p>The Rawabi development is designed to promote sustainable economic growth and affordable housing in the West Bank while advancing the use of environmentally beneficial technologies for wastewater reuse in this water scarce region. Affordable housing is in very short supply in the West Bank. The lack of housing is a significant barrier to improved living standards and upward mobility, and this development will help to address the lack of housing. The Rawabi development is also expected to constitute the largest job-creation initiative in the history of the Palestinian Territories, both in terms of short- to medium-term employment during the construction phase, and in terms of permanent job opportunities resulting from the community's commercial and business activities. Given that Rawabi is intended to serve as a magnet for high-technology businesses, many of these opportunities are expected to be of particular benefit to the West Bank's well-educated but underemployed young workforce.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present Feasibility Study (FS) is to assess wastewater treatment technologies for wastewater reclamation and reuse both within the Rawabi community and for irrigation of agricultural land and industrial sites outside of the Rawabi area. The FS will investigate the suitability of current wastewater treatment technology such as Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) and Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) for wastewater treatment for reuse in accordance with current water quality standards for treated wastewater irrigation. The evaluation will assess the advantages and disadvantages of using these technologies to carry out wastewater reclamation systems for agriculture wastewater reuse in the study area. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$273,772 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or the West Bank. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the West Bank for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM Local Time, April 19, 2010 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>The Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR), 1515 College Ave., Manhattan, KS 66502, conducts innovative research and develops new technologies to solve problems related to flour production; CGAHR is in need of a new Milling Machine. One of the CGAHR requirements for a Mill is that bushels of wheat can be continuously milled. The experimental milling system must be capable of performing the U.S. Hard Winter Wheat Crop Survey. Should be capable of producing at least six (6) flour products, this provides considerably more information how the wheat sample might perform on a large-scale commercial mill, which is a critical requirement of the crop survey. Consistency in data methods is of paramount importance.
<p>This is a sources sought. A requirement does not currently exist. Funds are not currently available to procure this Grain Mill. Manufacturers are invited to submit their product information for review prior to a possible future requirement.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br />Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Training Simulator/Device<br />to support<br />Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPA) Instrument Qualification (RIQ)
<p>1. Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for a training simulator.</p>
<p>What's needed:<br />A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "approved " commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IFR Flight Simulator that will be used to supplement training in Undergraduate RPA Pilot IFR training. We are seeking a low cost solution. The simulator is to be either a Single-Engine Land or Multi-Engine Land (limited to center-line Thrust) configuration with either a Horizontal Visual display (wall, screen, etc) or partial wrap around Visual display. The Visual Display must be realistic of the aviation environment. The physical construction of the simulator should be robust enough to simulate the cockpit environment but a low cost solution is desired. Cockpit controls should be representative of actual aircraft controls and function in a representative manner. This simulator will be used for basic/transition/VFR training prior to its use as an IFR trainer and those phases of flight must be supported. Seamless training from basic switchology to IFR training is required. Flat screen displays/Multi-functional displays (MFDs)/Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) that are swappable instead of round dial aircraft instruments are required for HSI, ADI, engine display, etc. The computer driven displays should be easily swapped out in the event of display failure. The simulator displays (Instrumentation and Visual display) should be driven by COTS computer software and hardware. A "Soft or less than 100% replication" of the cockpit/instrument environment is acceptable as our desire is to have low MX costs (Traditional Aircraft Gauges that require calibration is not intended). The Navigation Area/Database should include the United States with accurate terrain/obstruction elevation data. Visual Terrain Scenery should be generally representative in the US and 100% accuracy for NAVAID/Instrument Approach Plate (IAP)/US Airspace structure is required. Approach capability (Navigation Database, Aircraft display (avionics), and communication) should include VOR, DME, ILS, LOC, ASR/PAR, and GPS (RNAV). Flight scenarios should be able to be saved by the instructor and then recalled for subsequent student use. The ability to pause the student training in flight is a requirement. Weather conditions must support both VFR and IFR environments and include clouds/ cloud layers, rain, variable winds, and fog. Both day and night operations are required. Different Turbulence factors are required. An instructor Control Station detached from the Simulator is required in order to input changes to the scenario without student knowledge and to allow the student to experience "solo flight" without the instructor present in the cockpit. The instructor Control Station should replicate actual student performance with 100% accuracy but does not need to be representative of aircraft layout, IE, LCD display of aircraft gauges and performance is acceptable. The instructor Control Station should serve the Air Traffic Control (ATC) function. The Audio environment should be realistic to the aviation environment, IE thunder, aircraft noise, ATC radio calls to the pilot headset. The simulator should support 12 hours of continuous use in a normal training environment. US Power compliance is required (110V or 240v).</p>
<p>Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) at site (to be determined) required.</p>
<p>Syllabus supported:<br />U-P3A-A, Undergraduate Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Instrument Qualification (UIQ)</p>
<p>Desired Traits: <br />Wrap around displays that extend resolution (past 90 degree horizontal/vertical) to 200-240 degrees could be preferred. A wide field-of-view could enhance student training. Overhead display capability, IE extension of the visual to a limited vertical/overhead view could supplement student training. Motion for the simulator is not required, but might provide some training advantage. The Navigation Area/Database could include ICAO destinations to enhance student training. The ability to print (a hardcopy) the student's performance on an IAP is desired. Replication of US Military Fields/IAPs is not required but would be highly desirable and the ability of the vendor to produce/obtain those on an on-going basis as new requirements dictate would be important. Dual cockpit controls are not required but could supplement student training. A stick control instead of yoke control is desired. Aerodynamic feel (loading) of cockpit controls should be representative of actual aircraft performance but is not required. A second seat in the simulator with a dual-control set-up for instructor demonstrations is desirable but not required. Ideally, some ATC functions from the Instructor Control station would include "false radio calls" selectable by the instructor (automated routine, pre-programmed by event, etc) to enhance student learning. Visual Display Technology (rear or forward projection system, etc) is up to the Vendor. Pre-constructed Flight Profiles and Vendor training of our instructor force are desired. A Manufacture/Vendor Warranty guarantee for hardware, displays, physical simulator is desired. Light Emitting Diode (LED) Displays may be substituted for MFD/LEDs if desired by the Vendor. NDB approach capability could enhance student training. The ability to transport the simulators at a reasonable cost (IE a nominal tear-down effort without significant re-assembly or set-up costs), in the event of base closure or a change in mission needs is desirable. We do not foresee more than 1 or 2 moves over the lifespan of the Simulator.</p>
<p><br />Timing Information:<br />The USAF is currently planning for installation and use in summer 2011. We require at least one simulator by 15 Jan 2011 to train instructors and develop courseware with a second device by 15 Mar 2011. For planning only: deliver two additional simulators per quarter (delivery dates 1 Jul 2011, 1 Oct 2011, 1 Jan 2012 and 1 Apr 2012.)</p>
<p>Respondents please answer the following questions regarding the requirements and/or strategy:<br />1. Are IFR Flight Simulators available commercially to meet this need, and are they certified?<br />2. Is the stated schedule realistic?<br />3. Are there any requirements listed that are not incorporated by a commercially available solution?<br />4. Is there are published price lists?</p>
<p>2. The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.

<p>Following is a statement of work which may be revised in the future based on information received in response to this notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested vendors are asked to include any suggestions based on the requirements of the Government and provide a quote based on information in this Sources Sought notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This information shall accompany your response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The NAICS Code for this requirement is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">541511 - Website Design &amp; Development</strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Requirement</span> </strong></p>
<p>UNICOR, (Federal Prison Industries) seeks to identify and solicit feedback from capable sources to design, develop, and implement a new e-commerce/transactional website for our organization that will increase usability and customer satisfaction; increase sales, site traffic, and marketing leads; and present a targeted, clear, and consistent message to the end-user. UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries aims to maximize the Return on Investment (ROI) by transitioning offline sales activities to the website. UNICOR requires a user-friendly website that allows prospective customers and information seekers to readily identify who UNICOR is and the broad array of products and services offered. The website must provide streamlined paths for prospective customers in the decision-making process. Primary messaging must communicate solutions and services, provide information that fits users' needs, and more importantly, drive leads and sales of products and services through both online and offline channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Goals/Objectives of the Requirement</span></strong></p>
<p>The goal of UNICOR's website is to provide a simple/easy electronic vehicle for doing business with UNICOR &amp; serve as a public communications avenue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current site structure and design was developed years ago and requires a significant redesign to take advantage of new design elements and growing demand for e-government transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>UNICOR needs to redesign/enhance its e-commerce/transactional website to be resourceful, informative, and serve as a marketing asset that provides a customer/business-friendly environment that highlights UNICOR's products / services and inmate programs. The redesigned e-commerce/transactional website must support secure online credit card transactions, orders status and shipment tracking, online request forms, and a variety of other activities similar to comparable commercial sites that offer diverse products for retail sale ( i.e. Amazon.com).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The website must provide easy access to e-government services, be adaptable to current and changing technology, and provide content management capability for non-technical UNICOR staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Requirement Details</span></strong></p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0pt" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; ">Develop a highly beneficial, cost-effective, easy to use, interactive, and architecturally sound e-commerce/transactional website that is flexible enough to support future technologies and UNICOR's web initiatives for a minimum of five - seven years. The website should include a robust search engine for e-commerce activities. Examples include but not are limited to: product comparisons, search by product attributes, multiple shipping options, saving and sharing carts as done on Amazon.com. </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; ">Create a consistent and standardized format and enhanced graphical look for all pages, thereby establishing a unified theme throughout UNICOR's website. However, the established theme should provide the flexibility to allow different factions a level of individuality and/or functionality within UNICOR's diverse operations segments. UNICOR will provide initial designs that have been user tested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each section of the site must have a common look/theme.

UNICOR's website model calls for authorized staff to have some ability to perform routine content management related to routine information such as updating product specifications, adding/removing products from ecommerce store, posting meeting minutes, removing old and outdated information, and general noticing. The Web Program Manager(s) should have more comprehensive ability to provide quality control and the ability to update non-routine information. The system needs to be structured for maintenance and updating capabilities by non-technical staff. Contractor should list the software that would be used to create the site including all graphics software, and recommend software and licenses that UNICOR will need to purchase for the continued maintenance of the website. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Note: All vulnerabilities found in any software used to develop the new website must be fixed at the Contractor's expense.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This requirement is for the design, setup &amp; implementation of the new e-commerce/transaction website, but not intended for maintenance and support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The intent is that the design will be performed so that ongoing maintenance, updating &amp; support of the website will be accomplished in house by UNICOR web &amp; IT personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>UNICOR is interested in a content management process and is open to ideas on how best to accomplish this aspect of the new website.</li>

<DESC>The NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is performing a technical assessment toform the basis of a possible proposal for the NASA Science Mission Directorate DiscoveryProgram opportunity. This assessment is focused on conducting scientific exploration ofthe planet Mars using ARES, a robotic aerial platform (ARES: Aerial Regional-scaleEnvironmental Surveyor).The purpose of this announcement is to enable LaRC to obtain potential providers toparticipate in the development of the technical concept, proposal, and mission elementimplementation of the planetary entry and descent mission areas in response to theupcoming NASA Discovery Program Announcement of Opportunity (AO). Specific mission areaswhere LaRC is seeking assistance are for the planetary entry area with an integratedthermal protection system and for the descent area via a supersonic parachute.Discovery Program investigations address NASAs planetary science goals as described inSolar System Exploration, NASAs 2006 roadmap for planetary science. The roadmap may befound at http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/. While Discoveryinvestigations may focus on any body in the Solar System, excluding the Earth and theSun, and including Mars and the Moon, the ARES synopsis focuses on the exploration ofMars.Discovery investigations will be led by a Principal Investigator and will be comprised ofscientists in partnerships, potentially involving NASA Centers, academia, and industry.These teams will pursue missions of high scientific value utilizing observation platformsof their choice and design.Release of a draft Discovery AO is expected by the middle of CY 2010. It is anticipatedthat approximately two to three Discovery investigations will be selected for 9-monthPhase A concept studies. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned thatone Discovery investigation will be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequentmission phases. A launch date of 2016 is planned. Key attributes of the baseline concept for the planetary entry and descent areas arenoted below. These attributes are provided as a guide, however, the final system designsubmitted for the Discovery proposal will be developed between the selected Offeror(s)and LaRC. All responses provided should have demonstrated space heritage. While each ofthe subsystems may be comprised of multiple elements, it is the intention of theGovernment to solicit entities to provide complete subsystems for eventual integrationinto the mission in lieu of procuring specific components via this announcement. Key attributes of the planetary entry system area include the use of a rigid bi-coniccomposite aeroshell with a major diameter of 3 meters, and a 70-degree sphere coneforebody. The aeroshell will also include a thermal protection system to accommodate thehigh heat of entry. Key attributes of the descent area include use of a mortar deployed supersonicdisk-gap-band parachute which provides additional deceleration in the supersonic regime. Offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC. If selected through thissynopsis, each provider is expected to participate in the technical assessment, proposaldevelopment, and on the mission implementation team. LaRC will require each selectedprovider to submit a detailed letter of commitment outlining their contribution, whichwill be included in the proposal.LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the Offerors provided the ARESmission concept is selected for implementation. Interested parties may propose as aprovider for any, all, or any combination of the areas sought. Provider selections willbe made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the following order of importance:(1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the Offerorsrelevant technical experience and past performance in similar development activities.Provide a description of relevant technical experience including a summary of significantachievements and technical performance. The Offeror shall specifically discuss therelevance of their experience in reference to the design and development of compositestructures, thermal protection systems, and supersonic parachutes.

<DESC>This is a Source Sought Synopsis only. The purpose of this synopsis is to obtain capabilities information from all size and types of firms to determine the degree of competition. Information received will be used to make a determination regarding the use of full and open competition or to set aside the procurement. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. <br /><br />The anticipated contract will be a contract for the supply of a ship and crew. The resultant contract will be firm fixed-price, with reimbursable line items for fuel and related port charges. A paraphrased version of the requirement follows.
<p>NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Fisheries Science Center is planning a research survey in the Southern CA Bight for highly migratory species including pelagic sharks, albacore, and swordfish during the summer, 2010.</p>
<p>The overall goals of the survey are: 1) to conduct a fishery-independent longline survey for juvenile mako and blue sharks continuing a 14 year abundance time series; 2) to conduct trolling for albacore for the deployment of archival tags and to collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of North Pacific albacore entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; 3) to conduct longline fishing for swordfish to deploy archival tags and collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of swordfish entering the U.S. West Coast fisheries; and 4) to collect oceanographic data to examine environmental effects on the distribution and catch rates of sharks, albacore, and swordfish. The survey is being conducted to support research and data needs identified by NMFS and affiliated scientific organizations and committees including the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), the International Scientific Committee for Tunas and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific (ISC), and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). Conducting albacore and swordfish sampling will also help address some of the objectives of the SLUTH Initiative and the SWFSC/Albacore Industry Cooperative Research program and provide a better examination of the large pelagic fish component of the Southern CA Bight (SCB) ecosystem.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFOMANCE AND SAMPLING AREAS (See figures 1 and 2): Duration: Twenty (24) days minimum; if funding is available, charter will be extended to thirty (30) days. All offerors must be available for the full thirty (30) days. The research cruise is to be conducted continuously beginning during the months of June through August. Ideally, the charter would be conducted between June 15 - July 31. Schedule will be finalized at time of award.

<p><br />Background</p>
<p>In SECY-06-0200, "Results of the Review of Emergency Preparedness Regulations and <br />Guidance," dated September 20, 2006, the NRC staff proposed to begin activities to develop a voluntary performance-based regulatory concept. In the staff requirements memorandum (SRM) to SECY-06-0200, dated January 8, 2007, the Commission approved the request by the staff to begin exploratory activities in this area with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), conducting one or more public meeting(s), and providing a recommendation to the Commission on a path forward.</p>
<p>The staff developed a conceptual description of a performance-based emergency preparedness (PBEP) regulatory regimen for the onsite portions of nuclear plant programs. The staff presented the conceptual description to internal stakeholders and FEMA. The proposed regimen was revised based on feedback and then presented at a public meeting conducted on March 5, 2008. The staff discussed aspects of the proposed regulatory regimen including program goals, design considerations, performance demonstrations, performance indicators, and oversight activities. Comments from the State stakeholders were supportive of the regimen and industry personnel asked several insightful questions (ADAMS Accession Number ML080940393 for a meeting summary).</p>
<p>During the meeting, the staff identified additional developmental areas considered necessary before the regimen could be pursued in rulemaking. These areas include consensus performance standards, performance indicators, oversight process, and program implementation guidance. The staff conveyed to stakeholders that they would have a role in these developmental activities.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2008, the Nuclear Energy Institute Director of Emergency Preparedness provided the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) a letter (ADAMS Accession Number ML081340523) stating that industry would not be supportive of development or implementation of the PBEP regimen in the near future because of competing priorities. However, the letter noted that after the current EP rulemaking is completed, the nuclear industry could give stronger consideration to developing the regimen.</p>
<p>In the September 11, 2008, SRM COMDEK-08-0005 "FY2010 NRC Performance Budget Proposal," the Commission provided direction to support the development of a performance based approach to emergency preparedness. The SRM directed the staff to work with local communities and DHS to begin the next major EP enhancement of working to quantify the protection that EP plans and procedures should result in and codify them in regulations that are transparent, objective, and measurable.</p>
<p>In a memo dated November 24, 2008, (ADAMS Accession Number ML082100042) the staff stated "Given this direction and funding, the staff intends to begin activities in this area in FY2010, by first focusing on the development of overarching goals for a proposed performance-based EP program to include consideration of offsite EP programs. The conceptual regulatory regimen will then be discussed with FEMA for alignment.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Programs Office has a requirement for high resolution orthoimagery data in east Minnesota, including the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area.  The total coverage for this project is approximately 7,150 square miles.  USGS has the opportunity to obtain all this orthoimagery from the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office at 34% of the cost of the entire project because other agencies and local governments are contributing to this project.  The orthoimagery data will be collected and processed to meet the requirements of the USGS and NGA Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP).  The data coverage will include, but is not limited to, the following Minnesota counties: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Goodhue, Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright.  The data shall be delivered in one copy on mutually agreeable media.  The data delivery date is no later than December 31, 2010.  All deliverable data and documentation shall be free from restrictions regarding use and distribution.
Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1(2), the government considers the item specified as a sole source from the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office, 658 Cedar St 3rd Floor, Saint Paul, MN  55155-1603 and proposes to negotiate with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and provide considerable cost sharing are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-response to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business March 26, 2010 by 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of vendors for a production and acquisition entitled BETSS-C Cerberus Surveillance System.  Request only vendors respond that would be capable as a prime contractor.  The type of solicitation (to include the requirements included under the solicitation) that will be issued will depend upon the responses to this RFI and other information available to the Government.  The resultant acquisition approach must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors.  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations.  The Government requires capability to rapidly produce Cerberus systems for expedited delivery and fielding with a validated minimum requirement.<BR>This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract (see FAR 15.201(e). This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  The Government does not intend to reimburse respondents for information solicited.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.<BR>BACKGROUND: <BR>Cerberus provides the U.S. warfighter the flexibility to adjust to a variety of terrains, threats, and missions.  The current Cerberus baseline configuration consists of the following:<BR>a.Trailer-mounted tower with multiple detection and assessment systems and a monitoring station, self-contained on a single mobile platform. <BR>b.Laptop for the Command Post (CP) allows wireless remote monitoring and control of the tower; the tower can also be hardwired to the CP for more reliable communications.  <BR>c.Day camera, and a thermal camera mounted on a Pan/Tilt platform are used for assessment.  Cameras mounted on the radar head and Laser Range Finder provides supplemental visual data. <BR>d.Optional networked unattended ground sensors can be included to provide further flexibility.  <BR><BR>A Cerberus tower provides detection for vehicle movement and for personnel (range can vary based on terrain, clutter and target size).  Cerberus is integrated onto a HMMWV-towable trailer and sling-load-certified.  Each self-contained system runs on batteries which are recharged by an on-board 3 KW diesel generator, or commercial line power.   Cerberus uses a long range thermal camera to provide enhanced long-range performance and night detection.  The system also integrates a day camera, a laser range finder (LRF) and Global Positioning System (GPS) for deriving the grid coordinates of a target and an IR Pointer for illuminating targets for a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).<BR><BR>Cerberus may be operated remotely.  Multiple towers can be netted for control and annunciation to a Common Operating Picture (COP).  Networking multiple towers allows an operator to observe the entire perimeter through an easily understood display.  The alarm and assessment data are presented automatically on the display through data overlays and pop-up windows.  Typical setup time for all systems is under 30 minutes (using two personnel).  <BR><BR>OBJECTIVE:  Currently, the Cerberus Surveillance System has been developed, produced and fielded in support of ongoing combat operations. The intent of the RFI is to identify sources capable of rapidly producing additional units to address increasing requirements.  Upon award of any resulting contract, the contractor must thoroughly demonstrate capability to produce and support fielding of additional units to provide an urgent and quick response capability to the U.S. warfighter. <BR><BR> <BR>For purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to understand the capability and capacity of all interested firms.  If the Government were to set this acquisition aside for small business (either as a 100% set-aside or a partial set-aside), responsive small business concerns will be required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  In general, rules concerning affiliation and joint ventures are located at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for services, at least 50% of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime.  The prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 212.103(h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3). Note that there is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors.<BR><BR>Contemplated contract type:  Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Task Order Arrangement <BR><BR>Anticipated period of performance:  A five-year ordering period with an anticipated award date: 12-18 months after issuance of RFI.<BR><BR>Contract Ceiling: TBD<BR><BR>Contemplated NAICS Code:  334511 with a size standard of 750 employees.<BR><BR>Foreign participation will not be allowed at the prime contractor or subcontract level.<BR><BR>RESPONSES: Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages and should be Office 2007 compatible.   Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font. Line spacing shall be set at no less than single space.  Tables, drawings and header/footer information shall be 10 point Arial font or larger.  If any of the material provided contains proprietary information, then mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Responses should include, but are not limited to the following:<BR>Company History: A history to include previous major products and primary customer base.  Additionally, RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Governments consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for production, integration, engineering, training, field support, and other services including handling of the classified information up to SECRET. The respondents should focus on a proven track record and specific examples of producing and delivering systems similar in scope and complexity to the Cerberus system on an urgent and expedited basis, preferably within a Quick Response Capability (QRC) framework. <BR>If you believe your firm possesses the technical capability, financial, facility, equipment and personnel resources, and relevant experience/past performance to perform the type of work specified above as a prime contractor, then request you also submit information stated below.  If your anticipated participation will be that of a small business joint-venture, then you must identify each joint venture participant.  If participation will be that of a newly formed small business joint venture, provide the information required by items 3 through 7 for each participant in the joint venture.<BR><BR>1.	Company name and mailing address.<BR>2.	Point of contact (name, telephone number, and e-mail address).<BR>3.	Socio-economic status under the above stated NAICS (e.g., other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled-veteran owned small business, etc.).  <BR>4.	Current number of employees.<BR>5.	Identify the percentage of work that you, as a prime contractor, are capable of performing in each major technical function for which you are capable.<BR>6.

MCSC is also investigating moving to a full or partial Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) model. The pistol's operating environment is characterized by high usage in training, rough handling and environments on deployments, and limited access to repair and maintenance resources during high tempo operations. MCSC may procure up to 4,000 units, of which half will be in heavy use/deployed to combat theaters at any given time.MCSC may be interested in a pistol with the following draft characteristics:
Semi-automatic, .45 ACP caliber. Single stack magazine must hold at least 7 rounds. It is desirable  that the pistol function with the Marine Corps .45 ACP 7-round magazine (NSN 1005-01-373-2774) used in the current MEUSOC pistol.  Pistol must have an accessory rail meeting MIL-STD-1913 specifications to mount accessories. It must have a grip safety and an ambidextrous manual safety which are operable by users wearing cold weather and NBC gloves.  It has dull, non reflective surfaces and uses standard military colors. It must lock the slide or bolt to the rear after the last round in the magazine is fired. It has a beveled magazine well to facilitate rapid loading. The pistol has a lanyard loop attachment point.
It can hold a five shot group to an average of no more than 4 inches by 4 inches at 25 yards. It should be no more than 9 inches in length and weigh less than 4.5 pounds with empty magazine. It has a consistent trigger pull of 5  1 pounds.  The pistol can demonstrate reliability of an average minimum of 300 rounds between stoppages and 5,000 rounds between parts failures. Magazines should remain serviceable for at least 3,000 rounds.  The pistol will perform reliably after being subjected to standard MIL SPEC environmental tests, drop tests, and temperature extremes. The pistol must demonstrate "drop in" parts interchangeability, with no milling, filing, or fitting required. There shall be no degradation in performance after parts are exchanged. The pistol is resistant to corrosion and chemicals, and is compatible with current military approved small arms cleaning, lubrication, and preservative and storage agents.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is in the process of seeking a near-term replacement for the Automated Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) in Marine Corps tactical wheeled vehicles (TWVs) identified herein. This RFI seeks to obtain data from sources that are capable of fully satisfying this need. The information requested is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for a potential requirement. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and / or released to the public. However, proprietary information received in response to this market research synopsis will be safeguarded and protected in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Proprietary information submitted as a result of this market research shall be marked in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e). The Government is seeking suitable commercial items, developmental items, or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. Information on capable sources is sought for the following desired characteristics: 
The system must provide the ability to protect Marines against internal cab fires caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other munitions.  An aqueous based, non-toxic fire suppression agent and delivery system mounted in the vehicle cab is desired.  The fire suppression agent should also employ cooling properties which immediately cool the cab environment and provide protection from skin burns to personnel in the cab.  The system should be designed to be automatically activated by system sensors that detect a fire event and should also provide a manual discharge option. The system shall be compatible with a vehicle electrical system per MIL-STD-1275, characteristics of 28 volt DC Electrical Systems in Military Vehicle, without generic any false alarms or suffering to any systems or platform components. The system shall be operated over an input voltage range of 18-30 VDC and is desired to draw no more than 30 amps during extinguisher(s) discharge. The system should not cause hearing damage to occupants of the cab after activation. The Government desires a system comparable in weight and space claim to the current FM 200 AFES system which is currently employed in Marine Corps and Army TWVs.  This system shall be initially designed and tested in Marine Corps HMMWVs and shall have minimal effect on the existing configuration of the HMMWV cab.  The system must not interfere with the crew's ability to egress and ingress of the vehicle.
An Industry Day for interested vendors will be held at Marine Corps Systems Command during November of 2009.  During the Industry Day vendors in attendance will be free to take measurements and photographs of Marine Corps HMMWVs in order to assess cab dimensions, space claim, etc.  Interested parties should contact the Government Contract Specialist listed below for additional information.  Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessaryinformation to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contacts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successfulprocurement of the requirements, if solicited.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Neuro Kinetics, Pittsburgh, PA 15238.<BR><BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The proposed purchase of services from Neuro Kinetics is for the installation of a rotary chair in the ENT clinic. The rotary chair is critical in assessing patients with dizziness after mild traumatic brain injury suffered in combat.  The device requires specific power voltage and amperage that are available in the hospital. The chair installation must comply with the following as detailed in the statement of work:<BR><BR>"	Bring a 30 amp/208V circuit to the room from previously identified existing points of connection as directed by Facilities Management. <BR>"	Saw-cuts into existing walls, as required <BR>"	1-100 amp 120/207 volt 3 phase 4 wire panel board placed next to the existing panel SCK2L1-B.<BR>"	1-100 amp 3 pole breaker for panel SCK2L1-B to feed the new 100 amp panel.<BR>"	2-20 amp 3 pole breakers for the new panel (1 breaker to feed existing load which will be moved to the new panel in order to make room for the new 100 amp 3 pole breaker in panel SCK2L1-B).<BR>"	10-100 amps 3 phase 4 wire feeders from existing panelSCK2L1-B to new 100 amp panel.<BR>"	60-20 amps 3 phase branch circuit conduit and wire from new 100 amp panel to NOTC suite.<BR>"	1-30amp 250 volt 3 pole fusible safety switch with 20 amp fuses.<BR>"	1-30 amp 250 volt 3 pole non fusible safety switch.<BR>"	 conduit with a #8 wire from transformer to building steel.<BR>"	Conduit and wire for the 20 amp 3 phase circuit from the fusible switch to the isolation transformer, to the non fusible switch, to the NOTC Control Console Cabinet.<BR>"	Install customer supplied 5 KVA isolation transformer.<BR>"	Installation must be performed according to Neuro Kinetics rotary chair power specifications<BR>"	Training for use of rotary chair<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Neuro Kinetics is the preferred installer of the rotary chair as they are the manufacturer. It is essential that the rotary chair system be installed properly. Incorrect installation may damage or render inoperable the Neuro Kinetics rotary chair. Any delay could set back our research risking meeting milestones and loss command support. Neuro Kinetics is registered as a Defense Manufacturer and Supplier per CAGE Code # 47419.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A search was conducted between 25 Feb and 1 Mar 2010 using Internet search engines, the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search. The CCR and SBA search referenced NAICS code 622110 General Medical and Surgical Hospitals and keywords rotary chair service, electrical, transformer service and electric engineering. <BR>The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned no small businesses associated with both the NAICS 622110 and any of the relevant keywords. Some local vendors were found that may a variety of comparable services. <BR>Internet research found that the services that may best accomplish the statement of work of the rotary chair installation are available from Neuro Kinetics. <BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>None<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>Based on the results of the research, it appears that the installation of the pre-existing Neuro Kinetics rotary chair is best conducted by the chair manufacturer. Although the electrical and power installations can be met by other vendors there is the risk of damage to the equipment if the work is done incorrectly. As the rotary chair is a high cost item to replace there should be no risks taken to fulfill the installation requirements. Neuro Kinetics is vendor that is capable of meeting all the requirements.<BR><BR>6.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent.  The Government intends to enter into a non-competitive 2-month interim contract, under NAICS code 561720, with the incumbent contractor, American Facility Services, Inc, 1325 Union Hill Industrial CT. STE A, Alpharetta, GA 30004-5693, for the period of 1 Apr  31 May 2010.  The incumbent is a SB company under the applicable NAICS code.  Due to unexpected delays in the reviewing process for the follow-on contract under solicitation number W91151-09-R-0003. Initiating a separate competitive action for a 2-month interim contract is not cost effective or efficient. Time does not permit a phase-in period, therefore, there's not a reasonable expectation a new contractor will successfully perform without critical delays and/or interruption of service.<BR>The Interim contract action is for providing personnel management, and any other items and services, not Government furnished, necessary to perform the installation custodial service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the current contract W91151-04-D-0013. This procurement is a small business 100% set-aside. The resultant contract will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract period of performance 1 Apr  31 May 2010.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561720 Janitorial services and the Small Business Size Standard is $16.5M. <BR><BR>Firms are requested to submit any questions regarding this non-competitive 2-month interim contract via e-mail to Contract Specialist Ms. Johanna Goodman, e-mail address johanna.goodman@us.army.mil phone 254-287-6495 and copy Susheep Oden, Contracting Officer e-mail address susheep.oden@us.army.mil phone 254-287-5479, no later than 24 March 2010 at 1400 CDT.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total and broad Government requirement for the following products to the PL:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 31, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<DESC>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado intends to award a Sole Source Commercial Contract to Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), 15 Centennial Drive, Peabody, MA 01960 who is a large business. USAFA/DFEM and the Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) have a need for a vibration isolator platform for the newly-acquired FEI Helios NanoLab which will reside on the second floor of Fairchild Hall. Because of vibrations on the second floor, the Helios NanoLab requires a vibration isolator to meet the manufacturer's quoted equipment specifications. Currently, USAFA lacks any sort of vibration isolation system that would provide what is required by the Helios NanoLab. The requirement is for a TMC "Stacis SEM-Base" (STACIS FP Model No. 25-37394-01) as specified by FEI Company, the vendor for the Helios NanoLab.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334519 and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide the required vibration isolator platform for the FEI Helios NanoLab may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide this service. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be received NLT 4:30 p.m. MST on 22 Mar 10. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>

<DESC>This special notice announces a Hawaii Renewable Energy and BioEnergy Industry Forum, co-hosted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Navy (DoN).  It will be held on April 6 and 7, 2010 at the Marine Corp Base Hawaii Officer's Club, Lanai Ballroom.  Earlier this year, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support President Obama's initiative to reduce energy consumption derived from fossil fuels and increase energy production from renewable energy sources. The purpose of the Hawaii Renewable Energy and BioEnergy Industry Forum is to formally announce the MOU partnership between the USDA and the DoN and to present information about the initiatives that are occurring in Hawaii at a public information event. Hawaii has been selected as the location for the initial collaboration between USDA and the Navy because Hawaii's energy costs are among the highest in the nation and imported oil supplies 90 percent of the State's energy. Also, a viable agricultural sector can enhance Hawaii's energy security, and energy projects can help rural economies.
The agenda for April 6 is attached. The agenda for April 7 is being finalized. It is anticipated that the following areas will be covered: biofuel generation, renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles and battery energy storage. 
To register for the event, please fill in the attached registration form and submit via e-mail to NFPACQ2@navy.mil or via fax to (808)471-5881 no later than 4:00 p.m. (HST) March 26, 2010.
Due to the size of the facility, companies will be allowed to register up to three (3) people. However, if additional space is available after March 26, 2010, companies will be allowed more than three (3) people based on the order the registrations are received.  Therefore, please submit all interested participants by the deadline and the first three (3) names on the lists will be registered until it is determined that additional space is available.   Access to MCBH requires that all participants must pre-register in order to attend the industry forum.  Only registered participants will be provided with further instructions on how to gain access onto MCBH via email.
Those individuals needing special accommodations, please contact the USDA Farm Service Agency at (808)441-2704, ext 148.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-09-C-0020, Operations and Maintenance of Gov't Owned Facilities<br><br>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Columbus, Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561210 applies to this contract award. The contractor will perform lock closure at Coffeeville Lock and Dam. The contractor will: set stop logs, dewater, inspect, repair and repaint miter gates as necessary. Inspect, replace or repair as necessary the cathodic protection systems, grease lines, gate timbers, steel, and seals, etc. at Coffeeville Lock. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract Clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated. This existing contract must be used because:   1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, paint miter gates and inspection.   2)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.   The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>The Sensors, Measurement, and Instrumentation , (SM&I) ITL has been tasked by GSL to provide acceleration measurement support to this ongoing research program - The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization Hard Impact Program at Fort Polk, LA.  During the course of these experiments, it will be required to record a range of acceleration data.  In order to obtain this data, it is necessary to procure 200 G, 2KG, 6KG, and 20 KG accelerometers from Endevco.  Historically, SM&I Branch has used high-G accelerometers from a variety of companies to support GSL'S research programs.  One company that has provided consistent and reliable accelerometers is Endevco.  Due to the reliability and accuracy of the Endevco accelerometers , the need to rerun expensive field tests has been reduced.  As the result of using accelerometers from Endevco for over 25 years, all current instrumentations, software, and mounting hardware are configured to support these sensors.<BR>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-98-H-5013-0054. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure. <BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>2.

Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survery will be provided to the references provided. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the statement of work.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the statement of work</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>

<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performnace information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, credentials, magnitude of work (meaning size of church, number of choirs, breadth of experience), flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs, ability of contractor to work and respond kindly to various types of people, and the ability to respond to needs that are specific to the Protestant Evangelical faith.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower and it is in the best interest of the government to do so. <br />i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.</p>

The US Forest Service, Region 1 - Northern Region has a requirement for  Architect/Engineering services, indefinite quantity indefinite delivery contracts for Materials Testing and Geotechnical Services for the National Grasslands and Forests in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and North Idaho. Architect/Engineering firms which meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit: (1) a SF 330 Part II, General Qualifications, (2) a SF 330 Part 1, Contract Specific Qualifications and (3) any requested supplemental data to the procurement office shown below.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380 with a size standard of $4.5 million. Following an initial evaluation of the qualifications and performance data submitted, one or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation.  Multiple firms may be selected from this announcement.  Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include (1) Professional qualifications; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Location in the general geographical area; (4) Capacity; (5) Past performance. The projects performed under this contract will primarily focus on professional services to provide Geotechnical, Pavement and Materials engineering and associated Materials Testing services predominately to the Northern Region (Region One).  The work involves engineering services related to low-volume road and facility design and construction in Region One of the USDA Forest Service.  Required services are primarily in the areas of asphalt, chip seals, concrete, aggregate surface, and aggregate stabilized pavements; construction materials testing and inspections on all types of roads and facilities; inspections, investigation, analysis and design for pavements, small dams, hydraulic structures, landslides, retaining structures, foundations, and rock sources.  Only firms with Registered Professional Engineers licensed in one of the States of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota with eligibility for reciprocity in one or more of the other states will be considered for award of the contract.  The Contractors associated laboratory must be nationally accredited by AASHTO or equivalent in Asphalt, Concrete and Aggregate Testing.  The Government may elect to award a single or multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts for the same or similar services to one or more sources for professional road (pavement) Construction Materials Testing, construction monitoring, and geo-technical services for the Region. The contracts will be issued as a one-year base contract with four one-year options (potential of five years). However, the Government reserves the right to award only one contract for the combined areas.  Task orders will be issued as needed to accomplish the work. Contract time will vary with each individual task order.   The Architect-Engineering firm must demonstrate its, and each key subcontractors, qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Contractor qualifications will be assessed using the criteria outlined below.  Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance to the Government.  Specific evaluation factors include: 1.  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services: Offeror will address criteria in SF 330. Professional qualifications of great importance to the Government include licensing of skills applicable to this work in the state(s) services will be performed and experience in the type of services required.  Specifically small dams, secondary/low traffic roads, and aggregate surfaced roads is more valuable than experience provided on interstate highways or large water barriers (dikes, levees, or dams). Of less value is an offeror with minimum number of qualified personnel on the team; or team that does not have a history of working together.  2.  Specialized experienced and technical competence in the type of work required: Offeror will address in SF 330. Specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities of great importance to the Government include experience and expertise in low-volume asphalt and chipseal pavements; small dams; hydraulic structures; landslides; retaining structures; foundations; rock sources; aggregate and stabilized aggregate surfaced roads; and secondary roads such as parks, camp grounds, small developments, etc.  Offerors demonstrating experience only in major highways, large bridges, major water barriers, on flat terrain will not have the same understanding of the required design considerations and associated problems typical of the small/lower volume facilities on steep Forest lands and therefore will be rated lower.  3.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project. Offer is required to demonstrate an understanding of hazards when traveling on Forest roads to project sites; an understanding of the types of remote areas projects sites may be located; unique and varied geological features found in the Northern Region.  The variety of unique and complex geological features common to the North West and Northern Mid-West areas of Region1 include all types of bed rock structure, with random and frequent structural discontinuities, overlain frequently with glacial deposits.  The more familiar a team is with these unique geologic features and the associated common design and construction problems, the more effective and efficient they will be designing solutions and solving problems. As a result, teams with project experience in this or similar geologic regimes will be given a higher rating; offerors less familiar will be rated lower; offerors that have no experience working in such geology will be rated unsatisfactory.  Offerors familiar with working in remote areas subject to limited communication, changing weather conditions, exposure to dangerous or aggressive wildlife will be rated higher than those that have worked in urban environments and mild climates.  Offerors will also frequently be required to deliver and pick up samples and conduct specialized tests at the Regional Forest Service Materials Laboratory in Missoula, Montana.  4.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time: Offeror is to provide information regarding team ability and capacity to perform multiple tasks over a broad area in a short construction season. Offerors demonstrating the ability to efficiently mobilize and respond to a broad variety of services located on multiple Forests will be rated higher than those having to travel considerable distances or have limited resources for field investigation and inspection portion of these services.  5.  Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality if work, and compliance with performance schedules. Offerors record of satisfactory performance in providing similar services to Federal and State land management agencies in the North Western part of the US during the past 3 years. Offerors are required to provide a list of references that will be randomly checked by the Government. Firms demonstrating a track record of customer satisfaction for similar work in similar conditions will be rated higher than firms that have not performed to customer satisfactory, or have not performed similar work under similar conditions.  In addition to the technical evaluation criteria, the Forest Service may administratively elect to consider the volume of work previously awarded to the A&E firm 1) to determine which of the most highly qualified A&E firms should be awarded a particular project and/or 2) as a method to permit qualified A&E firms to gain experience so that they can compete as a most highly qualified firm on future A&E contracts. Type of contract is a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity.  The duration of this contract will be for 1 year from the date of initial award with 4 - one year option periods.  The cumulative total amount available for all awards made (including one or more contracts, all option years and all task orders issued under all awards) is $3,000,000.00.  The minimum guarantee for each contract awarded (including option years) will be the value of the first task order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contracts at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the contract.  The proposed contract is being solicited as a total small business set-aside.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Orthopedic Services at the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Center, Lame Deer, Montana. The Contractor shall provide two &frac12; day clinics per month during the base year and three &frac12; day clinics per month for Option Years 1-4. The clinic schedule will be coordinated with the Physical Therapist/Outreach Orthopedic Clinic Coordinator at the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit. MAJOR DUTIES: The Contractor shall evaluate and treat patients in need of an orthopedic specialty care provider. The provider must be a licensed orthopedic surgeon or licensed physician assistant who works directly with an orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon must provide at least one &frac12; day clinic per month during the base year and at least two of the &frac12; day clinics each month during the option years. The work involves all aspects of outpatient orthopedic care with patients who have an extremely wide variety of physical and emotional health problems. The orthopedic provider will perform services within their legal scope of practice and participate in the coordination of care with other healthcare providers. The orthopedic provider will have access to radiology services and treatment rooms suitable for seeing patients with orthopedic needs. The Contractor will be required to complete peer reviews as requested by the Chief Medical Officer. Peer reviews will be completed by an orthopedic surgeon for an orthopedic surgeon and for a physician assistant by another physician assistant or orthopedic surgeon. The peer reviews will be reviewed by the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit Chief Medical Officer. The Contractor will be required to complete medical records in accordance with Northern Cheyenne Service Unit policies and procedures and AAAHC accreditation requirements. All reports will be placed in the patient's medical record at the Service Unit and at the Contractor's facility. The work may be complex, requiring consultation with other healthcare providers and specialists. The work requires simultaneous application of multiple knowledge, skills, and abilities in orthopedics. The purpose of the work is to provide direct patient care, which directly affects the health and well being of individual patients, patient families and impacts the health status of the entire community served. Offsite services provided by the orthopedic group including surgeries, MRI and radiology services, or other procedures and urgent/emergent office visits and diagnostic testing, will be subject to approval by the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit Contract Care Committee and funded through the Contract Health Service Department. All radiology services that can be provided by the Service Unit prior to a visit will be performed in-house. The guidelines include Public Health Service, Indian Health Service, Billings Area Office, Service Unit and Outpatient Department staff regulations, policies and procedures. In nearly all cases, the orthopedic provider's professional judgment will be used for determining the care that is in the patient's best interest. Personal contacts are with patients, families of patients, medical officers and other health professionals, other ancillary employees, administrators and healthcare providers from the private sector. The purpose of the contacts is to obtain and exchange health information, resolve problems, educate, influence, and motivate individuals and groups to understand and accept recommended medical information, diagnosis, and treatment. The work involves standing, bending and lifting patients throughout the work day; and handling needles and medication for injection which pose a risk for individual injury. Injuries could also result from physically handling patients or with working with patients that may be emotionally disoriented. The work is performed in an outpatient setting with continued exposure to patients having a variety of illnesses and communicable diseases. The Contractor may be subjected to adverse weather and hostile patients and/or their families. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from May 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010, with four 12-month options.

SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation; therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences.

<SUBJECT>Robotics Automation System Repairs
<SOLNBR>MSHA-001-ROBOT
<RESPDATE>042010
<CONTACT>Jo D. Scott, Email scott.jo@dol.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking a vendor to correct a critical design flaw in a robotics automation system currently in use in the Dust Section of MSHA's National Mine Air and Dust Laboratory, located in Mount Hope, West Virginia. This laboratory analyzes mine air samples for the presence of poisonous and/or explosive gases, and coal mine dust samples for total incombustible content (TIC), particle size, the presence and degree of coked material, and silica content. This is the agency's sole facility that performs the TIC analysis, and this test is done for all MSHA coal districts nationwide. Robotics automation systems are utilized in the dust laboratory to automate the analysis process, reduce the personnel and costs associated wit the testing, and keep up with the ever-increasing sample load. The robotics automation system in question utilizes an ABB IRB 140 Industrial robot purchased from Fidelis Automation Incorporated, formerly of Mansfield, Ohio. Unfortunately, Fidelis Automation is no longer in business and this work must be done by another vendor.
<p>SCOPE &amp; DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>1. The robotics system utilizes an ABB IRB 140 Industrial Robot with Motor Type-B. The Serial Number of this robot is 14M-50230, and the date of manufacture is 5/17/2005. It is a six-axis, electric servo-driven robot with a custom three-position End of Arm Tool (EOAT). This custom EOAT provides a gripper to locate and pick up 10-ml glass test tubes containing prepared dust samples; a second gripper to lift, move and place porcelain crucibles; and a third gripper to lift, move and place stainless steel trays designed to hold twenty-five (25) sample crucibles. The design flaw in question is with this third sample tray gripper. It has proven to be ineffective in handling the weight of the crucible trays, maintaining the precise tolerances of the various tray positions and providing dependable, consistent functioning during the analysis process.<br />2. Vendor will evaluate the current EOAT to analyze the design and functional problems and to prepare proposals for possible solutions. Digital photographs and initial system design diagrams may be provided to the interested vendors, but a site visit to observe the system is strongly recommended.<br />3. Vendor will provide proposals to correct the problems with the current EOAT which may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following solutions: (a) re-designing and re-fitting the current EOAT to perform the tasks needed; (b) designing, fabricating, testing and installing a new EOAT on the existing robot; (c) modifying or re-designing the sixteen (16) stainless steel crucible trays utilized by this EOAT; or (d) a combination of the previous options.<br />4. Vendor will provided an on-site service technician to install the new or re-designed hardware, teach the new robot positions, provide technical assistance to MSHA lab personnel and ensure the proper operation of the new or re-designed EOAT.</p>
<p>VENDOR RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>1. Assign a dedicated agent or employee to oversee the planning and implementation of the repairs and reprogramming.<br />2. Submit design drawings for review and approval before proceeding with detail drawings, materials purchases, or equipment build or alteration. If changes are requested by the Purchaser at the approval stage, Vendor will review the changes and respond within five (5) business days by stating in writing what effect, if any, such changes will have on the terms of the Purchase Order agreement. If changes are accepted, and amended Purchase Order must be agreed upon by both parties.<br />3. Provide all parts and labor necessary to achieve the goals of this solicitation and resolve the issues with the robotics system.<br />4. Provide electronic or paper copies of all documentation associated with the project. This includes, but is not limited to, all design drawings, parts lists and detailed assembly drawings.<br />5. Provide a minimum of one (1) year warranty on all work performed under this Purchase Order. Vendor is not responsible for other components or processes of the system, or for the accuracy of the data produced, but must guarantee the new EOAT hardware functionality and associated programming necessary to utilize the new EOAT hardware.<br />6. Adhere to federal government regulations regarding travel and hotel expenses, daily meal allowances and work day schedules.<br />7. Repair work shall be completed as soon as possible to expedite the return to service of the dust robotics system. Target completed of the contracted work should be within 6-8 weeks after receipt of the signed Purchase Order (ARO).</p>
<p>PURCHASER'S RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>1. Provide utility and control access to the robotics system as required by the Vendor.<br />2. Provide existing cell components to the Vendor as needed. These may include crucible trays, crucible tray racks, empty crucibles, test tube racks, empty test tubes, dust samples for testing, or other system-related items.</p>

<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 541690. The small business size standard is $7.0.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 Ecological Surveys S.E. Bering Sea, Period of performance date of award through February 28, 2013.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />Spatial and temporal mapping of near-shore juvenile fish and settling crab in the North Aleutian Basin</p>
<p>SCOPE OR MISSION:<br />This work will be part of a study of marine larval and juvenile fish and settling crab in the vicinity of the proposed North Aleutian Basin Lease Area to provide information required by the Minerals Management Service for the approval of exploration and/or development plans. The information gathered will also provide information required by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration for ecosystem-based management of the fisheries in the region.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF WORK:<br />The specific area to be covered is from Port Heiden to Cold Bay, Alaska along the northern shore from the shore to the 20 m isobath, which is about 3 miles offshore along most of the coast.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />This project was developed in discussions with the Minerals Management Service about how to provide sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to describe the distribution of near-shore juvenile fish and settling crab in the North Aleutian Basin.</p>
<p>WORK TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>Task 1. Local knowledge and relevant literature<br />Identify and review the existing knowledge database for the area. This database will include, but is not limited to, published studies in the literature, MMS reports, Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) reports, and interviews with people who have been working in the area. The last category will include interviews with fisheries biologists from ADFG and NOAA as appropriate and also commercial fishers. The report will also include a description of ongoing scientific studies in the area, and identify those with which collaboration might be desirable.</p>
<p>Task 2. Adapt survey to local conditions<br />Using the contacts made under task one, the contractor shall monitor biological activity in the region from May to August, 2010. This monitoring will take advantage of any formal and informal reports that are available. In addition, dedicated visual surveys shall be conducted from an aircraft over the area during a four week period. The specific period will be chosen to capture the highest levels of biological activity, as identified under task one.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct net sampling to obtain and process samples in the region of interest. This work will use a series of tow nets from small vessels capable of sampling phytoplankton, small zooplankton species, large zooplankton (including crab larvae and larval fish) and juvenile fish species. Using hook and line, predator fish shall be sampled and the stomach contents preserved to aid in detecting mobile forage fish and juvenile fish species that may be difficult to capture with tow nets or that are patchy and therefore difficult to effectively sample. These ground sampling efforts should be conducted 1-3 times a week, depending on weather, in areas identified by the visual surveys. These areas will include "hot spots" where fish schools or foraging events have been observed, as well as "cold spots" where no schools or foraging have been visually observed from the air. This will enable us to detect "background" biological levels of activity and identify characteristics that define "hot spots".</p>
<p>Using all the information collected under this task and task one, the contractor shall develop an optimal survey strategy for the lidar and multi-spectral surveys to be conducted in 2011 and 2012. The area to be covered is from Port Heiden to Cold Bay, Alaska along the northern shore from the shore to the 20 m isobath, which is about 3 miles offshore along most of the coast, about 170 nm of coastline.</p>
<p>Task 3. Perform key surveys over the second and third years of the contract.<br />Visual surveys, similar to those performed in year one, will also be performed in 2011 and 2012 to allow a comparison between the first and subsequent years. As in year one, the contractor shall also conduct net sampling to obtain and process samples in the region of interest. This work will use a series of tow nets from small vessels capable of sampling phytoplankton, small zooplankton species, large zooplankton (including crab larvae and larval fish) and juvenile fish species. Using hook and line, predator fish shall be sampled and the stomach contents preserved to aid in detecting mobile forage fish and juvenile fish species that may be difficult to capture with tow nets or that are patchy and therefore difficult to effectively sample. These ground sampling efforts should be conducted 1-3 times a week, depending on weather, in areas identified by the visual surveys. These areas will include "hot spots" where fish schools or foraging events have been observed, as well as "cold spots" where no schools or foraging have been visually observed from the air. This will enable us to detect "background" biological levels of activity and identify characteristics that define "hot spots".</p>
<p>Task 4. Coordinate adaptive sampling <br />In years two and three, the contractor shall coordinate the aerial surveys with marine mammal and bird surveys in the study region. If the scheduling of those corresponds with the optimal timing of lidar surveys, the lidar survey design will be adapted to make best use of those data. If they do not correspond, the contractor will make arrangements to obtain copies of any data that will help the goals of this project. These surveys would, of course, include the MMS program, "Distribution, Abundance, and Habitat Use of North Pacific Right Whales," by the NOAA National Marine Mammal Laboratory. Other pertinent studies will be identified at the Marine Science in Alaska symposia in 2011 and 2012 and during the visual survey period in 2010.</p>
<p>The next level of coordination is to actually combine data collection. Assuming use of the NOAA Twin Otter, there is plenty of space on the aircraft for marine mammal and bird observers. The contractor shall work with marine mammal and bird projects to see if they would like to fly the Fish LIDAR during visual surveys. The LIDAR and multispectral imager would provide a context of near surface zooplankton and fish distributions for the visual observations. These data would, of course, also extend the spatial and temporal extent of our data set. If this turns out to be feasible, a separate budget and logistical plan will be developed by the 2011 Marine Science in Alaska symposium.</p>
<p>Task 5. Data input and analysis<br />A data analysis plan shall be produced during the planning for the aerial surveys. It will be based on the results of Tasks 1 and 2, in which the key species and their spatial and temporal distributions will be described. This plan should include a discussion of adaptive sampling, where the LIDAR flights are modified based on the results of the visual surveys and sampling results. The data analysis plan will describe any statistical tests to be used in the analysis of the data.</p>
<p>Task 6. Synthesize results<br />The contractor shall collect all of the available information from previous studies, from informal sources, and from this study. This information will be examined for statistically significant spatial and temporal patterns. Of particular interest are geographically localized biological hotspots, and the underlying physical reasons for the existence of any hotspots. Also of interest are ephemeral foraging events, which could produce a significant amount of energy transfer to higher trophic levels over the course of just a few days. Additional hypotheses to be considered will arise during the course of Task 1, the review of the existing knowledge base. In addition to figures in the final report, the spatial information generated will also be provided in the form of GIS layers. This emphasis will include recommendations for future monitoring programs, including suggestions as to the best mix of lidar, multispectral, and visual observations for long-term monitoring in the region.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE: <br />&bull; Quarterly progress reports<br />&bull; Report on the results of Task 1 - May 1, 2010<br />&bull; Report on the results of Task 2 - December 31, 2010<br />&bull; Plan for coordinated adaptive sampling and data analysis plan for 2011 - June 1, 2011<br />&bull; Report on the results of Task 3 for 2011 - December 31, 2011 <br />&bull; Plan for coordinated adaptive sampling and data analysis plan for 2012 - June 1, 2012<br />&bull; Report on the results of Task 3 for 2012 - December 31, 2012<br />&bull; Report on the results of Task 6 - December 31, 2012<br />&bull; Attend Symposium on Marine Science in Alaska - January 2011, 2012, and 2013</p>

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is seeking proposals from parties interested in performing policy studies, conferences, and other development programs in support of fair international protection of intellectual property rights.  

The USPTO intends to competitively issue joint project agreements to conduct these programs.  Interested parties are advised that information is requested subject to the authority contained in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act language and no contractual awards subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will be issued. 

On December 16, 2009, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 3288) into law (P.L. 111-117). The law, in part, provides that no less than $4 million of appropriated amounts shall be available only for the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) contribution in a cooperative or joint agreement or agreements with a non-profit organization or organizations to conduct policy studies, conferences, and other development programs, in support of fair international protection of intellectual property rights.

In accordance with the law, three requirements must be met in order for an organization to be eligible to enter into an agreement with the USPTO.  First, the organization must be a non-profit organization.  Second, the non-profit organization must have been successfully audited within the previous year.  Third, the non-profit organization must have previous experience in such programs.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

<p>The U.S. Air Force's Air Combat Command, with headquarters at Langley AFB, VA is the primary provider of air combat forces to America's Unified Combatant Commands. ACC operates fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle-management, rescue and theater airlift aircraft, as well as command, control, communications and intelligence systems. ACC provides forces for the five geographical, unified commands - U.S. Central Command, U.S. Southern Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and U.S. Northern Command including air defense forces for the North American Aerospace Defense Command. As a force provider, ACC organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and employment while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of peace and wartime air sovereignty and air defense missions. ACC prepares combat air forces to globally implement national policy by sponsoring the ATLANTIC STRIKE (AS) Exercise Program. AS is designed to provide realistic training in the conduct of the counter-land close battle for combat Aircrews, Joint Terminal Air Controllers, Intelligence, and Air Support Operations Squadron personnel. AS is conducted at Avon Park Air-Ground Training Complex, Avon Park, FL.

Price analysis techniques may include a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison with other contract prices for similar services, and/or a comparison of proposed prices with the independent government cost estimate. Price will be evaluated on the total overall price and reasonableness. A combination of evaluation techniques will be accomplished IAW FAR 15.404-1(b). The Government will evaluate proposed prices to determine whether prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal.</p>

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) - <BR><BR>a. The Government will award one contract as a result of this solicitation, but reserves the right to award no contracts, if no offers are found to be acceptable for award. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <BR><BR>i. Technical capability of offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; (iii) price/cost (see FAR 15.304)<BR><BR>1. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important when compared to price. <BR><BR>b. Options- The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>d. All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees using in accordance with the process identified below, conducted as follows: <BR><BR>i. Factors to be Evaluated: <BR><BR>1. Factor 1 Technical Approach<BR><BR>2. Factor 2 Past Performance<BR><BR>3. Factor 3 Price <BR><BR>ii. The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is as follows: Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR>iii. Phase I - The non-price factors will be evaluated to support best-value trade-off process for the two non-price factors. The non-price factors will be assigned an adjective rating and proposals with an adjective rating below acceptable will not be considered for award. The following adjective ratings will be assigned to the offerors technical and past performance portion of the proposal: <BR><BR><BR>1. Excellent -The technical proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the prototype provides strengths which are supported in the written technical proposal. The technical factors are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>2. Good - The technical proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Past performance indicates little doubt that the offeror perform the required effort. <BR><BR>3. Acceptable- The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>4. Marginal - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.<BR><BR>5. Unacceptable - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record<BR><BR>iv. The Government will evaluate the Price factor of the proposals.

<DESC>This amendment 000001 is issued to cancel the site tour scheduled 3/22/2010. The project sites cannot be accessed at this time due to winter conditions. The roads are wet and slick causing unsafe access for the public as well as resource damage. Additionally, since this is a service contract for equipment rental, it's not necessary for vendors to see the sites, as it will not have an impact on quote price. Upon award, a pre-work meeting will be held with the awarded contractor. At that time, the two project sites will be visited extensively.

(Amended 17 March 2010). ________________________________________________________________<br /><br />QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (16 MARCH 2010)<br /><br /></span></strong>QUESTION 1:&nbsp; Can the Government provide an IGCE?<br /><br />ANSWER 1:&nbsp; No, the Government does not provide that type of information for a soliciation.<br /><br />QUESTION 2:&nbsp; Is there an incumbent currently providing the services requested? And if there is, who is the incumbent?<br /><br />ANSWER 2:&nbsp; No, there are currently no vendors providing these services.<br /><br />QUESTION 3: Is NGA requiring assistance for ISO Certification or contractor support separate from the certification?<br /><br />ANSWER 3:&nbsp; The registrar will perform the assessments listed in the SOW. We are not requiring consulting services, the requirement is for ISO registrar services.<br /><br />QUESTION 4:&nbsp; According to "Section 3.1 Assessments" of Solicitation No HM017710R0010, it appears that the NGA is looking for a registrar and not a contractor to help conduct internal audits. Would the Government please clarify whether this is the case?<br /><br />ANSWER 4:&nbsp; The term "contractor" is a general term equivalent to "vendor" or "company". "Registrar" and "Certification Body" are more specific terms, but in the context of this SOW they are synonymous. A "company" not accredited as a "registrar" cannot perform the required services.<br /><br /><strong><br />___________________________________________________________<br />SECTION 3.8 OF THE SOLICITATION IS HEREBY MODIFIED TO INSERT THE NAME OF THE CONTRACTOR UNDER PROVISION 5X52.209-9004 - USE OF CONTRACTOR SUPPORT (OCT 2009).

The due date for quotations, March 23, 2010, at 3:30 PM Eastern Time, remains unchanged.

QUESTION 1: Has an 3He gas allocation been approved by he Department of Energy for this requirement?  Shall 3He be included in the cost of line item 0001 or as a separate line item? If it is to be included, what cost basis should be used?

RESPONSE1: NIST has a fairly large approved allocation of 3He gas earmarked for use in a number of projects.  This detector is one of those projects.  The resultant purchase order from NIST should serve as an indication to the Department of Energy or gas vendor that this is an approved use.  

NIST intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation.  It is the decision of the quoter how to quote the 3He.

AMENDMENT NO. 2:

The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification based on questions raised.

1.  On the question on shelving length.  The over-all length will be slightly longer per shelving unit than the 96 inch dimension due to the thickness of the uprights.  What we are needing is 96 inches of useable shelf dimension to accommodate the number of boxes per shelf.  Typically, this pallet racking type shelving uses starter units with uprights on both ends and then "add-on" units that have uprights on one end.  These add no's attach to the ends of each other.  We have allowed for the creep in length in the floor plan layout.  Also, color is of no concern.

2. The Government needs to have the uprights fabricated to the specified height due to the 9 foot ceilings and the 18 inch setback for the overhead sprinklers. The height is 7 feet 4 inches.


All other specifications/plans will remain the same.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. The solicitation will be available for viewing or downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov only. This solicitation will be issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items or Service, in its solicitation for the described services.

<p>If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Crystal B.

This bridge contract will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Sill Installation pending award of a competitive 8(a) follow-on contract.  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is seeking a small business to perform as a biospecimen repository facility for the competitive renewal of the Maintenance of the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository Program.  The objective of this initiative is to continue to acquire, store, and distribute quality biospecimens to the scientific community using standardized processes and procedures.  This is a five-year requirement for a repository facility that will provide long-term storage and distribution of biospecimens to the wider scientific community.  Access to the stored biospecimens and linkage to biospecimen data are coordinated by the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) supported by a separate contract (contract #HHSN268200800012C).

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about May 1, 2011. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal will contain a mandatory qualification criterion which restricts the facility to be located within the continental United States to accommodate the requirements for shipping of biological specimens to and from the facility. This acquisition is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712, Size Standard - 500 employees.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation, NHLBI-HB-11-19 will be available electronically on or about March 31, 2010 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following URL location: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the National Heart Lung and Blood posting section.  No paper copies will be available.  Proposals will be due on or about May 27, 2010.

<DESC>Please note the below has been modified.  The synopsis initially mistakenly stated that the Government intends to award this effort as a sole source delivery order to the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office; the below revised synopsis now correctly states that the Government intends to award this on a sole-source basis to Triumph Gear Systems, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the Pylon Conversion Actuator (PCA).


NAVAIR NAWCAD Lakehurst intends to enter into a sole source delivery order with Triumph Gear Systems (TGS) for the procurement of the design, development, manufacture, and testing of one (1) V-22 Pylon Conversion Actuator (PCA) Test Stand with one (1) associated Hydraulic Test Program Set (HTPS). This test stand will be used at Depot Level of maintenance to test, fault isolate, and re-qualify the PCA as being Ready For Issue (RFI) into the fleet.  Also included in this acquisition is a quantity of two (2) Backup Hydraulic Power Drive Units needed to support Depot testing, along with associated Technical Data.  The Navy does not own specifications, drawings, and related data to permit full and open competition.  TGS is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the V-22 Pylon Conversion Actuator and remains the only business entity that has all the required proprietary rights and non disclosure agreements with the suppliers of the aircraft components that are necessary to design, develop, and manufacture this V-22 Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE).  The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice that the Government is canceling the subject procurement.
<p>The Government has determined that the requirements solicited were inadequate and flawed and therefore the specifications need to be revised. Amending the solicitation was determined to not be in the best interest of the Government as the Statement of Work requires significant changes, which might result in excluding additional responsible small businesses.</p>
<p>The Government does intend to reissue the revised and re-scoped requirements on or around June 15, 2010. All Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals for the revised solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Question and Answer regarding this Special Notice posting: Vendors are requested to hold all questions until the combined synopsis/solicitation is issued.
<p><strong>**Additional questions received in response to this Special Notice will not be answered.**</strong></p>
<p>Q: Is this project considered a new requirement?<br /><br />A: There currently no contract in place for combatives instruction services. NSWCEN has purchased services for combatives instruction in the past, so the type of instruction is not a new requirement in that sense. The combined synopsis/solicitation that is pending will have revised requirements from any previous contract.<br /><br />NSWCEN had posted two solicitations with the intent to contract for combatives services; however both solicitations had to be cancelled due to considerable changes in the requirements of the Government that rendered these two solicitations invalid. Solicitation H92240-09-R-GN47 was cancelled in its entirety in AUG 2009. Solicitation H92240-10-R-0008 is pending official cancellation; notice will be posted by the Government regarding this cancellation.<br /><br />In both of these cancelled solicitations the Government identified the incumbent as Dieter's Close Quarters Defense, Inc.</p>

<DESC>VA118-10-RP-0124Questions and Answers March 17, 2010REFERENCE: Section 3 of the PWS indicates the claimants will be able to electronically download a machine readable claims form and "at their option, electronically submit" the completed claims form. QUESTION #1: For those claimants, who choose not to electronically submit their claims form, is the expectation that these non-electronically submitted forms will be manually entered into the system or that they will be electronically scanned into the system?ANSWER #1. The Contractor will develop a machine-readable claims form that enables claimants to electronically download and, at their option, electronically submit complete claims for service connection which provides medical evidence detailed in Attachments A, B, and C. VA anticipates that the new claims form will be both shorter than the current form, and will be well suited to an automated processing method. For this special program, VA will accept only claims utilizing this automated machine readable form. Given the data shall be on the "machine readable" form, the completed claim forms that are not electronically submitted, shall be scanned. REFERENCE: The hyperlink provided in Addendum A Section 2 http://vaww.eas.vaco.va.gov/OneVAEA/ for One-VA Enterprise Architecture (EA) does not appear to be accessible outside of the VA network.  QUESTION #2: Could the Government please provide an alternative mechanism to access this information? ANSWER #2: The following link goes to VA's Internet EA site (instead of its "Intranet site"): http://www.ea.oit.va.gov/index.asp.

A total of 8 samples will be collected from 8 stations within the shoaled areas in the Red Run Drain.  Sampling will be coordinated to avoid spring run off time and high rain events to minimize the water depth in the drain.  The depth of the water in the drain at the sampling areas are reported to be less than 2 feet; therefore a boat is not anticipated for the sampling.  A drain easement is present along the entire drain length allowing easy access via a vehicle to the sampling locations.

<DESC>In Scope Change Order for Repair and Refurbish of Cheatham Dam Intake Gates.<BR>The work shall consist of performing surface preparation on the lower third portion of gate one. The bottom third of gate one was responding differently to surface preparation and needed to be evaluated for a possible deviation to the original contract specifications. When blisters present on the surface of the gate were ruptured, the blisters revealed a black coating on the surface of the gate and the backside of the removed paint film. Further examination of the removed film confirmed the black coating not to be mil scale but an unknown coating releasing from the gate causing blisters on just the bottom portion of gate one. The Contractor shall use agents of a caustic blend to remove the existing paint. The Contractor shall remove 100% of the existing coating system from that third of gate one. The Contractor shall get approval from the Contracting Officer's representative that the existing paint surface has been thoroughly removed prior to applying any new paint.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA4814-10-C-0008
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
<p>6th Civil Engineering Squadron, MacDill Air Force Base (Tampa) Fl 33621 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA4814-07-D-0001 which expires on 31 Mar 2010. The bridge contract will consist of 1 one-month basic period of performance with 4 one-month options. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Chugach Management Services, Inc. (CMSI), 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Ste 601, Anchorage, AK 99503. Interested parties may e-mail shon.johnson@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-1091, Attn: Shon Johnson, not later than Tuesday, 24 March 2010, 2:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-15(ii) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />CMSI is the only company with the personnel, tools, equipment, vehicles, and materiel mobilized to perform these services which are essential/mission critical to MacDill AFB, tenant units and the base population without a lapse in service or a duplication of significant capital investment (Vehicles/equipment $7,205,144.00, includes cost of money) and start-up (transition-in, $130,000.00) costs. Any contractor except CMSI would, of necessity, experience investment or start-up costs for this large operation, and the government would not recover such costs through competition of the bridge contract simply because of the extremely short contract term.</p>
<p>As the incumbent for the past ten years, CMSI is the only contractor who is fully knowledgeable of the requirements and level of effort required to meet the needs of the base population to sustain the level of service required and ensure no Notice of Violations are received for failure to meet all federal and state regulations and requirements. This is important because MacDill Air Force Base has to provide a safe, secure, healthy and supportive environment to the MacDill tenant units, and residents, while supporting the War Fighter, without any interruption of critical infrastructure services.</p>
<p>Changeover from the current contract with CMSI to a bridge contract with CMSI will be transparent to MacDill in terms contractor performance. Award of the bridge contract to another contractor will not produce seamless performance. The result would be degraded or interrupted services which MacDill AFB cannot absorb and still meet its peacetime and wartime missions.<br /><br />In summary, several contractors can perform these services on a long-term basis as the recent source selection indicates; however, there is only one contractor (CMSI) who is capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<DESC>The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service is planning a sole-source purchase order with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. The Fusion 5,1 and ECi Chemistry Analyzers have capabilities and features that no other current chemistry analyzer is able to provide. The instruments have multiple built-in functions and low maintenance procedures which require minimum hands on time resulting in a cost savings in tech time. The instrument's test menu also allows for the service unit to run more tests in-house for additional cost savings. These are highly complex electronic instruments listing up to $180,000.<br /><br />
<p>Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics can supply a service agreement that provides complete maintenance, labor, travels and parts five (5) days per week. Also included are scheduled preventative maintenance visits, software updates and telephone technical support. The service contract represents approximately 12% of the analyzers initial cost. This percentage is utilized in part to calculate the service agreement price. Instrument repairs and service without the contract can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars per visit for parts, travel, and labor using flat fee rates. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics is the only vendor with trained service engineers that can provide this full service.</p>
<p>The Winnebago Indian Health Service is responsible to ensure the Indian Health Hospital located on the Winnebago reservation is providing the services required by the government and utilizing the federal appropriations in accordance to regulations which govern the Indian Health Service.<br /><br />This announcement is a sole-source set-aside, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.
