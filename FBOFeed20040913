<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Cangene Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only responsible source and 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.
A contract was awarded,to Cangene Corporation in January 2003, as a result of a competitive procurement for the production of botulinum antitoxin.  To date the contractor has developed Assays and conducted the necessary Pilot Runs (4).  As a direct result of the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy and the increase in the threat of bioterrorist activities against the United States (U.S.), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a need to contract for additional botulinum antitoxin in addition to the botulinum antitoxin that will be produced under the contract described above.  The DHHS and CDC has a need to contract with an experienced firm that possesses the capability and capacity for the production, licensure, and delivery of up to 200,000 doses of Despeciated Heptavalent Botulinum Immune Globulin (BIG) for use as a Heptavalent investigational product under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and to develop a strategy to license the product that is produced. The contactor will also be responsible for monitoring the potency of the BIG product for an extended period of time.
At the time of award, the prospective contractor must possess the necessary capability and capacity for cGMP production and licensure and all FDA validation production requirements.  The FDA has now determined that both sets of plasma (the January 2003 Cangene contract and the resulting contract for an additional 200,000 doses as decribed above) can go under one license.

Past performance is significantly more important than cost or price.  The Government may make award without discussions - therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain offeror's best pricing.   Tradeoff Process:  It may be in the Government's best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror. This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal if the perceived benefits of the highest priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.;

       (a) This contract is not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C.601-613).
       (b) All disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.  For contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
       (f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractor’s receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractor’s appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.  
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having a defective certification, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim.  Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
       (i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors' (BBG) Office of Contracts (M/CON) has a requirement for a contractor to pack, ship, and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated electrical equipment and other hazardous waste materials located at two separate U.S. Government facilities.  One facility is located in the Philippines and the second facility is located in Thailand.  The BBG presently intends to issue separate solicitation documents [Requests for Proposal (RFP)] for each location and to award separate contracts for the proposed work at each location, unless it is determined by the BBG at some later date that it would be to the Government's significant advantage to combine the work for the two locations into a single contract.  At the Philippines Transmitting Station (PTS) site, the waste consists of PCB contaminated transformers, capacitors, electronic vacuum tubes containing beryllium, paint (in cans) containing lead, material containing cyanide, and fluorescent light tubes containing mercury.  The estimated price-range to remediate the Philippines site of the above-stated hazardous waste materials is between $100,000 and $250,000.  At the Thailand Transmitting Station (TTS) site, the waste consists of PCB contaminated transformers only.  The estimated price-range to remediate the Thailand site of the PCB contaminated transformers is between $100,000 and $250,000.  All hazardous materials involved in this project are of United States of America manufacture, are currently U.S. Government property, and have been U. S. Government property since their initial shipment from the United States to the PTS and TTS locations.  All of the hazardous waste materials may be repatriated back to the United States.  The estimated period of performance for each contract is approximately 8-10 months after contract award.  Offerors responding to this Public Notice shall be required to submit both a Technical Proposal and a Firm-Fixed-Price Proposal (on a U.S. dollar per unit basis, based on estimated quantities of each hazardous waste material as listed in the RFP).  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.304(e), Offerors are hereby notified that the BBG's basis for each of these separate contract awards is: 1) total Firm-Fixed-Price; and 2) multiple technical factors, with the set of technical factors, when combined, being weighted higher than the Offeror's proposed total price for each separate location.  Furthermore, any Offeror who takes any exceptions to any of the provisions, terms, or conditions of either of the forthcoming solicitation (RFP) documents, is subject to automatically being determined by the BBG as being non-responsive to the Government's stated requirements, and therefore no longer being under any further consideration by the BBG for either or both of these separate procurements.  The following four (4) technical factors (each factor is equally weighted) will be evaluated by the BBG to determine each Offeror's total technical score: (a) agreement to comply with and/or to properly perform the general and special provisions of each separate contract; (b) acceptability to the Government of the Offeror's proposed performance schedule for each separate contract; (c) extent and quality of the Offeror's prior experience in performing the same type of hazardous waste collection and disposal work; and (d) the Offeror's experience in performing similar hazardous waste site remediation work in overseas environments similar to the PTS and TTS locations of this proposed contract work.  The BBG intends to issue separate solicitation documents [Requests for Proposal (RFP)] for each negotiated firm-fixed-price procurement for each separate location in October 2004, with a proposal response date of thirty (30) calendar days after the BBG's issuance of each separate RFP document for the respective PTS and TTS locations.  Offerors who are interested in receiving a copy of one or both of the separate RFPs must submit their request for such receipt in writing to the BBG Contracting Officer, Mr. Gary Hosford, M/CON/CR, via facsimile at (202) 260-0855; or E-mail message at ghosford@IBB.gov; or via letter to the above-listed address by not later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the GSA's posting date at their website of this Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) for Vendors Public Notice.  Please reference solicitation (RFP) No. DKL-FY05-63 when requesting the solicitation for the Philippines, solicitation No. DKL-FY-05-66 when requesting the solicitation for Thailand, and on all other correspondence regarding this Public Notice.  All written requests for copies of either the PTS and/or the TTS RFP documents must include the Offeror's company name, mailing address, working telephone and facsimile numbers of  the Offeror's by-name and job-title point-of-contact for this proposed procurement.  No telephone requests for this RFP will be accepted by the BBG.  All responsible sources may submit Technical and Price proposals for each or both of these separate procurements in response to the forthcoming separate solicitation (RFP) documents, and all such proposals shall be considered by the BBG.  This FBO Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for noncommercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N00167-04-Q-0543 applies and issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The small business set-aside has been dissolved. The proposed contract is being solicited on a sole-source basis to BMA Engineering Inc; Potomac , MD. 20854. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Dr. Bilal Ayyub of BMA Engineering, Inc. is uniquely qualified to conduct this work as he is a leading researcher in the area of Risk Methodology. Rese! arch that he has conducted over the past few years has provided a new understanding of risk with application to naval ship design.

<DESC>A - BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT:  NAVAL AIR VEHICLE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY - *BAA NO. 04-00.  POC, Naval Air Systems Command, Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, (AIR 4.4T), 22195 Elmer Road, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534 .
Broad Agency Announcement: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T) is interested in receiving proposals for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles.  Specifically needed is research for advanced gas turbine propulsion component and materials technologies for Fighter/Attack Aircraft Engines, Patrol/Surveillence and Rotary Wing Aircraft Engines, Missile and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Uninhabited Combat Air vehicles (UCAV) Engines. The performance, life, and cost goals for these research efforts shall be consistent with the DOD/NASA Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) Initiative and Versatile Advanced Affordable Turbine Engines (VAATE) Initiative, and the Tri-Service Reliance Science & Technology Joint Service Program Plans. This includes Aircraft Noise and Emissions Reduction Technologies. Other topics include development of Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Navy propulsion component and subsystem technologies applicable to fleet engines and near term upgrades/derivative engines which reduce fuel consumption; development of Advanced Electrical Power and Thermal Management technologies; development of Shipboard/Field Fuel Quality Detectors, Filtration Technology to Remove Copper from Fuel, and Impact Studies of JP-5 as the Single Naval Fuel at Sea.

Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication “Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Year 2005”. The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at:  www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored.

Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D) (2). 

 This announcement will be open for one year after it appears in the Fed Biz Opp’s and Commerce Business Daily. Initial Proposals and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. Initial proposals (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism.  No further criteria will be used in the evaluation.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds.  Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated.   Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Since many aspects of the IHPTET/VAATE initiative are classified, the offerors and their personnel may need to possess security clearances up to and including the secret level for contracts associated with IHPTET/VAATE, contemplated under this announcement.  Specific reporting  requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award.   At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report.  Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals (IPs) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate.  BRIEFNESS IS DESIBRABLE - IPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.  Cost estimates in IPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged.  Offerors of those IPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.  An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award.  One original and three copies of each IP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted.  IPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: a)  Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534 and b) Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 2.5.1.4.4.2, Bldg 411,  29183 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regards to this requirement.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Dis-Advantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,  women-owned small business and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.

<DESC>The purpose of this initiative is to support the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in its mission to treat, and prevent the infectious diseases caused by two different hepatitis viruses, hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV).  Chronic infections by either virus affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and may lead to life-threatening conditions like cirrhosis and cancer.  Currently licensed therapies against either virus fall short of being curative, may have adverse side effects, and are further complicated by the development of resistant strains or coinfections with other viruses, such as HIV.  New safer and more effective therapies are needed to prevent the end stage liver diseases that cause one million hepatitis-related deaths a year. Appropriate animal models are needed to test them.

Animal Models to Evaluate New Therapeutic Candidates for HBV and/or HCV. Small mammalian animal models (e.g.: mice, rats, small primates such as tamarins, tupaias, or marmosets, etc.) of HBV or HCV infection and disease are sought to evaluate new therapeutic candidates (drugs, immunomodulators, therapeutic vaccines, etc.) that may reduce or eliminate viral replication or prevent progression of liver disease.  Results from testing a therapeutic in the animal model should predict human responses.   Important considerations for selecting a model include the guaranteed provision of ample numbers of animals, and the availability of well-documented tools and assays for analysis of outcomes. As dose requirements are based usually on body weight, lighter is better.  Endangered mammals or mammals over five (5) kilograms are excluded.   All proposals submitted in response to this RFP must include one or more small animal models capable of evaluating therapeutic candidates against either hepatitis B or hepatitis C.  

Animal Models to Evaluate Protective Vaccine Candidates for HCV.  Small mammalian animal models are also sought to evaluate protective vaccine candidates for HCV.  Proposals submitted in response to this RFP for HCV may propose to include one or more small animal models capable of evaluating protective vaccine candidates against HCV in addition to animal models for evaluating HCV therapeutic candidates.  The same or different animal models may be proposed for the evaluation of HCV therapeutic candidates and protective vaccine candidates.

The long-standing woodchuck animal model will not be supported under this RFP. Work on this animal model will be continued through a separate mechanism concurrent with contracts awarded under this RFP.  It is anticipated that two to four cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 1, 2005.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-05-12 will be available electronically on or about September 29, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/cgi-shl/cmb/rfps.cfm. Please note that the RFP for this acquisition only includes the work statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements, the technical evaluation criteria, and the proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, Offerors comprising the competitive range will be asked to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer. Responses to this RFP will be due approximately January 5, 2005.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  Point of contact: Yvette Brown, Contract Specialist at ybrown@niaid.nih.gov, telephone: (301) 451-3686, FAX: (301) 480-4675, you may also contact Paul McFarlane, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-0349, email pm24@nih.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH, on a sole source basis with Dr. Matthew Eick of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University for a study entitled "Characterization and Pressure Jump Relaxation Kinetics of Arsenic Sorption on Ruthenium Dioxide (RuO2)." The contractor shall monitor the kinetic performance of RuO2 as a high-capacity sorbent of arsenic via pressure jump relaxation methodology.  The metal of interest for this project is arsenic (As).  Supplementary research  characterizing the RuO2 surface will be conducted as well as modeling of the collected data and deciphered into peer-reviewed publications.   The true kinetic rates of adsorption for metals on RuO2 are not known.  The hypothesis of this task is that the application of pressure jump relaxation  kinetic studies will yield vital information regarding cation sorption on ruthenium oxide.  The contractor shall gather and analyze data from pressure jump relaxation kinetic to evaluate the effectiveness of As sorption on RuO2 and characterize the RuO2 solid to understand the chemical and physical  properties of the ruthenium oxide surface. The contractor shall conduct experiments and collect data regarding the pressure jump relaxation kinetics of arsenite and arsenate sorption on RuO2 to provide information on the initial reaction rate of As sorption and provide evidence on possible  sorption mechanisms from RuO2 characterization.  Further, a full characterization of the RuO2 material (chemical and physical) will be determined to gain understanding into the high sorbing capacity of the substance. Data collected shall be cataloged along these lines: 1.	Chemical and physical  characterization of RuO2 via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), reactive functional groups and acidity analysis, dissolution behavior, electron microscopy imaging, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface potential measurements.   2.	Pressure jump  relaxation kinetic studies of As(III) and As(V) on RuO2 as a function of pH under constant ionic strength and temperature (minimum of 3 pH values). 3.	Pressure jump relaxation kinetic studies of As(III) and As(V) on RuO2 as a function of ionic strength (I) under constant pH and temperature (minimum  of 2 ionic concentrations - suggested 0.001 and 0.1 M). 4.	Pressure jump relaxation kinetic studies of As(III) and As(V) on RuO2 as a function of temperature under constant pH and ionic strength (minimum of 3 temperature values to fulfill minimum requirements for Arrhenius and Eyring  Equations). The contractor shall prepare at least two peer-reviewed technical journal articles which describes the entire study, displays pertinent data and defends conclusions drawn. This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates Dr. Eick is the only known source able  to satisfy the government's requirements. No other known source has the knowledge of pressure jump relaxation spectrometric analyses, nor the equipment needed to complete the study.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to  establish the potential of fulfilling the government's requirements. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before  Wednesday September 28, 2004 at 12:00 PM EST).   A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13,  Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710. Interested parties should submit their technical documentation, referencing RFQ-OH-04-00182, to Mr. Josh Bowers, preferably via email at bowers.joshua@epa.gov. Technical documentation may also be submitted as follows: via  regular mail: U.S. EPA, Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, or via Express Mail/Hand Carry:  U.S. EPA, 4411 Montgomery Road, Suite 300, Norwood, OH 45212.

<ARCHDATE>10132004
<CONTACT>Capt Richard Marsh, Contracting Officer, Phone (719) 556-2795, Email richard.marsh@cisf.af.mil
<DESC>This proposed contract action is being synopsized in accordance with Numbered Note 22 due to the likelihood that award to any other source than the incumbent would result in unacceptable delays in the fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The Space and Missile System Center, Detachment 11/PK, 1050 E. Stewart Ave., Peterson Air Force Base, CO 80914-2902 will be awarding a sole-source Letter Contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Integrated Systems & Solutions, 3201 Jermantown Road, Fairfax, VA 22030 no later than 30 Sep 04.  The period of performance for this effort will consist of a base of one year plus two six month options.  The MARK IVB System is a meteorological data ingest, processing and dissemination system.  Meteorological data is obtained (i.e., ingested) from U.S. domestic (i.e., Department of Commerce) and foreign meteorological satellites, both polar orbiting and geostationary.  Once processed by the MARK IVB, this data is made available to analysts and forecasters located worldwide.  The software used by the analysts and forecasters is MARKIVB software–it is fully system integrated with the MARK IVB ingest sites.  The data ingest is useless without the analysis software.  With analysis software it becomes useful and useable information.  The MARK IVB systems are installed in six operational locations worldwide.  Operating sites are located at Hickam AFB, Hawaii, Kadena AB, Japan, Andersen AB, Guam, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, Lajes AB, Azores and Sembach AB, Germany.  While the MARK IVB was originally designed as a stand-alone, self-contained meteorological ingest and processing system, where analysis and forecasting was accomplished on site, it has evolved into a network-centric enterprise system where analysis and forecasting is accomplished off site.  As a key component of the Joint METSAT Imagery Software and Terminals (JMIST) system, the MARK IVB provides high-resolution METSAT data to authorized users worldwide on a near-real time, 24/7 basis.  The remote users employ one of two MARK IVB software applications (Generic Imagery Dissemination System and PC Forecaster) and network connections to access, download, display and manipulate the MARK IVB meteorological data.  The MARK IVB server software operates in a real time UNIX environment.  The maintainer and client software applications operate in the Windows XP environment.  The meteorological data is first ingested and processed by the RF segment of the MARK IVB, it is then sent to the data server where it is reformatted into a MARK IVB unique format and mounted on the data server for dissemination to authorized users.  The maintainer application contains a variety of system configuration, satellite ingest scheduling, maintenance and analytical tools.  A future upgrade to the system will replace the Unix server with a Windows server, making the entire MARK IVB Windows-based.  The MARK IVB automatically collects Geostationary and Polar meteorological data directly from satellites without reliance on other means of communications.  The data streams consist of visual and infrared imagery and mission sensor data.  The MARK IVB also has the capability to generate satellite pass schedules, error messages and log status and audit events.   The vast majority of the MARK IVB system is comprised of Commercial Off-the-Shelf hardware and government-owned software and must be continually upgraded to meet evolving mission requirements due to new satellite launches and forecasting techniques, and to avoid technical obsolescence.  The majority of the MARK IVB sustainment effort is software maintenance, with about a 90%/10% split between software and hardware sustainment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested companies with the capability to perform in support of this requirement are encouraged to participate and contact Lockheed Martin.  The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS 541710.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Verbal responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Peter Santangelo, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2005
<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806 has a requirement for a reliable, durable XM26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System  (MASS).  The MASS will securely attach to a primary weapon, to include the  M16A2 Rifle, M16A4 Rifle, M4 Carbine, M4A1 Carbine, and the Modular Weapon  System (MWS) equipped M16A4 Rifles and M4 Carbines with the potential for  attachment to future rifles and carbines and utilize the primary weapon  sighting system.  The MASS shall be capable of being removed or attached to the primary weapon without the use of tools and utilizing a quick-disconnect  feature while maintaining bore alignment with the primary weapon’s sights. The  Army requires the MASS to be used as a stand alone shotgun with a sighting  system and an integrated or attachable MIL-STD-1913 rail to attach various  ancillary devices.  This 12-gauge shotgun will provide the user with door  breaching, lethal, and non-lethal capability during close quarter combat  operations.  The MASS must be a lightweight and an easily maintained weapon  capable of operating reliably in all climatic environments.  The MASS will be  manually or semi-automatically operated and capable of firing all current U.S.  Army standard 12 Gauge Ammunition, to include the 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch Magnum  00 Buckshot, 2 3/4 inch slug round, the M1012 and M1013 Non Lethal round, and  the M1030 Breaching Round.  The MASS will permit the quick transition from non  lethal to lethal rounds.  The MASS will permit door breaching and shot shell  employment while maintaining primary weapon control.  The MASS will enable  increased Soldier mobility over the current systems (Mossberg M500 and M16  Rifle/M4 Carbine).  The MASS requirement will be met with a base contract of  fifty (50) systems for developmental testing to be procured in FY05.  There  will be options for up to 5,000 systems per year for 6 years.  The contractor  must be able to sustain a delivery schedule of 200 systems per month with a  possible increase of as much as 400 systems per month beginning sixty (60) days  from the successful completion of First Article Testing.  The offeror shall  submit six (6) bid samples, in addition to the written technical proposals,  each with the necessary mounting hardware for the various primary weapons,  stand-alone conversion kit, sighting accessories, slings, a minimum of five (5)  magazines with any appropriate speed loaders (when applicable), a 12 gauge  cleaning kit, and commercial operator’s and maintenance manuals in the  offeror’s format.  The winning offeror must be able to deliver the 50 systems  NLT 75 days from the date of award for safety certification, Developmental  Testing, and Operational Testing.

<SOLNBR>CUSTOMERPAY
<RESPDATE>101204
<ARCHDATE>12112004
<CONTACT>Greg Jablonski, 586 753-2558
<DESC>CUSTOMER PAY SOURCES SOUGHT MARKET SURVEY  1.	The U. S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), Warren, Michigan, invites your comments and responses to the below Market Survey Questionnaire.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not a commitment by TA COM.  If sufficient interest is shown and a significant overall program savings can be realized for the Department of Defense a competitive solicitation may be issued.  2.	Our goal is to determine contractor interest in a CUSTOMER PAY * contract in which the contractor will supply spare/repair parts to the ongoing High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)  Recapitalization (RECAP) Program at Red River Army Depot (RRAD), Texarkana TX.  The HMMWV RECAP program receives M998 configuration HMMWVs from field units, disassembles, replaces targeted parts and components, remanufactures others and rebuilds the vehicle to an M1097 configuration.  The vehicle is at that poin t a zero miles, zero hours platform ready for issue to tactical formations.  The spare/repair parts are to support the RECAP line; major assemblies such as engines and transmissions are not included.  It is anticipated that the start date will be October 2 005 and run for one year (FY06).  The Government anticipates funding to be available for the completion of between 660 and 3,600 HMMWVs during FY 2006.  An option for an additional year (FY07) may be included, if the Government determines approximate requi rements before issuance of the solicitation.   * CUSTOMER PAY is a DoD initiative to optimize the supply chain by having DoD pay for materiel only when delivered for point of consumption use to the end user.  The objective is to move the point of inspection and point of sale to the point of use.  The c oncept involves the Contractor owning, managing, and delivering inventory to the customer.  The billing and payment cycle begins at the time of use by (or delivery to) the customer.  3.	RRAD currently uses the Government managed supply system to obtain parts for the HMMWV RECAP program.  RRAD currently pays an average $20,904.65 per vehicle for parts obtained through the Government supply system.  The Government is restrictive in our f unding profile.  The program cost threshold therefore will not allow the Government to consider any higher offer.   4.  Contractor: a.  The contractor will be required to manage and operate the supply chain/parts inventory to provide, on a just in time basis, in kit form, all parts used by the RRAD HMMWV Recap line, and ensure that the production lines are not delayed due to stock ou ts.  b.  A stock out is defined as a situation where a HMMWV component part required by the line process is unavailable for any HMMWV in the program.  c.  The contractor will not be allowed to request payment for an item until that item has been delivered to the production line for consumption within the work centers cycle time.  The last work day of each month, the contractor will submit an invoice for  that months delivered parts. d.  No Government financing provisions, such as Progress Payments, will be provided for this program.  e.  The contractor will be required to supply component parts in accordance with Government provided technical data packages. In the event of any change in a part(s) resulting from any Engineering Change Proposal or Notice of Revision (NOR), the contractor  will be responsible to provide the upgraded part(s) as changed and in accordance with the established production lead time and/or production cut-in, and will not be reimbursed the cost of the obsolete part(s).  It is anticipated that there will be several  changes throughout the year of execution all geared to providing an increasingly more capable system to the combatant commander.  f.  The parts will remain the property of the contractor until they are delivered to the production line for consumption within the given work center s cycle time.  Any parts not delivered to the production line will not be paid for by the Government, including parts not used due to changes in requirements and technical revisions.  g.  The Government estimates that of the approximately 1,310 HMMWV component part NSNs potentially required per HMMWV, roughly 400 of them are mandatory replacement parts.  A table of the HMMWV component part NSNs, nomenclatures, quantities per HMMWV, and a Government-determined designation of those items which are mandatory for replacement in HMMWVs, is attached as an Excel file Customer Pay Parts List for RRAD HMMWV RECAP.xls.  The Government reserves the right to change the part listing and/or producti on schedule as necessary.   5.	Any resultant contract will require that the contractor implement methods and controls such that the RRAD HMMWV program, beginning in Oct 2005, will experience zero (0) stock outs of any of the approximately 1,310 HMMWV component part numbers.   6.	Any resultant contract will prohibit the Contractor from providing new, unused, former U.S. Government surplus material without Government approval.  The Contractor will not be excused from the zero (0) stock out requirement while the Government conside rs any requests concerning new, unused, former U.S. Government surplus material. 7.	A Pre-proposal Conference will be planned after the evaluation of the results of this Market Survey is complete provided that sufficient contractor interest is generated.  Contractors are invited to visit TACOMs Major Systems  Web Page at TACOM-Warren Electronic Contracting . Based on the above information, interested sources should provide the following: 1.	General Information: a.	Company Name: b.	Address: c.	Company telephone number d.	Company web site: 2.	Individual completing this questionnaire: a.	Name: b.	Title/Position: c.	Telephone Number: d.

(See FAR 19  Small Business Programs).  4.	Does your company have the financial resources to successfully perform on a contract generated as a result of the above Sources Sought Market Survey, including sufficient resources that allow for payment not to be received until after the part is used, or in the case of obsolescence, never reimbursed? 5.	Does your company have prior experience on similar type projects, either in house experience or previous contracts in which you have coordinated and supplied production lines.  At a minimum please detail the following: a.	Quantity of parts managed to support the production line: b.	Quantity of stock outs that occurred during management of production line. c.	Were you the prime contractor or a subcontractor? d.	Please provide the time frame and length of project for which you performed the above 6.

For example, if any of the above described terms would preclude your submitting an Offer, identify those terms and how they might be modified to enable your Offer.   8.	Can your company perform in accordance with the terms set forth in the Market Survey for less than the cost threshold detailed above?  If not, what would be a more realistic estimate? 9.   Please feel free to add any additional comments. 10.  Responses to this market survey should be sent, no later than 12 Oct 04,        by email to : jablonsg@tacom.army.m il        or by fax to (586) 574-7510, for the attention of Greg Jablonski       or by mail to:       U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command       AMSTA-AQ-ATAC, ATTN: Greg Jablonski       6501 East Eleven Mile Road, Warren, MI 48397-5000

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive contract to the Gallup Organization to conduct the Gallup Q12® Management System Survey.  The Gallup Q12® Management System is a copyrighted survey process conducted only by the Gallup Organization.  No other source exists that is able to conduct the Q12® survey and analyze its results.  The FDA Management Council voted to conduct an Agency-wide survey in FY 2005 to assess employee engagement.  The FDA Management Council concluded that the same survey, the Gallup Q12® Management System Survey, that was proven successful in the Office of the Commissioner in September 2003, and previously in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, should be implemented Agency-wide.  The Gallup Organization has a proven record of accomplishment in the Agency.  The Gallup Q12® Management System provides everyone in the organization – executives, managers, coaches, and associates – with the information, tools, and coaching required for creating and sustaining a more engaged and productive culture.  Each stage of the Gallup system encompasses ongoing consulting, measurement, and education that work in concert to drive positive outcomes.  Gallup’s 12 questions (Q12®) measure employee engagement and link powerfully to relevant business outcomes, including retention, productivity, profitability, customer engagement and safety.  Research shows that engaged employees, those who want meaningful work, a good manager, and the chance to work and grow using their unique strengths, are more productive, more committed and more likely to stay.  The focus of the process is on identifying strengths that can be leveraged to improve productivity and employee engagement.  This initiative supports the [Acting] Commissioner’s objective of building a Strong FDA.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Naval Air Systems Command.  The Navy E-6B Program Office is seeking sources interested in providing depot-level support of the CFM56-2A-2 engine for the E-6B TACAMO program.  The CFM56-2A-2 is a General Electric/SNECMA (CFM International) commercial engine.  The E-6B has four CFM56-2A-2 engines on each of the 16 aircraft used by the U.S. Navy to provide survivable, reliable, and endurable airborne command, control, and communication between the National Command Authority (NCA) and U.S. Strategic and non-Strategic forces.  The proposed procurement of a base year and four one-year options from FY06 through FY10 will use a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) approach.  The contractor will provide complete depot-level engine maintenance to support the needs of the entire E-6B fleet, including spares (75 engines) and total integrated logistics support including the provision of all spare engines, asset repair management (spares and consumables), obsolescence management, reliability and maintainability management , configuration management, commercial technology insertion, transportation, sustaining engineering (SE) and any other innovative supply support solutions plus the labor necessary for such maintenance.  The anticipated unscheduled maintenance workload is four engines per year for the life of the contract.  This is subject to change as forecasting for unscheduled maintenance is based on historical data.  Based on current flight hour projections, it is also anticipated that the additional scheduled maintenance workload will be two engines in FY08, seven  engines in FY09 and five  engines in FY10.    

This PBL must comply with 10 U.S.C. ¡± 2474 ¡§Centers of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE),¡¨ which authorizes and encourages the head of the CITE to enter into a Public-Private Partnership.  It is anticipated that this will be accomplished through an agreement between the successful offeror and the current organic depot, OC-ALC which is located at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, OK.  It is anticipated that the contractor will be responsible for maintaining and controlling the current inventory of engines, modules, and spare and repair parts, and any additional engines that are required by the fleet.  The contractor will be accountable for maintaining the entire inventory throughout the duration of the contract.

The contractor will be held to the following availability metrics in the contract:

„h	Engine Availability
o	24 hours delivery to STRATCOMWINGONE, Tinker AFB with required SE
o	Four War Reserve engines available to STRATCOMMWINGONE at all times
„h	Turn Around Time
o	24 hours for War Reserve engine replacement

DCCW, the Office of the Adjutant General (TAG) Army Continuing Education Sys tem (ACES) and Personnel Information Systems Directorate (PERSINSD).  PERSINSD is in the process of identifying the requirements to re-compete the existing eArmyU contract and initiate the development of an Army virtual education capability.   This Request for Information (RFI) is to support market research being conducted by the Army to identify capable sources and innovative solutions.  The eArmyU Program Management Office is seeking information and insight from experienced sources to support the continuation of eArmyU capabilities and the development of an Army virtual education capability. The estimated period of performance for this acquisition will be base year plus 4 option years, starting in the Jul-Sep 2005 timeframe.  The current eArmyU  contract will expire in December 2005.  This is a sources sought notice.   Responses to this request should be submitted to Mary Young, no later than September 24, 2004 at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP).  At this time, neither the SOW nor a solicitation is available.  Potential sources are requested to provide a capability statement that describes their experience providing services of the same or similar nature.   Responses should be complete, answer all questions , and address all potential tasks. The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation as all or none.  Tasks may not be broken out.  Small businesses are strongly encouraged to respond.   Questions should be emailed to:  Jacquelyn.Harris@hqda.army.mil. eArmyU is an Army education initiative, which offers eligible soldiers online courses leading to certificates and postsecondary degrees recognized by a majority of U.S. educational institutions.  eArmyU is currently available to 50,000 soldiers at 16 insta llations worldwide offering 146 degree programs from 29 regionally accredited colleges and universities and enables a soldier to get a degree online.  The eArmyU Program Office will begin the implementation of eArmyU Army-wide beginning October 1, 2004.   The eArmyU program features include the eArmyU portal (eArmyU.com), 100 percent tuition assistance, books and fees (up to the DoD established FY per semester hour cap and annual tuition ceiling), academic tutoring, program mentoring, 24 x 7 helpdesk, Galil eo library services and the option to receive a technology package (laptop, carrying case, maintenance and warranty, and an Internet Service Provider (ISP) account) for soldiers.  Beginning Fiscal Year 2005, enrollment in eArmyU with an Army-issued laptop will be refocused to support retention and readiness.  Only active duty enlisted soldiers who agree to reenlist for duty into combat forces/operational units as defined by senior Army leadership, subject to adjustments, will be eligible to receive an Army- issued laptop.  The technology and academic support provided to soldiers is continuous and seamless beginning with enrollment in eArmyU and includes transfer to other installations.  Online support (e.g., academic tutoring, mentoring, virtual counseling, e lectronic library resources, and helpdesk services) is available throughout the soldiers' involvement in the program.   In order to maximize credit for military skills and experience, and to ensure that soldiers can transfer education credits across institutions, only Service members Opportunity Colleges Army Degree (SOCAD) member schools may offer undergraduate programs as  part of eArmyU.  Non-SOCAD institutions offering only graduate and/or certificate programs must agree in writing to the SOC institutional principles and criteria.  Both horizontal (associate to associate) and vertical (associate to bachelor's) transfer of  academic credit between 2- and 4-year member institutions have been built into eArmyU to provide soldiers the opportunity to advance in their degree options. The current contract integrator provides the following services: coordination of universities offering degree programs, operations and maintenance of eArmyU Portal (including compliance with Army security requirements), single sign-on capability with onlin e registration and access to courses through the Portal, access and coordination of courses through streamlined adoption of a course management system, issuance and timely repair of laptops, issuance of Internet Service Provider (ISP) and email accounts, i ssuance of books, student services (e.g., program mentors, tutorial services, online writing lab, digital library), eArmyU Common Application that is accepted by all institutions, on-line, fully searchable course catalog, 24x7 help desk with a Customer Rel ationship Management (CRM)/Student Status tool, development and maintenance of data warehouse and reporting capability, Offline Learning Application (OLA) capabilities among four participating institutions, off-line/on-line testing, interfaces with legacy Army systems, T-Cash eBusiness payment solution,  consolidated invoicing, marketing/conference support and  program status updates.  In addition, a Pre-Enrollment Readiness Profile (PReP) tool will be implemented in Fiscal Year 2005 to standardize the enro llment process and to assist Army Education Counselors in screening distance learning readiness prior to eArmyU enrollment.  The Army must ensure current eArmyU soldiers are served after the expiration of the existing contract.  Consequently, at a minimum a new contract(s) must be established to continue existing eArmyU critical services. In addition to the continuation of an eArmyU capability, the Army is considering the implementation of a centralized and virtual Army-wide education capability.  The Army needs assistance in defining a solution that can provide such a capability. Developme nt of a virtual capability is needed to support projected reduction in education center staff starting in FY06.  The virtual capability should automate and simplify many of the educational processes and services currently provided by the counselors and adm inistrative staff at the education centers.   High-level Army virtual education requirements include the following: centralized tuition assistance management capability to enable ACES to effectively view and manage tuition assistance funding and utilization across the Army; virtual counseling services  to support a robust interface between soldiers and ACES; anytime anywhere educational support for soldiers around the globe to include access to forms, Army regulation, and virtual education services. To further assist the eArmyU program, interested parties must provide responses to each of the following questions:   1.	Do you have a solution in house that meets the needs of eArmyU?  If so, is your solution Commercial Off the Shelf or is it a custom product? 2.	With the given requirements information and the timeline of the current contract expiring in December 2005, what would be the most effective contracting strategy? 3.	What level of virtual student services, such as program mentoring and tutoring, should eArmyU provide its DL students?  What services should institutions provide? What types  of academic online tutoring services currently exist at post-secondary institutions?   a.	Should Army require participating institutions to provide online academic tutoring services? b.	What are the advantages of including access to all these services in the Portal? c.	Is it necessary for the program to provide online digital library services, or are these services duplicitous at the institution level? d.	What is the future of online mentoring?  How might it look?  Do you think it is needed in order to decrease attrition rates and improve success? e.	Can on line educational counseling be provided in a virtual setting? 4.	Studies have indicated that soldiers should be required to demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in DL and in reading, math, and writing before admission to eArmyU.  Does your company provide a standardized pre-enrollment readiness tool?   5.	What are the pros and cons of enforcing standardization (common application, grades, student agreements, degree maps, etc.) among schools involved in eArmyU? a.	How can asynchronous online interaction between students and faculty be standardized across all education partners and courses? b.	How should testing and testing procedures be standardized across eArmyU?  Should academic standards for online unproctored testing be removed or changed to non-proctored online testing?   c.	Should the eArmyU contract require some standard of technological competency, infrastructure, or course management system from participating institutions (for purposes such as online posting of grades, offline learning applications with automatic synchr onization, etc.)? 6.  Do you see the cost of online learning as compared to traditional education leveling off, increasing or decreasing in the near and long term? 7.  How should ACES incorporate training for program staff into the contract so that staff are prepared to equally represent all degrees and institutions to soldiers at the time of program enrollment, thereby helping to equalize enrollment across all parti cipating academic institutions? 8.  How should the contract be structured? a.	How should education partners be contracted for services?  By Degree, by institution? b.	How can we ensure institutions and faculties are given the opportunity to provide input into the decision process for the eArmyU program? c.	What academic assessment requirements should be built into the contract to ensure that quality programs of instruction and assessment are maintained throughout the life of the contract? 9.  Have your products been certified as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) conformant?  If so, to what level and what version (1.2 or 2004)?  Will you provide test logs? 10.  Should the eArmyU portal and all web-based courses be ADA compliant and use W3C accessibility guidelines?   11.  Should the Army consider requiring courses be available for delivery in a variety of modes to include laptop, tablet and handheld devices? 12.  Should Army include contract requirements to support a wireless interface to eArmyU for soldiers and staff? 13.  Should the eArmyU program provide entirely asynchronous online delivery?  Would you consider blended learning approaches?  14.  What system documentation would you require to ensure a smooth and expedient transition from the current contractor?  What would be a reasonable timeline to accomplish the transition? 15.  Discuss how technology refresh is addressed in standard commercial practice and how your company performs it as part of your commercial management services. 16.  What is a feasible timeframe for the development of a virtual Army-wide education capability? 17.  The current contract is a base year with four option years.  What is a feasible timeframe for the duration of an academic contract? Please provide the following information regarding your organization. What is the size of your organization?  18.  Are you considered a small business and if so what is  your status (8(a), women owned, veteran owned, SDB, etc?) 19.  If you are a large business, discuss how you would develop an effective small business plan with aggressive goals? 20.  Do you plan to team with other businesses to provide the types of services discussed? 21.  Can your firm provide all the types of services discussed herein or are you interested in only portions of the tasks or services?  What portion of this contract would your organization bid on?  22.  Do you currently have any contracts to provide the same or similar services? 23.  The Government anticipates developing a performance work statement (PWS).  Do you have any suggestions on performance incentives, performance standards, and/or performance metrics?

(5) How will the program changes suggested in this study interact with other Federal support programs (including grant programs administered by States) for people with mental health issues (SAMHSA, CMHS, CMS)?  (6) How might the program rules in other Federal programs enhance or hinder the effectiveness of the suggested changes? (7) How will the suggested changes affect other benefits (Federal and State) the person may be receiving (Medicare/Medicaid, HUD, Transportation, Food Stamps, etc)?  and (8) Based on all of the above analysis, what would be the top priorities to change in SSA work incentives and program rules to have the greatest impact in supporting the work efforts of people with mental health diagnoses receiving disability benefits?

<DESC>Our goal is to determine contractor interest in a CUSTOMER PAY * contract in which the contractor will supply spare/repair parts to the ongoing High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)  Recapitalization (RECAP) Program at Red River Army Dep ot (RRAD), Texarkana TX.  The HMMWV RECAP program receives M998 configuration HMMWVs from field units, disassembles, replaces targeted parts and components, remanufactures others and rebuilds the vehicle to an M1097 configuration.  The vehicle is at that p oint a zero miles, zero hours platform ready for issue to tactical formations.  The spare/repair parts are to support the RECAP line; major assemblies such as engines and transmissions are not included.  It is anticipated that the start date will be Octobe r 2005 and run for one year (FY06).  The Government anticipates funding to be available for the completion of between 660 and 3,600 HMMWVs during FY 2006.  An option for an additional year (FY07) may be included, if the Government determines approximate re quirements before issuance of the solicitation.  * CUSTOMER PAY is a DoD initiative to optimize the supply chain by having DoD pay for materiel only when delivered for point of consumption use to the end user.  The objective is to move the point of inspect ion and point of sale to the point of use.  The concept involves the Contractor owning, managing, and delivering inventory to the customer.  The billing and payment cycle begins at the time of use by (or delivery to) the customer.

<SUBJECT>--PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SUPPORT
<DESC>Market survey for program management support associated with assessment of planning and capital requirements, recapitalization of the existing medical facility inventory, and improvement of facilities for quick response to changing requirements.  The  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District intends to negotiate a purchase order with Mitretek Systems, Inc., McLean, VA, as a nonprofit, conflict-of-interest free source, who does not compete for design or construction projects for private or governme nt entities and has a high degree of expertise in the requirement below.  This request is only a market survey, not a request for proposal (RFP) or announcement of a solicitation. The Health Facilities Planning Agency (HFPA) is responsible for the planning  and execution of facility-related investments for hospitals, clinics, research and other medically-related facilities world-wide.  The objective of this Statement of Work is to supplement HFPAs program management efforts by incorporating skilled contract ors knowledgeable about the resource requirements.  Because of the nature of this work a strict conflict of interest policy must be implemented.  HFPA is seeking support with its initiatives to: assess planning and capital requirements for Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) installations in selected markets and  multi-markets;  recapitalize the existing Army medical care delivery, medical research, an d biodefense laboratory inventory; shape and improve facilities in order to respond quickly and efficiently to the ever-changing face of Army and Military Health System (MHS) requirements; identify and use alternative business practices to leverage private  industry capital in the development of Army facility projects; and, research emerging facility technologies and find opportunities to incorporate these technologies into the Army healthcare facility life cycle management process. The contractor shall assist HFPA in gathering the information needed to acquire, allocate, and manage resources for HFPA military functions.  The contractor may be required to assist HFPA in considering and addressing impacts to its program as a result of troops restationing, BRAC announcements, and coordination and interfacing with the Services in multi-service markets.  The contractor will assist HFPA in conducting special studies, investigations, or focused analyses on a variety of healthcare related iss ues and topics.  These analyses may involve a focused area of inquiry or may involve assessment of a broad set of topics.  Such investigations will feature preparation of a special output document(s) which include policy recommendations and/or actionable i tems/recommendations that should be pursued and that can be referenced by HFPA. In order to support HFPA in managing its program, the following characteristics will be required of the contractor: - Independent and Objective.  To ensure credibility, consistency, and defensibility, the evaluation of contractor performance must be free of any perceived or actual bias, free from conflict of interest, and based on the best possible analysis and expertis e.  It is imperative that there be no potential for a conflict of interest on the part of the organization providing the required essential technical capability.  HFPA must be able to trust this organization with sensitive, government-proprietary informati on without concern for its misuse. - Access to HFPA Planning, Budgeting, and Acquisition Information.  Some activities require extensive access to planning, budgeting, and acquisition information.  Given the frequent restructuring of corporate ownership, it is difficult to ensure that the r elease of sensitive information to a profit-seeking entity is not going to eventually undermine the integrity of current or future procurements.  Even if there is no actual harm, the appearance of a conflict of interest could severely handicap HFPAs abili ty to act.  Actual organizational conflict of interes t is not eliminated completely by temporary exclusion clauses or Chinese walls that attempt to separate conflict-free portions of a company from other parts that could gain a competitive advantage through access to sensitive information, and none of these measures are effective against the appearance of a conflict of interest. - Need for an Honest Broker.  There are many competing priorities within the HFPA operating entities and the requirement exists to engage an organization that can provide objective assessments and recommendations on both external and internal positions.  T here is a continuing need to establish an objective resource to help HFPA sort out internal priorities and to represent a credible, independent input to the program management process.  This resource must have access to sensitive information and key decisi on makers, and have the mandate to provide neutral ground where internal priority conflicts can be examined and fairly resolved. - Continuity of Effort.  Informed program management decisions require enlightened advice based on broad, in-depth, and enduring knowledge of the HFPA corporate culture and way of doing business.  The use of a profit-seeking contractor to provide such cont inuity would be unwise in this situation because it would be difficult to maintain continuity without giving unfair competitive advantage and inhibiting appropriate free and open competition. To fulfill its responsibilities with the highest level of efficiency and cost effectiveness, HFPA requires the support of an organization that can simultaneously: - Provide a general program management support, which it has successfully applied to other large and complex systems, - Have access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to government and private sector data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and facilities, and - Operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence and with freedom from any organizational conflict of interest. The support of an experienced, conflict free contractor is particularly important to HFPA when its policy choices and decision making have long range and far reaching implications. This support will be used to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of HFPA, but it will not be used to perform inherently governmental functions or when the need can be met as effectively with in house resources or by other contra ct support gained via competition.  The contractor will be used when continuity of effort is critical, when the contractor possesses a unique and essential knowledge base, and/or when it is necessary to have access to sensitive or proprietary information, including strategic planning information.  The contractor will also be used when the nature of the work is such that it must be performed by an entity operating in the public interest, without profit motive, with objectivity and independence, and with free dom from organizational conflicts of interest. Responses are required within fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice.  Respondents must demonstrate a broad capability in the statement of work above. Responses should be addressed to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C, P.O . Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or jacalyn.m.jenkins@sam.usace.army.mil and will be directed to Mrs. Jacalyn Jenkins, (251) 441-5598.  Firms interested in being considered shall provide brief documentation of the company's capability to perform the work required, and past performance of similar work.  A list of completed projects with similar requirements shall be submitted, along with the project location, and the names and telephone numbers of customer points of contact.  The Government will not pay for  any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of six months from the date of pu blication of this notice. The NIAC CODE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT IS 541618.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for:  Item 1, Qty. 1, Pulsed Electron Source Package, Item 2, Qty. 1, Target Carousel Flange Assembly, Item 3, Qty. 1 Pulsed Electron Deposition Automation Package, Item 4, Qty. 1, Installation and Training. The Contractor shall furnish Items 1 through 4 which shall meet the following specifications: An existing Kurt J. Lesker Co. AXXIS thin film deposition system shall be upgraded to provide ablative deposition of thin films utilizing a pulsed electron beam. The upgrade shall include: •	Item 1. Pulsed electron source with power supply  •	Item 2. Target carousel flange assembly •	Item 3. Automation package (Windows version) for control of the pulsed electron source and the target carousel. This package shall include a control computer and interface electronics.  •	Item 4. Installation, manuals and training.  Companies responding to this request for quotations shall demonstrate their ability to provide the required upgrade by supplying the following: 1. Specification sheets that show the offered equipment meets the requirements listed here. 2. Mechanical drawings that show the offered equipment is physically compatible with the Lesker AXXIS system. 3. A sample of a superconducting film that was deposited using the offered equipment shall be provided. The film shall be yttrium-barium-copper-oxide. The company shall also provide data that demonstrates that this film has a superconducting transition temperature greater than 77 K.  Configuration of Deposition System: An existing Kurt J. Lesker Co. AXXIS thin film deposition system shall be upgraded to provide ablative deposition of thin films using a pulsed electron beam. The AXXIS chamber is, essentially, a horizontal cylinder.  Six 8” CF ports are arrayed, in a radial pattern, around the cylinder.  The axes of these ports intersect each other at the center line of the chamber.  For each of these ports, the distance from the flange face to the center line of the chamber is 14”. The axes of these ports are contained by a vertical plane that is designated the six-port plane. Sputter deposition sources are mounted in the upper three ports. The 2” diameter substrate is loaded through a door in the front of the chamber. The substrate is mounted in a substrate holder which is attached to a rotary feedthrough in the door. This feedthrough allows the substrate to be rotated about the center line to face the desired deposition source.  Additionally, the chamber includes a port for a pulsed electron source.  This is an 8” CF port, located on top of the chamber, towards the rear.	This port is aimed forward at 45° to the center line. The axis of this port passes through the center line to a point 5.13” beneath the chamber center line and 0.5” to the rear of the aforementioned six-port plane. The distance from the plane of the flange face to this point is 21”. This point shall correspond to the center of the top surface of the selected target when the target carousel flange assembly is mounted in the bottom port of the six radially arranged ports.	The pulsed electron source shall be mounted to an existing z-translator on the pulsed electron source port. The z-translator has 8” CF flanges and a 6” range. Fully retracted, the z-translator has a length of  6” (flange face to flange face). For pulsed electron deposition, the z-translator length will be set at 7.0” +/- 0.5”.  Both the pulsed electron source (with the z-translator extended) and the target carousel shall not interfere with rotation of the substrate holder. In the AXXIS chamber, the substrate holder rotates about the center line to allow for deposition from the various sources.  For example, the substrate is rotated to face upwards for deposition from a sputter source mounted in the top port. For pulsed electron beam deposition, the substrate will be rotated to face downwards. The center of the surface of the downward facing substrate is 1.13” below the center line of the chamber and 0.5” towards the rear of the six-port plane. When rotated, the substrate holder extends no further than 4.53” from the chamber centerline and no further than 4.125” to the rear of the six-port plane. Description of Items: ITEM 1.  Pulsed electron source package. The pulsed electron source package shall have the following characteristics.  -	110 VAC, single phase operation -	energy of electrons, ~8-20 kV -	pulse width of ~100 nanoseconds (ns) -	maximum pulse energy of at least 800 mJ -	minimum pulse energy of &lt;100 mJ -	pulse energy variation, +/- 10% -	pulse power density, maximum, &gt;1E+8 W/cm2 -	Z-axis alignment, 50 mm -	X and Y alignment, +/- 20 mm -	operating pressure range, &lt;5 to &gt;20 mTorr -	capable of operating with oxygen backfill as well as with inert gases -	maximum pulsed electron beam source body temperature, 85 degrees Celsius -	flange size, 8.0” CF ITEM 2, Target carousel flange assembly.  -	the carousel shall index six 1” deposition targets -	the carousel shall rotate the selected target during deposition -	shall operate on 110 VAC -	all rotary feedthroughs shall be magnetic fluid sealed -	flange size, 8.0” CF ITEM 3, Pulsed electron deposition automation package. Shall include: -	Pentium-based control computer with keyboard, mouse and monitor -	plug-in board for control computer -	Windows compatible software package preinstalled on computer  -	interface electronics for computer, servo motor, synchronous motor and laser trigger -	positioning of the target selected for deposition -	control of speed of rotation of the target selected for deposition -	control of pulse rate of the electron beam -	control of  X, Y and Z axis alignment of electron beam within the range specified in the description of Item 1 ITEM 4, Installation and Training. -	install items 1, 2 and 3 in the AXXIS system, located in Bldg 77 at the NASA Glenn Research Center within 2 weeks of delivery.  The actual installation and training date shall be via mutual agreement between the Government and Contractor.  Installation and training shall be performed Monday-Friday, non-federal holidays, during normal business hours at NASA Glenn Research Center (typically 8 a.m to 5 p.m.) -	demonstrate operability of the pulsed electron beam deposition system. -	demonstrate non-interference with existing functions of the AXXIS system. -	train up to 4 technicians and scientists in the operation of all components of the system. -	provide 3 copies of operation and maintenance manuals.

Questions & Answers
September 13, 2004

*Question = Q
*Answer   = A

1.	Q - 4 6' Graphic Pods each with 2 graphic panels lights, Please provide more information, I can't seem to locate on the Internet.
 	      A - These are 3-D graphic structures that light from the inside and  
            illuminate a double-sided design.

2.	Q - 4-plexi panels and case Please provide more information.
                  A - Panels to help attendees find entrance to the exhibit and cases to store 
                  and protect the panels.  

	3.  Q - Switch box - Please define
            A - Electrical switch box.  

	4.  Q - Closet panels - Does this request include packaging such as a crate?
           A - Storage panels fthat build into storage space for the exhibit materials. 

	5.  Q - "1 Truss components for rotating sign that graphics can attach to                      	      magnetically and the monitors can hang from.
	      A - A rotating hoop mounted to a truss that rotates it.  Along the truss, 4                    
            monitors to display looping presentation.

	6.  Q - No specific size or dimension has been given in order to acquire pricing.  
            Also, this line item refers to Magnetic graphics. Are these existing and if so, 		     what is their size and substrate? Since the RFQ calls for significant graphic 	
           production, it would seem these graphics would also be produced as part of the 
           package. 
                A - The pricing should result from the bidder's design suggestion, which 
                would reveal the size, materials, etc.  These magnetic graphics are also  
                part of the design created by the bidder.  

     7.  Q - Hanging sign - Size and shape is not defined
	    A – O nce again, these things are defined by the bidder's design.

     8.  Q - Preview - Does the CDC want to preview these items, in full, prior to 	      
          delivery at the show site? 
                A - Absolutely.  Would also need to apprve and clear production through 
                the various stages.

9.   Q - Shipping - No destination has been provided. You mentioned multiple use.                                                                           Is this RFQ for one show?                                                                                                                                                                                                           A - The first destination is DC.  The rest are still unknown.  Would want to know if there is a service for storing and managing the shipment of the exhibit to other sites in the future.
10. Q - Storage? 
A - See above.
11. Q - A supervisor and expenses are easy to calculate. However, this RFQ requests electrical service and lead machine from the General Contractor or the show, but, does mention other services such as cleaning or installation/dismantle labor. Generally, services from the GC are ordered together, so, this raises a flag. Will this be handled by CDC directly? Material Handling (drayage) is also not mentioned, however, this number cannot be estimated until the actual show name, location and general contractor is provided as these rates vary greatly from city to city and show to show as well as installation dates. 
A - It's the APHA Conference in DC on Nov 6-10th.  Bidder can look up their specifications and give us his figure accordingly.
12. Q - Please clarify electrical placement and required wattage. This cannot be estimated until the actual show name, location and general contractor is provided as these rates vary greatly from city to city and show to show as well as installation dates. 
A - See above.
13.  Q - Is the hardware purchase or rental?
        A - Hardware: Rental 

14.   Q - Where is the conference location (city, facility, etc)?
        A - Washington, DC; Washington Convention Center 

15.   Q - Can you provide a sketch/cad of the layout?  How large is the space provided?
        A -  copy of the floor plan attached.

16.   Q - On the cartridge-free banner stands, what does it mean, "proprietary extrusion?"  
        It reads as if the "proprietary extrusion" is part of the graphic panel.  That is very  
        confusing. 
        A -  These are smaller retractable banners.   




17.   Q - What are the dimensions of the truss components for the rotating sign?  Also, 
        what are the dimension for the rotating sign?  What shape is the rotating sign?  Can  
        you also provide drawings/sketch of the rotating sign?  In order to quote 
        competitively and fairly, we need this information.
        A - the concept  file should be adequate.

18.   Q -   Is the truss collapsible or rigid?  There is no mention of cases for the truss . . . if 
         needed, would it require cases or crates?   If crates, any specifics?
        A - It's collapsible.  Would have cases for shipping.  Offerors should tell us the 
        specifics of what our options could be about the cases.  

19.   Q - What is the motor size and rpm? 
        A - depends upon the design of the offferors  

20.   Q -  Are the flat screen monitors 20"? 
        A -  depends upon the design of the offferors  

21.   Q - Are the graphics cases for the banner stands the carrying bags that come with the 
        banner stands? 
        A – depends upon the design of the offferors  

22.   Q -  Is there any specific criteria for the monitor bracket? 
        A – depends upon the design of the offferors

1.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK

1.1 SCOPE:  Air Combat Command has previously contracted for soil column tests to evaluate Small Arms Firing Range (SAFR) site-specific materials to aid in the selection of the best and most cost-effective stabilizing media for lead and copper migration in storm water.  This SOW requires the contractor to provide technical review of the test method, analysis, and results for scientific completeness.  This SOW requires a technical and scientific review of the work performed by separate contractor detailed in section 1.2, paragraph 2, item 4), to ascertain its efficacy in support of the conclusions and recommendations in the report associated report.  Also, this SOW requires a technical and scientific review of the item 4) work relative to future publication by the Air Force as novel technology for the management of lead and copper migration from SAFRs.  This requirement is only soliciting offerors from the scientific community within 175 miles of Langley AFB, VA in an effort to maintain close contact with our scientific advisors.

1.2 BACKGROUND:  The Department of Defense (DoD) operates more than 2,600 SAFRs nation-wide. Air Combat Command operates 16 SAFR complexes and various skeet ranges.  Bullets fired at these ranges accumulate in earthen berms and contain heavy metals, including soluble and fragmented lead species.  Discharge of these projectiles into a collection earthen berm, the subsequent accumulation of lead, and release into the environment poises potential harm to human health and the environment.   Preventing lead discharge is important not only for regulatory reasons, but also because of the biological uptake potential and toxicity characteristics of lead.  

Air Combat Command has previously contracted a comprehensive investigation of SAFRs at 11 Air Force installations to characterize the storm water migration of lead and copper.  The primary concern of this investigation is to address the mobilization of lead and copper via storm water discharge to surface locations down gradient to the SAFR complex.  The purpose of the investigation is to determine, 1) the character and amounts of lead and copper that has migrated outside of the SAFR complex, 2) what are the regulatory implications of any amount of lead and copper accumulation, 3) the clean-up requirements, and 4) via laboratory and field research, assess methods to immobilize lead and copper ions, and prepare concept designs, specific to each bases needs, to prevent future releases of lead and copper to the surrounding SAR environment.

Item 4) of the prior contract includes batch tests on site-specific materials to determine the most efficacious and cost-effective stabilizing media.  Item 4) work also includes a study of the compatibilities of chemistry, soil types and local environment for the soil type at each SAFR.  Further, soil column tests are being performed on site-specific materials to provide site-specific data to aid in the selection of the best and most cost effective stabilizing media.  Stabilizing agents may include different phosphates, silicates, zeolites, nanocomposites, and granulated activated carbon.  Laboratory analysis includes, but is not limited to p batch tests on site-specific materials to determine the most efficacious and cost-effective stabilizing media.  Item 4) work also includes a study of the compatibilities of chemistry, soil types and local environment for the soil type at each SAFR.  Further, soil column tests are being performed on site-specific materials to provide site-specific data to aid in the selection of the best and most cost effective stabilizing media.  Stabilizing agents may include different phosphates, silicates, zeolites, nanocomposites, and granulated activated carbon.  Laboratory analysis includes, but is not limited to particle sizing, energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence/scanning electron microscopy (XRD/SEM) analysis for each of the materials and samples.

This requirement is only soliciting offerors from the scientific community within 175 miles of Langley AFB, VA in an effort to maintain close contact with our scientific advisors.

1.2 BACKGROUND:  The Department of Defense (DoD) operates more than 2,600 SAFRs nation-wide. Air Combat Command operates 16 SAFR complexes and various skeet ranges.  Bullets fired at these ranges accumulate in earthen berms and contain heavy metals, including soluble and fragmented lead species.  Discharge of these projectiles into a collection earthen berm, the subsequent accumulation of lead, and release into the environment poises potential harm to human health and the environment.   Preventing lead discharge is important not only for regulatory reasons, but also because of the biological uptake potential and toxicity characteristics of lead.  

Air Combat Command has previously contracted a comprehensive investigation of SAFRs at 11 Air Force installations to characterize the storm water migration of lead and copper.  The primary concern of this investigation is to address the mobilization of lead and copper via storm water discharge to surface locations down gradient to the SAFR complex.  The purpose of the investigation is to determine, 1) the character and amounts of lead and copper that has migrated outside of the SAFR complex, 2) what are the regulatory implications of any amount of lead and copper accumulation, 3) the clean-up requirements, and 4) via laboratory and field research, assess methods to immobilize lead and copper ions, and prepare concept designs, specific to each bases needs, to prevent future releases of lead and copper to the surrounding SAR environment.

Item 4) of the prior contract includesarticle sizing, energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence/scanning electron microscopy (XRD/SEM) analysis for each of the materials and samples.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HIGH VACUUM CARBON EVAPORATION SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to inform offerors of the change in the evaluation criteria’s that will be used to evaluate quotations, address questions, and to extend the due date for quotes. The following provision has been added: 52.212-2 EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose offer (1) meets all the requirements in the statement of work (SOW) and (2) presents the best combination of price and qualitative value to the government. The contract award will be decided through the use of a best value selection (BVS) process, which seeks to select the offer with the best combination of qualitative merit and price.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, the award will be made to the vendor with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contract).	However, the government can choose to award to a vendor whose offer provides a higher qualitative merit provided the difference in price is commensurate with the added value.	Conversely, the government will consider making the award to a vendor whose proposal has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and the other proposals warrants doing so. The SOW serves as the government’s baseline requirements.  Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements will be judged against the value characteristics listed below.	These establish what the government considers to be valuable in an offer in and beyond the baseline requirements.  The value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer that provides better results for a reasonable increase in price.	The value characteristics combined are of equal importance to price or cost.  Vendors should provide adequate information about how their offer meets the criteria in order to permit a proper evaluation. Best Value Characteristics: 1)	Demonstrated performance:  The vendor shall provide contact information for a minimum of three existing installations in university, corporate, or government facilities. 2)	The vendor shall provide historical evidence of fabricating, selling and supporting the equipment outlined in the baseline proposal.   3)	The vendor shall demonstrate the durability of products:  This procurement will replace a unit that has been in operation for thirty years.  4)	Ease of operation: Control of the proposed equipment shall be automated and have an easy to use user interface.  5)	Ease of use and functionality of sample tilting and rotation requirement.   6)	Availability of consumable carbon rods of sufficient quality relative to expense, as to provide excellent carbon coatings for high resolution transmission electron microscopy research. 7)	Dry vacuum system:  As outlined in the baseline, the system will have a dry scroll roughing pump and a turbo molecular pump.  The vendor shall provide a description of the actual performance of these pumps and the degree to which the pumps would provide an oil-free coating environment is important.  For example, would turbo molecular pump have sealed grease bearings or have magnetic levitation bearings? The following questions received from potential proposers are listed below with answers. Question 1:  The solicitation states that a piezoelectric thickness monitor would be beneficial, but not essential. Should such hardware be quoted separately as an option, or should it be included in a proposal provided the offered system is compatible with such a device. Answer 1: Quote as an option.  Question 2: The solicitation specifies a 'large chamber' compatible of handling a 20cm diameter sample. Is there any need to handle unusually 'thick' samples? For example would a 12" diameter by 14" tall bell jar system be acceptable? Answer 2: Unusually thick samples are not anticipated.  Specific dimensions of the system can vary provided the system has proven performance for coating a 20 cm diameter wafer.	 Question 3: A dry vacuum system is specified in the solicitation. Is a truly dry vacuum system required, ie a maglev turbo - or would a grease lubricated turbo be acceptable? Answer 3: A maglev turbo-molecular pump is not required.	A turbo molecular pump with specification similar to the Edwards EXT models is sufficient.  E.G.  -water cooling standard (forced air cooling available as an option)  -lifetime lubricated ceramic bearings  -oil-free operation  -low vibration  -mounting in any orientation (some versions; see below)  -full stack turbomolecular (12 stage version) or short stack (8 stage version) operation  The EXT series turbo pumps each have an inlet screen to prevent debris from falling into the pump, and a vent port part way up the rotor stack to ensure maximum cleanliness. Question 4 Would it be desirable to quote a closed cycle cryo trap in place of a LN2 trap? Answer 4: No. Question 5: Where is the LN2 trap going to be installed?   Answer 5: The LN2 trap is expected to be placed in a position within the system for which the manufacturer has established a historically proven location for removal of out-gassing volatiles, thereby assisting the dynamic vacuum system with maintaining the optimal high vacuum conditions for carbon evaporation.  Question 6: Why do you need LN2 trap with a Turbo molecular pump?   Answer 6: It is a NASA requirement. Question 7: Detailed information on the rotation, speed and angle of tilt. Automated or manual operation?   Answer 7: Rotation speed should be adjustable approximately in the range of 0.25 through 2 revolutions per second. The angle of tilt should extend from zero to at least forty-five degrees, as measured from horizontal (typical coating position). The process should be automated.  Question 8: What is the film uniformity needed?   Answer 8: The film should be suitable for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and uniform in thickness and grain size over an area of up to 8-inch diameter. Question 9: Is there a specific rod design or diameter in mind?   Answer 9: Rod designs that have proven evaporation performance within the proposed system, and which are easily obtainable from various vendors. Question 10: Do you wish to coat the entire surface of the 8" wafer or substrate with carbon?   Answer 10: Yes. Question 11: Does this surface have to be tilted at different angles and then rotated at that angle?   Answer 11: At eight inches sample diameter, no.  For sample diameters of two inches and smaller, yes. Question 12: What is the application of this system? Answer 12: Application of the conductive carbon coatings is for high resolution field emission scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as electron microprobe analysis. Question 13: What is the sample type (200 mm wafer?) for mounting interfaces? Answer 13: Samples range from TEM grids, small millimeter sized samples on standard sem sample stubs, to one inch round glass slides to, large 200 mm wafers.	The large 200mm wafers would not need tilting during rotation. Question 14: What is the required chamber size?  Answer 14: The minimum required size is to accommodate samples and provide for uniform coatings. Question 15: What source is to substrate distance? Answer 15: As determined by historical systems with proven history of providing uniform coatings. NOTE: All contractual and technical questions must be in writing (e-mail or fax) to Seena Mathews not later than September 21, 2004. Telephone questions will not be accepted. The due date for receipt of offers is extended from September 14, 2004 to October 14, 2004, by 12:00 noon. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on August 2, 2004. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to vendor questions received to date.  QUESTION #1:  In CLIN 0012 and 0014 you are asking for us to provide 1 year service quantity 36 months and 72 months.  I am not sure what this means.  Pricing is based on a number of years not months.  Can you help me with this?  ANSWER:  The quantity is 3 each and 6 each times 12 months equals 36 and 72.  Each is for 1 year.  QUESTION #2:  What would be the best means of sending in our response for the Bluecoat Solicitation?  US Mail? Fax? Or email?  ANSWER:  Any method is okay as long as it arrives by the date and time specified in the solicitation.   QUESTION #3:  I need to know where I have to send my proposal or if I have to access any web page through which I will send my proposal.   ANSWER:  Send your proposal electronically to brenda.geist@dla.mil or mail to DLA, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Stop 6220, Attn:  DES-ACC, Brenda Geist, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6220 or facsimile 703-767-1172.  QUESTION #4:  Which documentation do you need with the Proposal?  ANSWER:  A cost proposal along with the Representations and Certifications specified in the Federal Business Opportunities announcement.  QUESTION #5:  I have found both of the FAR documents 52.212-1 and 52.212-3, but cannot find the DFARS 252.212-7000. Would it be possible for you to send me that document to ensure we have this on file.  ANSWER:  It can be found at the following web site http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/html/current/252212.htm.  QUESTION #6:  Is there a particular reason why this was changed to “Unrestricted” status?  Is there a current vendor doing business with the account that is not classified “Small Business”?  ANSWER:  After further research it was determined that the manufacturer of the product is not a small business, thus the acquisition was not eligible for small business set-aside status.  QUESTION #7:  We are a small business, and were planning on bidding this opportunity.  Why was the small business set-aside removed?  ANSWER:  See response to question #6.  Offers are due 27 Aug 04, 10:00 a.m.., Andrew T. McNamara Headquarters Complex, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Stop 6220, Suite 1145, Fort Belvoir, VA  22060-6220.
