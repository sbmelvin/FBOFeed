<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Synopsis. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This serves as a "Notice of Intent" of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate's intent to issue a modification to increase the maximum ordering amount of the basic contract FA8750-09-D-0022, titled "Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System Tool Kit (WebTAS TK)" on a sole source basis. The current contract maximum ordering amount is $498M and the contemplated maximum ordering amount increase is $85M for a new maximum ordering amount of $583M. This contract is being performed by Intelligent Software Solutions, CAGE Code: 1CCC6. The Air Force plans to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), to increase the maximum ordering amount of the WebTAS TK contract. WebTAS supports Air Force efforts in providing Department of Defense commands, services and various Federal Agencies with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity and association information. The flexible WebTAS architecture provides access to multiple data sources, data mining, and collaboration tools that facilitate trend, link, pattern, and distributed analysis to support activity prediction and customer unique capabilities like Combined Information Data Network Exchange (CIDNE), International Distributed Uniform Reporting Environment (INDURE), Strategic Worldwide Integration Capability (SWIC), Air Force National to Tactical Integration (AF NTI) and Master Air Attach Plan (MAAP) Toolkit.</p>
<p>Critical functional requirements arose that required development of additional software releases, within a shorter timeframe, to respond to urgent war-fighter needs. These critical requirements will result in the WebTAS TK contract exceeding the current maximum ordering amount in a shorter timeframe. The services provided by Intelligent Software Solutions which must continue without interruption include real-time spiral releases of the Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System Tool Kit (WebTAS TK) software, and sustainment of the operational baseline to meet the functional requirements of users through software enhancement and on-site engineering support. Technical enhancements are needed to correct identified shortcomings in the systems and provide additional capabilities, features, and processes. The enhancements will extend functions and provide effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the user. Installation and on-site engineering support will also be required at new and existing customer sites worldwide. Without continuous enhancements and sustainment of the WebTAS TK baseline, urgent war fighter needs would be jeopardized.</p>
<p>Due to critical requirements above, the current burn rate has increased to a point where additional ceiling will be required to continue the highly specialized services being performed under the current contract to address urgent war fighter needs while a follow-on contract is being pursued. The Air Force believes that if the ceiling is not increased, there will be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the war fighter requirements. As such, there would be significant risk to not only the Air Force, but to the supported DoD Commands, Services, and Federal agencies if a sole source contract is not awarded to provide necessary enhancement and sustainment under the current contract. Technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, Michael Welch at (315) 330-7758, email: Michael.Welch@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541712. Responses and inquiries can be mailed to the Contract Specialist, Ashley Busa, AFRL/RIKF, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441 or e-mailed to Ashley.Busa@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. <br /><br />IAW FAR 8.405-2 this opportunity is available only to those firms that were determined to have the capabilities under a sources sought notice - RFQ555797.<br />The main goal of the HITECH Act is to improve the nation's health care through the adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and promotion of the meaningful use of EHR via incentive payments. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expects that "meaningful EHR users" would demonstrate each of the following: meaningful use of a certified EHR, the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care, and reporting on clinical quality and other measures using certified EHR technology. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), along with CMS, has identified criteria to define meaningful use of EHR.<br />In the early stages of meaningful use, Eligible Professionals and Eligible Hospitals will attest that they are meaningful users of EHRs. Upon attestation, they will be eligible to receive an incentive payment. <br />CMS has been tasked to design and develop the necessary systems functionality to enable implementation of the HITECH Act. CMS Office of Financial Management (OFM) is responsible for auditing various components of the HITECH program, and oversees the audit process and the contractor is needed to perform the actual audit of the "meaningful EHR users".<br />CMS is responsible for providing oversight of the types of organizations listed above. CMS's oversight of "meaningful EHR users" is a monitoring control process designed to ensure they are in compliance with regulations established within applicable HITECH law, and therefore eligible to participate in the incentive program.
<p>Upon the completion of the audit, the contractor is required to communicate non compliances identified to the organizations or personnel. CMS Management will evaluate the evidence in order to make a final determination of each "meaningful EHR users" eligibility.</p>
<p>The ARRA specifies that CMS shall commence making payments effective January 1, 2011, or as soon as CMS systems are capable. The audit process will need be started soon after the first payments are made. <br />The Government anticipates awarding a Times and Material contract. No other contract type is suitable for this effort. At this time, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. The Project Officer has not been able to accurately estimate, with a reasonable degree of confidence, the amount of time required to complete the effort.</p>
<p>The contracting officer is aware and intends to require appropriate Government surveillance of contract performance in order to give reasonable assurances that efficient methods and effective cost controls are being used. The contracting officers intends to request periodic floor checks be performed by the CMS cost pricing staff in order to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>The contract will include a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. <br />CMS intends to award a three year contract (1 year base period with 2 option years) to an audit review contractor to conduct the HITECH Meaningful use audits. <br />See sources sought notice posted on e-Buy on 4/3/11, RFQ 555797, for details of notice.</p>

<DESC><p>Background <br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program is designed to promote the sustainability of the Medicare program by shifting Medicare beneficiaries' health care costs to private sources of payment, when available. The MSP law states that Medicare is prohibited from making payment where payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by another insurer. In order to adhere to its statutory requirements, CMS' MSP program performs two primary functions: (1) coordinating benefits in order to ensure that Medicare pays properly, and (2) pursuing recoveries, where Medicare has paid conditionally and is entitled to reimbursement. The intent of this Sources Sought is to identify potential small or small disadvantaged businesses sources that are capable of performing both functions and all associated activities known as the Business Process &amp; Program Operations. <br />CMS is seeking to establish a centralized Coordination of Benefits (COB) and Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery (MSPR) operation by consolidating under a single program, the performance of all activities that support the collection, management, and reporting of other insurance coverage of Medicare beneficiaries, and the collection of mistaken primary payments. These activities are currently being performed under two separate contracts. CMS intends to establish a centralized COB and MSPR operation that provides quality customer service and a single source to Medicare providers, suppliers, beneficiaries, insurers and other stakeholders by streamlining the MSP data and debt collection processes while ensuring the integrity of the Medicare Trust Funds.</p>
<p><br />Overall goals in this consolidation initiative are to:<br />&bull; Administer the MSP process more efficiently and effectively by providing a single contractor entity to operate, coordinate and maintain the MSP process and thus generate cost savings through a reduction in mistaken primary Medicare payments and identification of conditional Medicare payments.<br />&bull; Provide beneficiaries and their representatives with a more efficient, user friendly and less intrusive MSP identification and debt recovery operation by streamlining the process from the collection of MSP information through to the collection of debt. <br />&bull; Achieve other cost reductions and management efficiencies by consolidating performance of similar activities (e.g., mail-room activities, Customer Service / Help Desk activities, etc.) that are necessary to carry out daily operations.<br />&bull; Provide greater flexibility in contracting to ensure the best earned value for the government. <br />&bull; Enhance program integrity consistent with the objectives of the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP).</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:judith.a.kibler@usace.army.mil">USACE District St. Louis</a>
<DESC>There are three major projects to this effort at the Kansas City Veterans Administration Medical Center; each one is comprised of several smaller pieces.  The work consists of renovating 2 and one half floors within occupied medical center in the main tower, building 1. The designs for these projects have been completed by two separate A/E firms.  We will be soliciting proposals from qualified and experienced Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns.  <br>Project 589-362, Renovate 7E Dialysis - the contractor shall completely prepare site for building for operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, asbestos abatement, plumbing, HVAC, electrical, communications and other work necessary for a complete and functional dialysis unit.   There will be special water requirements for Dialysis, a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system and Dialyzing Acid system will be required.  Existing Dialysis units are portable and will be relocated and used in the new area.  <br>Project 589-363, Renovate 5th Floor Inpatient Surgery - the contractor shall completely prepare site for building Inpatient Surgery Ward and Ambulatory Surgery Operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, and furnish labor and materials and perform work for Inpatient Surgery as required by drawings and specification.   There will be special rooms for Spinal Chord Patients and singular bed rooms for other patients including Infection Control rooms.  This Project will be completed in two phases, East first then West side for final construction.  <br>Project 589-367, Renovate 10th Floor for Inpatient Psychiatry - this project will construct a state of the art Inpatient Psychiatry ward that will accommodate patient needs to include space consideration for a treatment population of highly complex psychiatric patients comprised of general psychiatry patients, female psychiatry patients, geriatric psychiatry patients and psychiatry patients with complex medical needs. Specific attention will be given to space requirements for the protection of patient privacy, gender specific bathroom/shower areas, areas for group activities and the safety/security precautions for both patients and staff members. The 10th floor will have special Patient Safety requirements for suicide prevention. This project will be completed in 2 phases, East first then patients on the West side will be moved to the new space on the West side and West side construction will begin.  <br>The work on the 5th, 7th, and 10th floors will be concurrent.  Some work (heavy demolition, core drilling, high noise generation) will need to be scheduled other than normal business hours.  Because this is renovation work and not new construction, experience working in an operating medical facility is vital.  The VA will require the prime contractor to have documentable experience showing completed projects of similar size and scope in a hospital environment, their ability to manage subcontractors, vendors and employees within the facility and respect boundaries (noise, infection control, physical, etc). <br> <br><br>

The effort will include the: research and development of parametric information models; design of physical and logical database structures; development of capabilities to interactively maintain data within the databases; implementation of the capabilities necessary to derive tailored specialized products from the textual and parametric databases and multimedia object repositories; design of high level constructs that dynamically incorporate database information into knowledge-oriented objects; and the development, implementation and maintenance of customer friendly software applications/tools and interfaces; as specified in each task order's Work Description.</p>
<p>The AVIPSS consists of the Systematic Architecture for Virtual Analytic Net-Centric Threat Intelligence (SAVANT<sup>TM</sup>) system, the Next Generation Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) System (NGES), the Foreign Media Collaboration Framework (FMCF) and its extensions and additional architecture and legacy infrastructure, analysis and information systems. Major components of the SAVANT<sup>TM</sup> are the: Knowledge Pre-positioning System (KPS); Virtual Production System (VPS); Virtual Intelligence Product Retrieval Environment (VIPRE); the NASIC Metadata Repository (NMR); and the Joint Analytic Data Editor (JADE). Support shall be provided for the systems including (but not limited to): Ballistic Missile Information System (BMIS); Digital Library Input Processing System (DLIPS); Foreign Military Laser Database (FMLD); Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) Portal; Tactics and Training, Track Military Entities (TrackME); Data Tracker; Production Operations Management Information Systems (PROMIS); GlobalEdge; Military Equipment Parametric Engineering Database (MEPED); Dynamic Information Operations Decision Environment (DIODE); Space mission area products; and SharePoint Open Source Portal.</p>

Further, this effort will support the research and development, enhancement, implementation and maintenance of national level systems for the input, translation, and retrieval of all-source information and for the continued design, development, implementation, and deployment of a DODIIS-wide information notification system as specified in each task order's Work Description.</p>
<p>Anticipated activities and deliverables include: operations, maintenance and system administration services; computer software; software documentation; software engineering analyses; and research and development. This procurement is a Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) utilizing an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. AFRL anticipates the utilization of both Firm Fixed Price (FFP) - Completion and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - Completion type Task Orders with an ordering period of 30 months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $49,900,000.</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (APR 2010) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Barbara Gehrs, Building 15, RM 225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 facsimile: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-225-4407.

The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>A Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is expected to be posted for review and comment at a later date. The entire solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov. All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of all other information pertaining to this solicitation.</p>
<p>While the Small Business Specialist, Janis Norelli, is the focal point for receipt of the statements of capabilities, technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, James Sieffert, 315-330-2344 or email James.Sieffert@rl.af.mil. Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Joseph Facciolo, 315-330-4981, or e-mail Joseph.Facciolo@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>Large businesses are also encouraged to submit emails of intent to Joseph.Facciolo@rl.af.mil should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NOTE: Due to limitations of the FedBizOpps website, the Government is unable to post both the Sources Sought and Pre-Solicitation Notices using the same Solicitation Number. Therefore, the Government is posting the Sources Sought Notice at Solicitation Number "E21269_AVIPSS_IV", which will contain only the Sources Sought Notice and all modification thereto.

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is sponsoring a satellite meeting on "Development and Applications of Biomarkers of Alcohol Abuse and Tissue Damage, Cancer and Neurodegeneration" at the 2011 meeting of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists. The session will take place at the Walter E Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC from 1:00 to 4:00 pm on Sunday, October 23.
<p><br />Biomarkers have considerable potential as indicators of disease states and processes as well as aids in assessing responses to therapeutics. Biomarkers of alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence and alcohol-induced tissue and organ damage are necessary for detection and diagnosis of alcohol use disorders and for evaluations of the efficacy of treatments for these disorders. The symposium will feature examples of alcohol-related biomarker signatures that reflect both alcohol consumption and alcohol-mediated tissue damage. Additional presentations will describe novel biomarkers in the fields of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, with the goal of gaining insights that may be broadly applicable. Challenges and prospects for development and application of biomarkers in the pharmaceutical industry will also be addressed. The approaches and successes to be described may serve to increase interest in alcohol-related biomarkers and promote further progress in this area as well as in the development and application of biomarkers in general.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but registration is required. Additional information, including registration forms can be found at http://www.seiservices.com/niaaasatellite/1038045/default.aspx.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to issue a limited sources award under a Federal Supply Schedule for Software Maintenance Support for EnCase Software currently utilized by the TRICARE Management Activity to immixGroup.  Annual Software Maintenance Services (SMS) shall include annual software maintenance support to include upgrades, new releases, remedy of defects, on-line and emergency on-site support services for the following Encase Products:  (1)  EnCase (IA) Cybersecurity SMS  (2) Encase Enterprise SMS (to include HL USB Security Key, NAS Examiner, SAFE HL Time USB Security Key). The Period of Performance will be a twelve month base (annual) period with two twelve month (annual) option periods. Currently immixGroup, Inc. supports the maintenance support for EnCase Software utilized by the TRICARE Management Activity Office of the Chief Information Officer under a contract awarded in 2010 under Contract W81XWH-10-F-0537.  This Contract was for a 12-month base and multiple 12-month option periods of annual (12 month) maintenance support.  This contract was competed on GSA as full and open.  During 2011, immixGroup changed their GSA Schedule Contract from GS-35F0-330J to GS-35F-0265X and the GSA Schedule Contract used to award W81XWH-10-F-0537 which was awarded with a base period and subsequent options.  Since the original Schedule Contract (GS-35F-0330J) is no longer valid as of April 2011, the Government is unable to exercise any options against this Contract and therefore a logical follow-on is requested.  <br><br>Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability as outlined in the below Limited Sources Justification are invited to submit written justification to the assigned Contract Specialist NLT 18 October 2011 at 3PM ET.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability.  Information shall be sent electronically (via e-mail) to Charles Bartlett, Contract Specialist at charles.bartlett@amedd.army.mil.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses will be evaluated; however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the Limited Sources Contract.<br><br>Limited Sources Justification:  Approval is being requested by the TRICARE Management Activity, OCIO Network Operations Program Office for a new EnCase Software Maintenance Support Contract.  Authority Cited:  FAR 8.405-6(a)(i)(C)  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order not previously issued under a sole-source or limited sources procedures.  Reason for Authority Cited:  This action requires the use of the authority cited because the proposed contractor, immixGroup, was previously awarded a GSA Contract under immixGroup's GS-35F-0330J Schedule for Maintenance of EnCase Software in 2010 under Contract W81XWH-10-F-0537.  This Contract was for a 12-month base and multiple 12-month options for annual (12 month) maintenance support.  This contract was competed on GSA as full and open.  During 2011, immixGroup changed their GSA Schedule Contract from GS-35F0-330J to GS-35F-0265X and the GSA Schedule Contract used to award W81XWH-10-F-0537 is no longer current.  Since the original Schedule Contract (GS-35F-0330J) is no longer valid, the Government is unable to exercise any options against this Contract and therefore a logical follow-on is requested.  Efforts to Obtain Competition/Market Research:  Contract W81XWH-10-F-0537 was competed full and open on GSA in September 2010 and although there were at least four (4) vendors with stated capabilities, only one (1) offer was received from the awarded vendor (immixGroup).  Market research was conducted in July 2011 during the course of exercise of option period one of this Contract and again, four vendors were solicited to provide a quote (in an effort to assure the Government was receiving a fair and reasonable price from immixGroup), but only one vendor (immixGroup) responded to the Government's request for quotes.<br><br>

<p>IV. Subsistence and Quarters: Subsistence and quarters of equivalent value thereof may not be credited toward the provision of minimum wages and fringe benefits required herein.</p>
<p>V. This wage determination applies to United States East, West, and Gulf Coasts.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:<br />The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<br />The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<br />REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}<br />Conformance Process:<br />The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<br />The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br />1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br />2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<br />3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br />4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<br />5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<br />6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br />Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (May 2011). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (June 2010), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>

Manufacturing of replacement units is not keeping pace with demand and the result are Aircraft on the Ground (AOG). Adding to the problem is while the NLG is removed and sent for servicing, the aircraft is effectively immobilized taking up valuable hanger space. The F-18 program office has tasked NAVAIRLKE to design and fabricate a DNLG in order to facilitate the movement of the F-18 aircraft while they are waiting for parts status. The Prototype and Manufacturing Department (PMD) at NAVAIRLKE has been tasked to deliver 12 DNLG Assets by TBD. In order to meet that requirement PMD is in need of heat treatment services.<br />Scope:<br />Heat treatment services are needed to increase the strength of the final NLG weldment in accordance with Reference (a) note 6.

Prior to delivery to the contractor, NAWCADLKE will perform a post weld stress relief of 1100 degrees F for no less than 4-hours on each weldment.<br />The scope of work will be identical to that which was accomplished during Proof of Principle process development on Reference (c). Soak time and temperatures will be based on a weldment that is constructed from AISI 4340 alloy steel with varying cross section thicknesses (see Reference a), weighs 300 lbs and has a 49-inch overall length. The heat treatment process shall consist of a salt bath austenitization with hot salt bath marquench accomplished in accordance with Reference (b) with the following execeptions and supplementation:<br />1. Normalize (vacuum atmosphere);<br />2. Sub-critical anneal (vacuum atmosphere);<br />3. Salt bath austenitizing phase to include pre-heat and soak in multiple steps up to final temperature.<br />4. Hot salt bath marquench, minimum bath temperature to be 550 degree F;<br />5. Double temper (nitrogen atmosphere).<br />6. Targeted final hardness is ideal strength v r HRC 35/36 but the final acceptance range is as low as HRC 32.<br />Other Requirements for each production unit:<br />Contractor will visually examine the weldment between each heating cycle to the maximumextent practical to determine if any cracks have developed. Notify NAWCADLKE immediately if cracks have been observed.<br />Heating/cooling rates NTE 200 degree F/hour.<br />Oven charts for each heating cycle to be provided for each phase.<br />Provide results of decarb testing and map locations where testing is done.<br />Report hardness results and map locations where testing is done.<br />At the discretion of NAWCADLKE, an additional 8X10X2-inch thick 4340 coupon may be provided and will occupy same oven time and receive same Q&amp;T as NLG weldment.<br />The contractor will aluminum oxide grit blast the weldment and corrosion protect with Mil-PRF-18173 oil.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific <br />USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Nabil Saimi, PhD ABD, FRM<br />Charg&eacute; de mission / Executive Advisor<br />MASEN - Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy<br />Extention du si&egrave;ge de la CMR<br />Avenue Al Araar, Hay Riad<br />Rabat, Morocco<br />Tel: +212 (0) 661 57 52 34<br />Fax: +212 (0) 537 57 10 17<br /><a href="mailto:saimi@masen.ma">saimi@masen.ma</a></p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for the Morocco: MASEN Concentrated Solar Power Project.</p>
<p>Morocco relies very heavily on imported sources of energy, particularly coal and oil, to meet more than 97% of the country's energy needs. The costs of energy imports strain the country's trade balance and, coupled with subsidies to moderate domestic energy prices, test its capacity to avoid budget deficits. In 2011, Morocco's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to increase by 6.7% (up from the five year average of 5.3%), contributing to the demand for energy that continues to rise by approximately 7% per year while capacity grows at only half that rate.</p>
<p>At the same time, Morocco has vast renewable energy resources that have largely gone untapped, particularly in solar energy. Recognizing the critical need to develop its domestic solar energy base, the Government of Morocco (GOM) launched the national Moroccan Plan for Solar Energy ("Solar Plan") in November 2009, as part of a broader national renewable energy strategy. The Solar Plan calls for developing a minimum of 2GW of solar power generation capacity by 2020. The GOM is highly committed to the development of solar energy and is moving very quickly to implement the Solar Plan.</p>
<p>In March 2010, the GOM established MASEN as the state-owned agency responsible for the development of the Solar Plan. MASEN is jointly owned in equal parts (25%) by the GOM, the National Office of Electricity (ONE), the Moroccan Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the Moroccan Energy Investment Company (SIE) (a sovereign wealth fund dedicated to renewable energy created from privatization proceeds). MASEN's directive is to design and conduct the public procurement processes for Build-Own-Operate-Transfer power plants under an independent power producer (IPP) model with 25 year power purchase agreements (PPA) in different locations within the Moroccan national territory. The government has selected five sites for the Moroccan Solar Plan, with the 500 MW complex near the southern city of Ouarzazate as the first site under development. Ouarzazate will become an operational "test bed" of various solar technologies operated at commercial scale under desert conditions.</p>
<p>After an open tender was conducted by MASEN in 2010, CSP Parabolic Trough technology was selected for Phase I of the 500 MW Ouarzazate complex. One of the subsequent phases of the Ouarzazate complex will be dedicated to CSP Tower technologies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Technical Assistance is to assist MASEN with the design and development of the CSP Tower phase of the Ouarzazate complex.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance will be focused on the development of minimum functional and performance specifications as part of the tender documents for a CSP Tower procurement. In order to prepare the specifications for the tender, the Technical Assistance will include an analysis of existing CSP Tower technologies, most notably, their state of development, benchmarked performance between the different tower technologies and other thermal solar technologies, investment and operational cost, associated risks both during construction and operation, suitability to grid conditions, land requirement, water usage, cooling options and environmental impacts. The Technical Assistance will also provide recommendations on the optimal plant configuration in term of plant size and capacity of integrated storage at a level of detail sufficient to draft the minimum functional and performance specifications for tendering.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $651,886 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, November 10, 2011</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>PURPOSE: <br />The contractor shall furnish all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment (including heavy equipment and snow shovels) to provide efficient snow and ice removal services at the National Weather Service Forecast Office located at 6930 Sand Lake Road, Anchorage, AK. The contractor shall remove snow and ice by plowing, blowing, brushing, sweeping, shoveling, or other suitable means not harmful to the traffic surface as necessary in order to produce and maintain safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles. The contractor shall apply sand, ice melt, etc., as necessary to treat existing or developing unsafe conditions to produce safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles.<br />TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />Before the first snowfall, the contractor will install snow poles to define the edges of the parking lot, roads and fire hydrant. The snow poles will be removed in spring after the last snow has melted. Snow poles and attaching fasteners will be provided by the National Weather Service.<br />Snow removal is expected after a 3 inch accumulation of snowfall or if authorized personnel call for additional snow removal or for an icing problem. Snow and ice removal services will be considered "automatic" and "on-call". It shall be the contractor's responsibility to monitor weather forecasts and conditions and automatically initiate removal services unless an authorized person calls for additional services.<br />All doorways and sidewalks (the full width) will be kept clear of snow and ice. This includes: the sidewalks on the North and West sides of the WFO main building, the sidewalk attached to the main entrance, the sidewalk that connects the WFO main building to the facilities building, and the sidewalk that encircles the generator room. Ice melt will be used to keep the sidewalks from getting slippery from ice or compacted snow.<br />The parking lots, work areas and roadways will be kept free of snow. These areas will also be sanded when they become slippery due to ice or compacted snow.<br />The path to the flagpole needs to be shoveled and kept clear of snow and ice.<br />The dumpster entrance must be kept clear of snow and ice for easy access.<br />The fire hydrant will be kept clear of snow for ease of access.</p>
<p>The work area located on the south and west sides of the facilities building will have the snow removed from all of the level area. The level area extends approximately 45 feet out from the building. The snow will also be cleared from the doorways of the two hazardous material storage sheds located on the west side of the facilities building.</p>
<p>The inflation building has doors on all four sides of the building which need to be kept clear of ice and snow. Two of the doors are roll-up types, one is a standard entrance door and the fourth door is a double door. The level ground around the inflation building needs to be kept clear of snow. The level ground extends in a radius approximately 45 feet around the building. The road to the inflation building and the inflation building doors need to be plowed and cleared before 1:00 am and 1:00pm. This can be done independently of clearing the other areas.</p>
<p>The small gravel road to the NOAA Weather Radio should be cleared of snow.</p>
<p>Snow staking will be at the discretion of the snow removal company when/if the snow storage areas require such.</p>
<p>After the last snowfall has melted in the spring all sand will be swept from the asphalt portions of the parking lots and all sidewalks.</p>
<p>Special Conditions:</p>
<p>1) The door that exists on the south side of the building does not have a sidewalk that leads to the parking lot. If the snow depth exceeds 24 inches - upon special request a path will need to be cleared to the parking lot from this door. The Vendor will be held harmless as to any damage that may occur to the lawn underneath this path. It just needs to be walkable. It does not have to be cleared down to the grass.</p>
<p>2) Whenever the snow begins to melt, a puddle forms on the driveway near the entrance/exit to Sand Lake Road. Extra work is required to keep the south side of the driveway free from ice-damming so proper draining can occur.</p>
<p>3) All doorways and entrance walkways for the WFO main building and facilities building will be kept clear of snow and ice.</p>
<p>4) Snow removal services may include but are not limited to: hand shoveling, hand sweeping, snowplowing by truck, sanding, loader use, snow storage, and application of approved ice melt.</p>

There are differences with distinctions between being qualified and possessing a certification and 4.d does not require "certification." Qualified can be demonstrated through licenses, degrees, advanced degrees, experience, and etc. Below Grade VI, the evaluators will consider what is presented in support of claims as to civil, mechanical, electrical or environmental qualification.&nbsp;</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific <br />USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Nabil Saimi, PhD ABD, FRM<br />Charg&eacute; de mission / Executive Advisor<br />MASEN - Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy<br />Extention du si&egrave;ge de la CMR<br />Avenue Al Araar, Hay Riad<br />Rabat, Morocco<br />Tel: +212 (0) 661 57 52 34<br />Fax: +212 (0) 537 57 10 17<br /><a href="mailto:saimi@masen.ma">saimi@masen.ma</a></p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for the Morocco: MASEN Concentrated Solar Power Project.</p>
<p>Morocco relies very heavily on imported sources of energy, particularly coal and oil, to meet more than 97% of the country's energy needs. The costs of energy imports strain the country's trade balance and, coupled with subsidies to moderate domestic energy prices, test its capacity to avoid budget deficits. In 2011, Morocco's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to increase by 6.7% (up from the five year average of 5.3%), contributing to the demand for energy that continues to rise by approximately 7% per year while capacity grows at only half that rate.</p>
<p>At the same time, Morocco has vast renewable energy resources that have largely gone untapped, particularly in solar energy. Recognizing the critical need to develop its domestic solar energy base, the Government of Morocco (GOM) launched the national Moroccan Plan for Solar Energy ("Solar Plan") in November 2009, as part of a broader national renewable energy strategy. The Solar Plan calls for developing a minimum of 2GW of solar power generation capacity by 2020. The GOM is highly committed to the development of solar energy and is moving very quickly to implement the Solar Plan.</p>
<p>In March 2010, the GOM established MASEN as the state-owned agency responsible for the development of the Solar Plan. MASEN is jointly owned in equal parts (25%) by the GOM, the National Office of Electricity (ONE), the Moroccan Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the Moroccan Energy Investment Company (SIE) (a sovereign wealth fund dedicated to renewable energy created from privatization proceeds). MASEN's directive is to design and conduct the public procurement processes for Build-Own-Operate-Transfer power plants under an independent power producer (IPP) model with 25 year power purchase agreements (PPA) in different locations within the Moroccan national territory. The government has selected five sites for the Moroccan Solar Plan, with the 500 MW complex near the southern city of Ouarzazate as the first site under development. Ouarzazate will become an operational "test bed" of various solar technologies operated at commercial scale under desert conditions.</p>
<p>After an open tender was conducted by MASEN in 2010, CSP Parabolic Trough technology was selected for Phase I of the 500 MW Ouarzazate complex. One of the subsequent phases of the Ouarzazate complex will be dedicated to CSP Tower technologies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Technical Assistance is to assist MASEN with the design and development of the CSP Tower phase of the Ouarzazate complex.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance will be focused on the development of minimum functional and performance specifications as part of the tender documents for a CSP Tower procurement. In order to prepare the specifications for the tender, the Technical Assistance will include an analysis of existing CSP Tower technologies, most notably, their state of development, benchmarked performance between the different tower technologies and other thermal solar technologies, investment and operational cost, associated risks both during construction and operation, suitability to grid conditions, land requirement, water usage, cooling options and environmental impacts. The Technical Assistance will also provide recommendations on the optimal plant configuration in term of plant size and capacity of integrated storage at a level of detail sufficient to draft the minimum functional and performance specifications for tendering.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $651,886 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, November 12, 2011</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Regional Team Leader manages the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team within the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia and Middle East (AME), Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of specific DCHA/OTI country programs in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation. The objectives for this position are to (1) ensure USAID/DCHA/OTI's regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and (2) ensure US government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Regional Team Leader for the Afghanistan/Pakistan team that will fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Regional Team Leader requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Regional Team Leader requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Regional Team Leader is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Regional Team Leader is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Regional Team Leader has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Regional Team Leader is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a central participant on inter- and intra-agency policy and crisis task forces when required;</p>
<p>&bull; Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Service Contract employees;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee and ensure the development of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and evaluate OTI country programs through regular communication with the OTI program staff and implementing partner headquarter staff, the regular review of reports from the field and Washington, liaising with the OTI Program Office team, and regular field site visits;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that field programs are provided support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting Chief of Field Programs Division, or Country Representative in the field in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure staff work objectives and tasks are well defined, and ensure recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise. Ensure staff are highly qualified and trained and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming. Ensure employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets and ensure the Regional Team procurement plan is kept up to date. It is critical to ensure that country programs are appropriately budgeted for. Additional responsibilities include working to secure additional funding from other USG sources if required, and ensuring that the team is trained on all the appropriate systems and tools for budgeting, finances and procurement;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee the design and implementation of new country program operations to include complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries, including the effective oversight of management, logistical, budget, administrative, human resources, and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with lower and higher-ranking USAID and other U.S. Government officials, OTI country program strategies and determine appropriate USAID funding levels and requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee, develop and/or manage, in conjunction with the OTI Washington staff and OTI country representative in the field, an OTI close-out strategy that will, wherever appropriate and possible, ensure reasonable and effective hand-over to follow-on USAID and/or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State and other USG agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate and communicate with other DCHA, USAID, State Department, Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agency personnel in Washington and the field; cooperating country Government officials; United Nations organizations; the World Bank; and host country and international NGOs;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate regular DCHA/OTI reports to U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Lead and manage the Regional Team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of Program Manager staff in Washington and Country Representatives in the field, as well as Implementing Partner grants and agreements at the headquarter level. (Note that OTI Country Representatives in the field directly supervise additional field staff, and responsibility for managing implementing partners at the headquarter level may be delegated to trained Program Manager staff in Washington.); and,</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor other OTI Team Leaders, and mentor and train Country Representatives and Program Managers as required.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Team Leader will take direction from and will report to the Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of counternarcotics issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Repiublic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to ensure a comprehensive approach to the drug problem. The U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan targets narcotics traffickers through interdiction, while also supporting agricultural development, eradication, demand reduction, public information, and rule of law programs throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Counternarcotics Advisor will support, assist, and advise INL in its efforts to expand counternarcotics programs in Regional Command-West (RC(W)), based in Herat. The Counternarcotics Advisor would provide expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist GIRoA in reaching its stated goals and objectives in reforming the counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. S/he would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include counternarcotics policy development and coordination with the interagency and international community and counternarcotics program development, management, and oversight.</p>
<p>I. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />&bull; Serves as INL counternarcotics advisor in the area covered by the Regional Command (RC), as directed by INL or the Senior Civilian Representative in the RC. As directed, coordinate with State, the Regional Command, USAID, USDA, international partners, and provide advice to Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and Regional Platforms on counternarcotics matters.</p>
<p>&bull; Aid in ensuring lines of communication between INL/Kabul, DEA, USAID, U.S./ISAF military, the GOA, and other international partners on counternarcotics programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Acquire a good knowledge and understanding of activity under all eight pillars of the GIRoA counternarcotics effort, as well as an understanding of how the counternarcotics effort is linked with counterinsurgency, anti-corruption, and rule of law efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulations and implementation of policies/programs at the local and regional level.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with conducting program development, implementation, and oversight for new and existing INL counternarcotics programs, including, but not limited to working with Provincial Development Councils to develop proposals for Good Performers Initiative programs, Governor-Led Eradication, the Counternarcotics Public Information, and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. Also, aid in the solicitation and delivery of resources and funding from third party sources (for example UK Embassy, ISAF, CSTC-A).</p>
<p>&bull; As directed, work with relevant partners from the Office of the Governor, GIRoA Line Ministries, and provincial and district leadership to advance shared interests in counternarcotics.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in tracking counternarcotics and related developments in the area of responsibility, including CN efforts by partner entities including the civilian and military counternarcotics efforts and USAID alternative development efforts in the province, among others. As appropriate, facilitate and promote counternarcotics engagement and assistance to the provinces within the RC by other international parties, including the United Nations and Coalition member states.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate visits to the RC for GIRoA counternarcotics officials and visiting INL, Embassy, and State Department delegations.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with providing regular reporting on developments in the field to INL/Kabul, INL/Washington, the State Department Senior Civilian Representative in the RC, and INL counternarcotics advisors and program officers elsewhere in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; As necessary and directed, serve as general INL Liaison at the RC, connecting RC-based officers with relevant INL staff in Kabul, the rest in Afghanistan, and Washington.</p>
<p>&bull; Work effectively under pressure, within short time constraints, and during times of rapidly developing events. <br />&bull; Work collaboratively and effectively with senior leadership and colleagues from other countries, agencies, and departments to accomplish INL's goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform INL on current developments in a given portfolio that must be consulted in advance of important briefings, meetings, or presentations of new initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; Produce a brief written weekly report on status of programs, activities, and initiatives to be disseminated via email to designated points of contact at INL Kabul, and INL/AP on a mutually agreed upon day of the week. Upon reporting to post, propose a format for this report, which should include, but is not limited to: recent and planned activities, accomplishments, challenges, proposed solutions, administrative issues, and upcoming schedule (to include TDYs and leave). Photographs may be included, as well.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of various letters of authorization and memoranda of understanding between the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan, as well as existing federal regulations, Department of State policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of INL policies and programs, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated. The work horizon of this position is one year; the incumbent must actively plan activities twelve months into the future. Active planning involves anticipating future events and requirements, deciding or recommending what needs to be done, the people and other resources required, and the timing of the activities. <br />Operating within the country strategy, the incumbent will have ongoing opportunity to develop new ideas and approaches that impact on existing procedures and methods. The incumbent must absorb and understand a large volume of detailed information on policies and procedures for multiple disciplines. Within a loose framework, the incumbent will be responsible for meeting a series of mid-to-long term objectives through structuring work and resources. Often breaking new ground, this role will be highly complex and will require a highly developed analytical ability and judgment. The problems encountered in this position are often unique, highly complex, or conceptual. Covering a wide range of potentially conflicting issues, the incumbent must apply the highest analytical skill and judgment to determine the best solution from the range of possible alternatives. The work pattern will be typified by many different overlapping tasks with heavy disruption due to changes in priorities, external events, and other interruptions<br />The incumbent will interface primarily with mid-level officers inside the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and other international representatives at PRTs and civilian platforms in Afghanistan. The nature of the contact with embassy officers will be highly demanding, requiring the transfer of complex ideas and concepts. The incumbent will interact primarily with mid-level military, GOA, and international officials, although the advisor will sometimes meet with the governor of the province to which assigned. The nature of the contact will normally be routine, although often escalating to complex as competing/conflicting interests and security threats are encountered.<br />A broad range of highly developed oral communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy, provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, give formal presentations, express care and compassion, provide reasoned arguments, and resolve conflicts without compromising the organization's position. Finally, the incumbent must exercise leadership, in order to achieve objectives and get the job done well, quickly, and efficiently without recourse to close supervision or coercion.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites may rarely be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>II. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>a. U.S. citizenship, eligible for a State Department Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. The incumbent should possess a university degree in a field related to the primary duties of this position. Examples include: International Affairs, International Development, Political Science; South/Southwest Asia, Middle East, Asian or Islamic Studies; Business Administration and/or finance; and Development Economics. A master's degree is preferred but not required.<br />c. A total of ten years of professional work experience directly related to one or more of the fields related to the primary duties of the position: program management, international development, public diplomacy/public information campaigns, agriculture or alternative livelihood assistance. NOTE: A SECURITY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT OF THIS POSITION. <br />d. International experience is required; experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. <br />e. Knowledge Areas<br />i. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of INL programs, civilian and military planning, and applications to counternarcotics goals in the geographic area where assigned. The incumbent will be expected to give detailed advice on how these areas operate<br />ii. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of the political situation; social, cultural, religious, economic, and legal frameworks; security situation; and the agricultural, infrastructural (roads, bridges, irrigation, etc.), counternarcotics strategy in his/her geographic area of assignment<br />iii. The incumbent should possess, at the time of assignment, detailed knowledge of at least one (but preferably at least two) of the following fields: counternarcotics policy, counternarcotics-related law enforcement, justice sector development, public information, agriculture livelihood development, economic livelihood development, alternative livelihood development, and/or drug demand reduction/treatment.<br />iv. Specialist knowledge may have been acquired through extensive training in the specialist area(s), through a considerable amount of work experience in the field, or a combination of the two. Due to this background, the incumbent will be influential within the entire program and will likely provide detailed advice to non-specialist and other specialists.<br />f. Any degree of fluency in Pashto or Dari is desired, as is experience in working with an interpreter.<br />g. A range of written communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information to other international advisors through e-mail and fax, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy with the international community in both formal and informal letters and e-mails, as well as provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, and resolve conflicts in a written format without compromising the organization's position. <br />III. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent will directly report to the Director of the INL Section (INL/Kabul) at U.S. Embassy Kabul through the INL/Kabul Counternarcotics Team Leader. The Department of State Senior Civilian Representative in Kandahar will provide daily supervision. Tasking will come from both INL/Kabul and INL's Afghanistan and Pakistan Program Office in Washington. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend four (4) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Life Support: Life support for the Advisor will be provided by other USG service providers and is not to be included in this task order proposal. INL/INL Kabul will provide the incumbent with access to the Embassy compound. The incumbent will have access to hardened and/or regular cars (exact type will be dependent on the security situation) from motor pool for transportation. Housing will be assigned through the Embassy's PRT Office in coordination with INL and the PRT Commander.</p>

<AWARDEE>The Lewin Group, 3130 FAIRVIEW PARK DRIVE STE 8, FALLS CHURCH, VA 22042-4517 US
<DESC><p>Acquisition and Objectives</p>
<p>This modification is to add new work to an existing task order titled "Design of a Demonstration of Housing with Services to Enhance Aging in Place for Older Adults". For administrative convenience this logical follow-on is being processed as a modification to the existing task order.</p>
<p>The added tasks are within scope of the master PSC IDIQ contract. The contractor will research and design a demonstration to test whether coordinated health care and long-term services and supports for older residents in subsidized housing can promote independent living and potentially reduce unnecessary medical and long-term care expenses. This information is critical to address the increasing needs of an aging population and to explore potential ways to reducing avoidable hospitalizations or premature institutionalization (e.g. nursing homes).</p>
<p>Project Background</p>
<p>The task order "Design of a Demonstration of Coordinated Housing, Health and Long-Term Services and Supports for Low-Income Older Adults" was awarded in 2010. It will result in options for the design of a demonstration of targeted, coordinated housing, health, and long-term services and supports for older adults. The project will examine the use of administrative and other data to target the appropriate places and individuals for such a service delivery model.</p>
<p>This design of a demonstration will allow the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and the Administration on Aging (AoA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to determine how congregate housing might be coupled with targeted, coordinated health and long-term services and supports to help certain older adults age better and longer in the community, while promoting efficient service delivery.</p>
<p>The work will build on what is known about existing, related service models and include a pilot to test the feasibility of matching HUD and HHS administrative data to better inform our understanding of the relationship between supported housing, health, and long-term services and supports. Based on this pilot, the project will also include a data analysis plan for using existing data to develop targeting tools for such housing and services programs.</p>
<p>Work this year on the tasks of the "Design of a Demonstration of Coordinated Housing, Health and Long-Term Services and Supports for Low-Income Older Adults" has been going well. However, unexpected issues have arisen that require additional resources to complete the design of the demonstration.</p>
<p>Specifically, there were a few key variables not available in the summary files used for the initial HHS-HUD data match. These variables include key information such as emergency room use, EMT use, and hospital observation days. We now expect that we could obtain these variables through complementary HHS data projects. These variables represent key areas of health care utilization that we expect a model of coordinated housing with services could affect-- potentially reducing both Medicare and Medicaid costs, as well as improving client health. Conducting multivariate analysis of the merged data with this fuller set of variables will enable us to better examine and understand the relationship between HUD subsidized housing in our case study locations and health care utilization.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have the need for information related to direct program costs in order to refine final demonstration options. Refinements will require gathering follow-up information from existing sites as well as visits to three additional sites identified (by the technical advisory group) as innovative in their approaches care delivery, financing, and integration of services. This requires additional effort being added to existing task 7.3.</p>
<p>Due to this additional work, the period of performance for this project requires an additional six months. This will allow for time to conduct further data analysis, carry out the additional site visits, and integrate the findings into a final demonstration design report.</p>
<p>Project Description</p>
<p>The current task order will design a demonstration to test whether coordinated health care and long-term services and supports for older residents in subsidized housing can promote independent living and potentially reduce unnecessary medical and long-term care expenses.</p>
<p>The current work on Task 6 (Data Linkage and Analysis Plan) requires more work to inform the design options. Furthermore, through work done under the existing task order, three additional models have emerged that offer elements of a potential approach. This requires three additional site visits being added to Task 7.3 (Conduct Site Visits).</p>
<p>This modification will change the existing task order by:<br />&bull; Adding subtask 6.4 "Analysis of Linked HUD-HHS Data"<br />&bull; Modifying Subtask 7.3 Conduct Site visits by adding<br />o 3 additional sites, and<br />o "programmatic cost information" to the set of information being covered in site visits, and <br />&bull; Extending the end date of the contract from May 4, 2012 to December 31, 2012<br />These activities are non-severable and will culminate with a final demonstration design report to inform policy and research activities at both the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>Requirement Type: Support Services (Non-R&amp;D)<br />Type of Action: Follow On<br />Contract Type: Firm Fixed Price<br />Total dollar value and performance/delivery period: Value: $193,048.00<br />Period of Performance: The task order started on September 30, 2010. This modification will extend the period of performance from May 4, 2012 to December 31, 2012.</p>
<p>The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>The pricing for this logical follow-on will be in accordance with the Lewin Group's master PSC IDIQ contract. These prices were negotiated at the time of award and found to be fair and reasonable. Additionally, the COTR will review the number of labor hours, labor mix and other direct costs to confirm whether they are consistent with the proposed technical solution for the additional work. Therefore, it was determined by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2010 task order was released through the PSC IDIQ. The contractor's project team has unique and necessary qualifications. In addition to the foundational tasks in the existing task order, the Contractor's project team is composed of preeminent experts on affordable housing with services for older adults.</p>

<DESC>MICC ICO FC has an immediate need to exercise an option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend services for one month under the current CONUS Base Support Service (CSBS) contract, W9124D-09-C-9000 (although styled as a contract, this document is actually a task order issued under a CSBS enterprise multiple award indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contract).   On 26 September 2011, TechWise, an unsuccessful offeror in the competition for the successor contract for CSBS, submitted a post-award AMC-Level protest against the award to Eagle Support Services (Eagle).  In accordance with FAR 52.233-3 and the AMC-Level Protest Procedures, a stop-work order was issued to Eagle, precluding it from starting services under the new contract on 1 October 2011, as scheduled.  AMC has indicated that it will issue a decision in the protest by 25 October 2011.
