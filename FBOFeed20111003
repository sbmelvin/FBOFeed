COORDINATION:
The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving  projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, and policies.
SPECIALIZED SERVICES:
In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, our office occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the sub consultant, the NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services. The NPS does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub consultant's services.
TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of NPS personnel based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:
A.	Engineering & Design:  Demonstrated professional qualifications, technical expertise, and experience in developing integrated designs, specifications, and cost estimates for projects in a multidisciplinary environment.  Emphasis will be on experience in sustainable designs that minimize the use of non-renewable resources through water and energy conservations; that use alternative energy sources, recycled content materials and recovered materials; that promote low life cycle costs, pollution prevention and waste reduction; and that possess good constructability and ease of operation and maintenance.  Demonstrated qualifications of key project staff responsible for integrated design including professional accreditation, registration, licensure, certifications and training.  
B.	Project Management and Construction Administration:  Demonstrated project management and contract administration experience and expertise with integrated design with an emphasis in coordinating a multidisciplinary team of internal and external resources.  Demonstrated ability of the firm and its sub consultants to successfully communicate, coordinate, facilitate, and work expeditiously with Federal, state, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals.  Demonstrated ability of the firm and its sub consultants to manage and maintain scope of work, budgets, and schedules without sacrificing quality of product or deliverables.
C.

<DESC>Previous solicitation number SAQMMA11R0021 was cancelled on September 27, 2011. This pre-solicitation notice and subsequent solicitation will be used to solicit required services. <br /><br />
<p>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Mission Peru. The U.S. Mission Peru requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site no later than October 7, 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately 15 days. Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 30 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>A site visit was previously held for cancelled solicitation SAQMMA11R0021 in September 2011. The Government determined that a second site visit was not necessary, due the cancellation and reissuance of this solicitation. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The project is bounded on the west by Sahuaro Road, the north by Esperanza Avenue, and the south by an arroyo. Due to the small size of the town of Ajo, CBP needs to make housing available to their personnel in order to meet its mission at this location.</p>
<p>The project includes (but is not limited to) the design and construction of all grading, drainage, underground utilities (water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, gas (if required), electricity, telephone, CATV, internet), streets, and sidewalks street lighting for approximately 46 modular, or stick-built, housing units on 11.61 acres. In addition a Common Area consisting of a 600sf playground, and 6 picnic tables, each with a shade structure, picnic table and barbecue pit shall be included. Design Build Bridging Documents (DBBD) is in development and will be issued with the Request for Proposals (RFP) in Phase Two of this procurement.</p>

A maximum of five (5) firms will be selected for consideration for Phase Two - Request for Proposal (RFP). The short list will be based on the firms' submittals in response to the Phase One - RFQ. The Phase Two - RFP submission is the basis of making the final selection. Those firms included in Phase Two will be required to prepare fully developed technical and price proposals. The Government will not allow any stipend for preparation of proposals. Offerors can be a partnership, corporation, association, and/or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility for the project. A proposed joint venture must provide profiles for all firms in the joint venture.</p>
<p>This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.

Work may also be performed at other Federal Facilities outside the above-stated geographical boundary on an excepted basis as determined by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>**THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION** The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of knee pad designs and material solutions that provide significant durability improvement in the Enhanced Flame Resistant Combat Ensemble (FRCE). The knee area of the FRCE trouser is often the first location that shows wear during use.  The knees abrade after wear in harsh combat and training environments. The USMC seeks to improve / maximize the performance of the FRCE through the identification of materials and knee pad designs that meet requirements and characteristics outlined below. The intention of this RFI is to investigate potential material solutions as well as integrated and removable knee pads.  See the attached RFI notice for more information.

<DESC>Background: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, train, monitor and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers conduct&not;ing intervention trials and other research on treatment, prevention, diagno&not;sis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infec&not;tion and disease in pediatric, adoles&not;cent, and maternal patient popula&not;tions, including both domestic and international clinical sites. The NICHD is interested in identifying whether there any interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to serve as the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Studies Coordinating Center. The Coordinating Center contract currently manages a network of 35 clinical research sites throughout the United States (25) and in Latin America (10) that participate in studies through multiple research networks.
<p>Purpose of this Announcement: This is a Small Business Sources sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The proposed acquisition will involve the following types of activities:</p>
<p>1. Serve as the coordinating center for all aspects of management and monitoring of clinical research sites in the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network. Sites are currently located in the US and Latin America and may also be located in Africa, Asia and other regions during the project period.</p>
<p>The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network ("NICHD Network") has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987. The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women. The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network and Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN), the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC), and Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 25 centers, located in 18 cities, in 10 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are ten international clinical trials sites: nine sites in different areas of Brazil, and one in Argentina. It is anticipated that network sites will be recompeted in 2014 and will potentially include sites in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe in addition to Latin America and the United States. NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials. The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols. The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.</p>
<p>2. Perform Site Monitoring of Phase III NICHD-Funded Investigator Initiated International trials in pregnant and non-pregnant women, infants, children and adolescents.</p>
<p>As the NICHD international research grant portfolio has increased to include large phase III clinical trials conducted in resource-limited countries, there is an increasing need to ensure that such investigator-initiated trials are conducted ethically, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, and with attention to human subject safety. The Coordinating Center will conduct site monitoring for selected NICHD grantees conducting large clinical trials to ensure appropriate trial conduct.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance is five years beginning in about December 2012.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information: The NICHD is seeking Small Businesses capable of meeting the following criteria. Small Business organizations must submit Capability Statements in response to this notice and that will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise:</p>
<p>1. The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Studies Coordinating Center requires the ability of the contractor to effectively and flexibly run a very large and complex multi-center international and domestic clinical trials network that implements and manages studies in collaboration with multiple other networks (with the ability to make appropriate modification of data collection and submission to match that of other networks). <br />2. The contractor must be capable of managing over $30 million in subcontracts with multiple clinical sites, laboratories and other agencies (such as shipping agencies).<br />3. The contractor must have the ability and capacity, as demonstrated by prior experience, to monitor an average of 30 network clinical trials at multiple domestic and international trials sites as well as monitor selected investigator initiated clinical trials. <br />4. The contractor must be able to manage at least 50 simultaneous subcontracts. <br />5. The successful Coordinating Center contractor will have to immediately (within 30 days following contract award) assume ongoing clinical trials work at multiple U.S. and international sites. Thus, an applicant must demonstrate the ability and capacity that they can immediately (within 30 days following contract award) assume responsibility to support 50 subcontracts valued at over $30 million.<br />6. The contractor will be required to support data systems that interface and interact with data systems used by at least 3 different networks using different data management systems (the AACTG, ATN and IMPAACT). <br />7. Since the Coordinating Center will manage and monitor clinical trials conducted in highly vulnerable populations - neonates, children, adolescents and pregnant women - that require specific knowledge of federal regulations related to research in these populations and knowledge of the unique characteristics of such populations when conducting research, the contractor is required to have substantial prior experience with HIV-related studies in these populations in order to immediately assume the work of the Coordinating Center. <br />8. The contractor must demonstrate the ability and have prior experience in training, monitoring and management of clinical trials in the United States and in low-resource settings in Africa, Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p>9. The Contractor must be able to provide personnel, facilities, and other services necessary to maintain and coordinate clinical treatment, prevention, natural history, epidemiologic, and diagnostic research studies at participating centers of studies conducted within the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Studies Coordinating Center contract.</p>
<p>10. The Contractor must be able to continue the research studies within the NICHD Network described above in addition to new studies requested and approved by NICHD.</p>
<p>11. The Contractor must be able to provide through subcontracts the clinical trial sites and laboratory servic&not;es, including drafting, negotiating, executing, administering, monitoring, renewing and/or modifying as needed subcontracts with all current partici&not;pating sites and laboratories (domestic and international) and any new clinical centers or laborato&not;ries as designated by NICHD, and provide support for subcontracted clinical and laboratory centers of the NICHD network.</p>
<p>12. The Contractor must be able to provide services to assure regulatory compliance for research activ&not;ities of sites subcontracted by Coordinating Center for performance of aforementioned studies, including maintaining a communications system in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for the submission of Adverse Experience Reports; plans for acquisition, dis&not;tri&not;bution, dispensing, handling, administration, and accountability of study drugs; site monitoring for quality assurance of research con&not;ducted at all subcontracted clinical and laboratory sites and for selected international clinical trials</p>
<p>13. The Contractor must be able to provide clinical and statistical analysis services, including scientific, techni&not;cal, and administrative support for the development, implementa&not;tion, and analysis of the specified research, development of data elements and forms, ensure timely and accurate data collection, central data entry, data quality assurance, retrieval of source documentation, and genera&not;tion of data and safety monitoring reports; training for staff of subcontracted clinical and laborato&not;ry centers in data management proce&not;dures; provision for data input, editing, electronic data storage, data&not;base management, data retrieval, and statistical analysis; electronic data transmission and electronic mail transmission between Contractor, subcon-tracted clinical and laboratory centers, and collaborating Statis&not;tical and Data Analysis Center databases.</p>
<p>14. The Contractor must be able to provide services for implementation and monitoring of clinical tri&not;als. at all participating NICHD clinical and laboratory centers and for selected international clinical trials; assuring compliance by sites with all requirements for protocol implementa&not;tion, including IRB review and approval prior to protocol initia&not;tion, patient consent and confidenti&not;ality require&not;ments, and Federal bioresearch regula&not;tions and requirements for security and confiden&not;tiality of research records, and that each relevant clinical site staff member completes annual human subjects training; developing site-specific, protocol-specific budget for each protocol ; training for staff of subcontracted clinical and labo&not;ra&not;to&not;ry centers in procedures for implementation and conduct of specific protocols.</p>
<p>15. The Contractor must be able to provide services for development and review of new and ongoing re&not;search activities, including a protocol development team and protocol development plan; draft and edit protocols; maintain necessary documentation for application submissions in compliance with FDA requirements; support for the planning and conduct of meetings of proto&not;col committees and subcommittees, data and safety monitoring boards, and investigators; administrative, technical, and logistical support for research activities.</p>
<p>16. The Contractor must be able to provide consultants with specialized expertise related to clinical trial efforts, as required by NICHD.</p>

<SUBJECT>Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program
<SOLNBR>NOT-NHLBI-HV-13-00
<RESPDATE>112111
<CONTACT>Paul D McFarlane, Contracting Officer, Email nhlbivita@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC><p>Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHBLI) is seeking feedback from potential Offerors and other interested parties relative to initiation of a new product development program. This is a special notice in advance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation planned to be issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The Government is not obligated to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.</p>
<p>The new program, named "VITA", is intended to provide funding for early-stage translational development of product candidates in the fields of vascular and lymphatic disorders, thrombotic diseases, and pulmonary hypertension. This may include, but is not limited to, conditions under the Mission of NHLBI such as: peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vascular disorders, venous and arterial thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, and disorders of the lymphatic system. Not included as specific topics in this program are diseases of the coronary and intracranial arteries.</p>
<p>In the context of the VITA program, the term "product candidate" is used to refer to new diagnostics, new therapeutic agents, or novel applications of existing agents and/or therapeutic interventions. The product(s) under study and development can include, but are not limited to: small molecules, small peptides, proteins or antibodies, devices, diagnostic tests, genetic markers, and cell or gene agents.</p>
<p>The VITA program is designed to fund proposals that fall under one of two broad early stages of product development: 1) proposals seeking support for work in the window between principle discovery and the demonstration and confirmation of "proof of principle"(POP) in the form of various preclinical efficacy assessments and preliminary safety evaluations, and 2) proposals for further development and testing of product candidates with demonstrated proof of principle, such as studies to support an IND or IDE application.</p>
<p>This contract will be open to all Offerors with a product candidate in the applicable medical fields regardless of institutional affiliation or prior product development experience. Awards in either stage will be up to three years in duration and project funding through the VITA Program does not preclude supplemental outside funding from academia or the private sector on that same project. The VITA contract program will also support a separate Program Coordinating Center (PCC) that will provide project management, meeting coordination, and regulatory advice for funded Offerors who require such services. However, this Request For Information (RFI) is not seeking information from parties interested in the PCC; rather responses should come only from parties interested in the described product development.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NHLBI has identified "opportunity gaps" for two stages of translation: (1) between the conceptualization of potential medical advances and the experimental validation of those concepts as medical product candidates, and (2) between the demonstration of proof of principle and the completion of studies required for the assessment of a product candidate in human clinical trials. As part of its mission to improve the health of the American public, NHLBI is establishing the VITA Program to stimulate the advancement of medical product development in these two specific opportunity gaps.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND POINTS OF CONSIDERATION</p>
<p>NHBLI invites interested parties with potential product candidates in the designated applicable medical fields to respond to the questions listed below.</p>
<p>1. Contact Information - Provide name and email address and employment affiliation related to your product candidate. (This is optional, but inclusion of your contact information ensures that you will be informed about any updates regarding this solicitation.)</p>
<p>2. Within the scope of disease conditions listed above for the VITA Program , what unmet medical need(s) will your proposed product candidate(s) address? (max. 250 words)</p>
<p>3. Describe your product candidate and how it will address the unmet medical need(s) to benefit public health. (max. 250 words)</p>
<p>4. Please describe the current state of development of your proposed product candidate(s). Which stage of the VITA Program ("Principle to POP" or "POP to IND/IDE") would be most appropriate for your proposed product candidate(s)? (max. 250 words)</p>
<p>5. Please describe your own level of experience with product development. Other than additional funding, what kind of additional resources and/or expertise are needed in order to advance your product candidate(s) toward human clinical evaluation? (max. 250 words)<br />RESPONSE GUIDELINES</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is covered under the Privacy Act System of Records 09-25-0156, "Records of Participants in Programs and Respondents in Surveys Used to Evaluate Programs of the Public Health Service, HHS/PHS/NIH/OD."</p>
<p>This RFI is for collecting information to improve the planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a grant or contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI. Nor does it otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. All responses will be regarded as confidential. No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent announcement. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any related future solicitations. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any proprietary information should be so marked. NHLBI appreciates your input.</p>
<p>Responses should include this Notice identifier NOT-NHLBI-HV-13-00 and are due no later than 4 PM EST, Monday, November 21, 2011.</p>
<p>Updates and additional information will be available on a website, which is currently under development. A link to the VITA initiative website will be sent to those who respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this request for information may be directed to Paul D. McFarlane, Contracting Officer, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health<br />E-mail: <a href="mailto:NHLBIVITA@NHLBI.NIH.GOV">NHLBIVITA@NHLBI.NIH.GOV</a></p>

In addition, Z-MAR Technology (CAGE 0YWL3) has been designated by the 402<sup>nd</sup> Electronics Maintenance Group as the central procurement source for Electro-static bags in accordance with MILSTRIP standards. Z-MAR has also been able to manufacture and delivery these bags in an expedient manner.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. <br />(i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) occupies a 2.5 million square foot leased campus in Alexandria, Virginia. The campus was constructed with a major focus on creating redundancies in power to support Data Center operations. The USPTO assumed full occupancy of the campus between 2003 and 2005.
<p>As part of the initial construction, the lease stipulated that the campus be supported by two different power feeds and two rotary UPS systems so that the critical load of the Data Center equipment could be supported without any delay. See Attachment 1 for an excerpt from the lease.</p>
<p>In July, one of the Piller units failed. Since then, the USPTO has been relying on one Piller unit, without redundancy. The USPTO requires a dedicated generator and UPS to be attached and synchronized to the existing units to protect the Data Center equipment from any power outages.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide and install an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) and 4000AMP switchgear and a 900KW rotary UPS for critical power switchgear. The essential power switchgear should be fed from a rental switchboard directly, as the HVAC load does not require a UPS support.</p>
<p>The units shall be placed at the 600 Dulany Street East Loading Dock, preferably in the dock, or the adjacent parking pad. This location contains an existing underground diesel tank and is approximately twenty feet from two designated disconnect switches within the loading dock.</p>
<p>This generator will be utilized for a 12-to-14-hour period on the earliest possible Saturday in October, when the functional Piller is taken off-line for assessment. Thereafter, the rental UPS/generator will remain in place but not utilized, unless there is a disruption in the main power feed. The rental UPS system shall provide "no-blink" capability for the essential feed and to allow the generator adequate time to begin.</p>
<p>Detailed coordination must be completed with Piller in order to adequately synchronize the units, through USPTO, and through our lessor, LCOR.</p>
<p>Given concerns about the noise of the operating unit, noise-reducing enclosure and mufflers are required.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for providing the rental units and coordinating the design and installation with both Piller and the Lessor, LCOR, to insure that the USPTO's Data Center is fully protected in the event of a power outage.</p>
<p>See attachment for full quote instructions, terms and conditions.</p>

Specific steps taken by the Corps to comply with these laws "... assure that Federal plans and programs contribute to the preservation and enhancement of non-federally owned sites, structures, and objects of historical, architectural, or archaeological significance." A part of that responsibility is to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all such sites in the project area that appear to qualify for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-add-space: auto">2.2a The Phase I investigation includes a surface survey of exposed shoreline areas to relocate previously identified sites, identify new sites, and assess the current condition of these sites (Figure 1). One previous investigation, completed by Hudak in 1981, encompassed the entire Orwell Lake and Dam boundaries and resulted in the identification of four sites. One site, mound group 21OT82 was relocated in Strachan &amp; Roetzel's 1986 report but was partially inundated and could only be reached by boat. Since these investigations, no further investigation of site 21OT82 or other sites has been conducted.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-add-space: auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-add-space: auto">2.2b The current condition of previously identified sites along the reservoir need to be assessed. This Phase I investigation is dependent upon water level since some previously recorded sites were identified as being impacted by erosion as well as some sites being identified as inundated.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-add-space: auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-add-space: auto">2.2c The Phase II evaluation includes a more intensive testing of the previously identified site 21OT80 at Orwell Lake and Dam to determine whether the site is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Site 21OT80 was first identified in a Phase I field investigation conducted by Hudak in 1981and is located on a peninsula approximately 1.6 miles west of Orwell Dam. It includes the NW &frac14;, SE &frac14; of Section 25, Township 132 north, Range 44 west, Otter Tail County, Minnesota (Figure 2 &amp; 3). The Phase II investigation will include shovel testing and a minimum of four 1x1 m test units in order to potentially identify the site boundaries and determine its eligibility for the NRHP. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">If conditions at 21OT80 are such that a Phase II is not practicable (e.g., the site is no longer extant), the Contractor will consult with the Contracting Officer and a new site at the reservoir will be selected for a Phase II evaluation.</span></p>

<p>I. Requirements of the RFQ (CLINs, PWS and all attachments) and Government standards and regulations pertaining to the PWS.</p>
<p>End of 52.212-1 addendum.<br /><br />2. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 12.602(A) AND FAR 13.106-2, THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED:</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive solicitation for quotations utilizing Best Value procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13. As outlined in the addenda to FAR 52.212-1, the evaluation factors of price and technical capability will be utilized by the Government in making an award determination.</p>
<p>B. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) vendor. The Government shall make a determination of technical acceptability, based upon meeting the salient performance characteristics of the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>C. Options. The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base year. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>D. Award Determination. Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive that reflects a complete understanding of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>3. In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations. The following information is provided in regards to quotations:</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; A quotation is not an offer and consequently cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies and/or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing.</p>
<p>In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies and/or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
<p>If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC>The solicitation is hereby amended to respond to questions submitted, incorporate changes to the requirements, change the line item schedule, and incorporate changes to the required submissions as follows:

1. Questions and Answers:

Question: Does NIST have photos of the waste matrices?

Answer: No, photos are not available

Question: Does NIST have any preliminary characterization data available for review?

Answer:  This information  has been provided in the solicitation (isotopes and approximate contamination level).

Question: Does NIST have photos and specification documents for the B-25 boxes?

Answer: No Photos shall be provided, however, they can be viewed at the suppliers website http://www.c-p-c.com/products/B-25.html . NIST has IP-1 certification papers, and drawings for the boxes, which shall be provided upon award of a purchase order.

Question: In reference to Line Item 0001, are the referenced weights the gross amount or the net amounts of material being shipped for disposal?

Answer: The weights are gross weights, inclusive of the weights of the B-25 boxes

Question: Can NIST verify that all of the B-25 boxes will be able to ship on one truck?

Answer: NIST anticipates that two (2) flat-bed tractor trailer trucks shall be necessary. These can be schedule to depart the same day, therefore; only one (1) day on-site would be required for the brokerage/shipping agent

Question:  The RFQ makes several references to Line Items 0001 & 0002. However, there is only Line Item 0001listed within the RFQ?  How many line items are there?

Answer:  The solicitation has been amended to include Line Item 0001 and Line Item 0002.  Reference the changes to requirements herein. 

Question:  Has a Hub zone set-aside be considered for this requirement?

Answer: This is not a Hub-zone set-aside, it is a small business set-aside.  All timely responses, from  responsible small businesses, shall be considered.  

Question: Would a time and materials price quotation be considered?

Answer:  The requirement is for a firm-fixed price quotation, a time and materials quotation is not acceptable. 

Question: Can you further explain the requirement The Contractor shall take title to the B-25 boxes? This remains a grey area and open for interpretation.

Answer:  The Contractor shall decontaminate the interior surfaces of the boxes and take ownership of them.  Any resultant waste from this Contractor decontamination effort shall be disposed of by the Contractor.  The boxes were new when loaded, and any contamination on the inside surfaces of the boxes will be a small fraction of what was on the exterior surfaces of the loaded contents.  The pipe sections, etc. were drained and essentially dry when loaded, they have been stuffed with wipes into the open pipe ends, etc.  Therefore, the potential contamination levels on the box interiors are expected to be low. The box interior surfaces are new, flat and non-porous steel, which will facilitate decontamination.  NIST understands that under Federal Law, NIST agrees that NIST will remain the generator of the waste forever. The Contractor is responsible for disposal of the radioactive materials in accordance with NRC 10CFR Ch.61.Para55, Class A LRW. 

2.  The following changes to the requirements are hereby incorporated: 

FROM:
The Contractor shall take title to the B-25 boxes, and shall base all quoted pricing on the not-to- exceed (nte) gross loaded weights of B-25 boxes as specified in line items 0001 & 0002.

TO:
The Contractor shall take ownership of, decontaminate the B-25 boxes, and shall base all quoted pricing on the not-to- exceed (nte) gross loaded weights of B-25 boxes as specified in line item 0001& 0002.  It is expected that any contamination on the interiors of the boxes will be removable by wiping with standard spray cleaners and wipes. 
The Contractor shall decontaminate the interior surfaces of the boxes and take ownership of them.

The boxes were new when loaded, and any contamination on the inside surfaces of the boxes will be a small fraction of what was on the exterior surfaces of the loaded contents.  The pipe sections, etc. were drained and essentially dry when loaded, they have been stuffed with wipes into the open pipe ends, etc.  Therefore, the potential contamination levels on the box interiors are expected to be low.

The Contractor is responsible for disposal of the radioactive materials in accordance with NRC 10CFR Ch.61.Para55, Class A LLRW.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Lakehurst, NJ, intends to competitively procure the A/F27T-10 Hydraulic Component Test Stand (HCTS) for use at all land based Fleet Readiness Centers (FRC), "L" Class, CVN ships and at the Marine Mobile Maintenance Facilities (MMF) based Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Departments (AIMDs). The HCTS provides hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic power, instrumentation and controls necessary for diagnostic testing and functional acceptance testing of repaired aircraft hydraulic and pneumatic components. The legacy HCTS is nearing the end of its useful service life and the following describes the requirements for a replacement.
<p>The replacement HCTS shall be a manually operated test stand (e.g. hand turned valves for pressure &amp; flow, numerical push buttons for temperature) with general programmable automated cyclic setting features. However, it is not the intention of the Navy for the HCTS to have pre-programmed Unit Under Test (UUT) automatic test programs to test and evaluate specific aircraft components. If any setting is automatically set the HCTS will have a manually operated redundant control.</p>
<p>The requirements of the Navy shall be met by a modular design that allows configuration of the HCTS to change by the adding of a separate console or system in order to meet the testing or operational requirements of the activity. The HCTS shall comprise of the following modules: Main Hydraulic Console (MHC) (all activities), Pump and Motor Test Console (P&amp;MTC) (selected land based activities) and Hydraulic Fluid Cooling System (HFCS) (USMC Maintenance facilities).</p>

<p>Two independent Dynamic Test Circuits capability: 30 gpm at 6,000 psig, 40 gpm at 5,000 psig, 60 gpm at 3,000 psig (all max) with full back pressure control; Low Pressure Test Circuit: 0-250 psi; Hydraulic Static Pressure Circuit: Maximum hydrostatic pressure of 10,000 psig; Pneumatic Static Pressure Circuit: Max pneumatic static pressure of 6,000 psig; Pump and Motor Capability (separate module): Able to interface/run a pump and/or motor in an additional chamber driving hydraulic pumps from 0 to 10,000 RPM, 300 horsepower, measure and display output torque of hydraulic motors in the range of 0 to 2500 in-lbs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Common Support Equipment (CSE) program is to satisfy this operational need by procuring a commercially built component test stand, which may require modifications to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contract will be a fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a minimum quantity of three (3) each Main Hydraulic Console (MHC) pilot production units (PPU), one (1) each Pump and Motor Test Console (PMTC) PPU, and one (1) each Hydraulic Fluid Cooling System (HFCS) PPU to be purchased with the first Delivery Order, along with associated technical and logistics data and training. After successful completion of contractor pilot production testing and government suitability and supportability evaluation, the government&nbsp;intends to issue delivery orders over four (4) production years for up to (80) Main Hydraulic Console production units, up to(16) Pump and Motor Test Console production units, and up to (22) Hydraulic Fluid Cooling System production units, as well as additional logistics and technical support elements.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage at http://www.navair.navy.mil on or about the week of October 24, 2011. Select "Opportunities" and "Open Solicitations".

<DESC><p><strong>UPDATE - An extension to the deadline for submital of qualifications has been issued.&nbsp; The new deadline is July 11, 2011, at 3:30 p.m. (PDST).&nbsp; Please note that the RFQ packages were initially released on May 9, 2011, and that the Pre-RFQ meeting was held on May 21, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any firms still interested in receiving the RFQ should submit a letter of interest by FAX to FAX Number 415.522.3316, Attention: Colleen Butler, Contract Specialist, or by e-mail to colleen.butler@gsa.gov, or mail to: GSA, Design and Construction Division (9P2PCS), ATTN: Colleen Butler, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd Floor West, San Francisco, CA 94102.&nbsp; FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL COLLEEN BUTLER AT 415.522.3170.</strong><br /><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for qualified contractors with Design Build project delivery experience to provide site design and to construct new housing in Ajo, Arizona, for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as GSA's client. Ajo is approximately 135 miles west of Tucson, Arizona, 112 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona, and 38 miles north of Lukeville, Arizona, on the border with Mexico and adjacent to Sonoita, Mexico. The project is bounded on the west by Sahuaro Road, the north by Esperanza Avenue, and the south by an arroyo. Due to the small size of the town of Ajo, CBP needs to make housing available to their personnel in order to meet its mission at this location.</p>
<p>The project includes (but is not limited to) the design and construction of all grading, drainage, underground utilities (water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, gas (if required), electricity, telephone, CATV, internet), streets, and sidewalks street lighting for approximately 46 modular, or stick-built, housing units on 11.61 acres. In addition a Common Area consisting of a 600sf playground, and 6 picnic tables, each with a shade structure, picnic table and barbecue pit shall be included. Design Build Bridging Documents (DBBD) is in development and will be issued with the Request for Proposals (RFP) in Phase Two of this procurement.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the site design and construction for the project is projected to be around $5,000,000 to $10,000,000, with project award anticipated in August 2011.</p>
<p>GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price competitive acquisition using the best-value trade-off process. This Two-Stage procurement process for the Design-Build Contract will be based upon evaluation criteria developed pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, and FAR subpart 15.3, Source Selection Procedures.</p>
<p>Phase One - Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will identify those firms which are most highly qualified. A maximum of five (5) firms will be selected for consideration for Phase Two - Request for Proposal (RFP). The short list will be based on the firms' submittals in response to the Phase One - RFQ. The Phase Two - RFP submission is the basis of making the final selection. Those firms included in Phase Two will be required to prepare fully developed technical and price proposals. The Government will not allow any stipend for preparation of proposals. Offerors can be a partnership, corporation, association, and/or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility for the project. A proposed joint venture must provide profiles for all firms in the joint venture.</p>
<p>This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs<br />Although not mandatory, firms are encouraged to affix their names to the Interested Vendors Listing for this requirement and register to receive notifications.</p>
<p>Firms interested in receiving the RFQ should submit a letter of interest by FAX to FAX Number 415.522.3316, Attention: Colleen Butler, Contract Specialist, or by e-mail to colleen.butler@gsa.gov, or mail to: GSA, Design and Construction Division (9P2PCS), ATTN: Colleen Butler, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd Floor West, San Francisco, CA 94102. The RFQ will be issued on May 9, 2011. Closing date and time for submittal of qualifications is June 8, 2011, at 3:30 p.m. (PDST). A Pre-RFQ Meeting will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday, May 17, 2011, in Ajo, Arizona. Questions regarding the RFQ shall be received until May 25, 2011. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<DESC>On September 30, 2011, in a competive acquisition under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 USC 637 (a), USCIS awarded ECU Communications of Gainesville, Virginia a contract for professional services in support of E-Verify and SAVE.&nbsp; The contract has a one year base period and two, one year option periods.&nbsp; The value of the contract if both option periods are exercised is $10,038,912.33.&nbsp;&nbsp;ECU Communications will provide support to USCIS to develop and implement a public education and outreach plan designed to: <br />&bull; Increase the number employers enrolled in E-Verify<br />&bull; Educate employees and stakeholders about their rights and responsibilities under the E-Verify program<br />&bull; Increase employers' understanding of the E-Verify program and increase user compliance<br />&bull; Educate SAVE agencies' understanding of the program and increase user compliance<br />&bull; Educate non-citizen benefit applicants about SAVE processes
<p>E-Verify is a free, Web-based system, operated in partnership by USCIS and the Social Security Administration (SSA), that allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of their employees. E-Verify was created in response to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208). Its goals of expanding employer participation and increasing employers' and employees' knowledge of their rights inherent in the E-Verify program support the government's overarching goals of reducing both unauthorized employment and hiring discrimination.</p>
<p>The SAVE program provides automated status verification information to Federal, State, and local benefit-granting agencies. These agencies use SAVE to be sure applicants are entitled to their benefits.</p>

<AWARDEE>International Business Machines Corporation, 6710 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817-1827 US
<DESC><p>As part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has operated the Flood Map Modernization (Map Mod) program since 2004. Funding for Map Mod program ended in fiscal year 2008; however, work continues on the projects that were funded during the Map Mod program. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Map Mod began the work of conducting a large-scale overhaul of the nation's flood hazard maps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Work accomplished under Map Mod has included data collection and analysis, map production, product delivery, and effective program management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This initiative produced digital flood hazard data, provided access to flood hazard data and maps via the Internet, and implemented a nationwide state-of-the-art infrastructure that enables all-hazard mapping.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2009, FEMA began the Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The vision for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that increases public awareness and leads to action that reduces risk to life and property. Risk MAP builds on flood hazard data and maps produced during the Map Mod program. Since the political and technological environments are continuing to evolve, this initiative will require the continuous review of existing systems and potential development of new standards or approaches in meeting the objectives outlined below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FEMA acknowledges that its current systems do not maximize technology, innovation and performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FEMA's goal with this award is to receive solutions that are innovative, proven, easy to implement, and effective, but not programmatically disruptive. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In light of constant funding constraints, solutions should be phased or have standalone components which can be implemented without the realization of the entire broad solution.</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to obtain contracted support which will replace the expiring Customer and Data Services (CDS) contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CDS provider will support the completion of Map Mod projects as well as support Risk MAP operations and the changes necessary to fully enable the Risk MAP vision.</p>
<p>This award will address only the Customer and Data Services acquisition.&nbsp; Other aspects of the Risk Map program are addressed under other contracts or agreements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>FEMA's flood maps are one of the essential tools for flood hazard mitigation in the United States. These maps are used an estimated 20 million times annually in the private and public sectors in the following ways:</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Lending institutions and insurance companies use them to determine who needs flood insurance and to determine flood insurance rates.<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Community planning officials, land developers, and engineers use them for designing and sitting new buildings and infrastructure to be safe from flooding.<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>States and communities use them for hazard mitigation planning and emergency management.<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Federal agencies use them when implementing Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">FEMA's Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) is shifting how it delivers information necessary for flood hazard reduction. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>FIMA's Risk Analysis Division (RAD) is in the early years of implementing the Risk MAP Program.<br /><br />In 2008, FEMA crafted an acquisition strategy to optimize stakeholder acceptance; deliver results using an enabling vision; ensure needed flexibility and adaptability exists; facilitate smooth and seamless transition; and provide innovation with problem solving capabilities to meet the challenges facing the Risk MAP program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This strategy involved a restructuring of the business model where a National Service Provider provided program management, customer service and many other services required to run the overall effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The approach includes establishing separate contracts to provide three groupings of services:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Program Management (PM)<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Customer and Data Services (CDS)<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Production and Technical Services (PTS)</p>

<DESC><p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) PART 8<br />LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION<br />DFISS III Task Order for TSO-IN</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE REQUIRING AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>a. Requesting Activity:</p>
<p>Technology Services Organization - Indianapolis (TSO-IN)<br />ATTN: DFAS-HTTACB/IN<br />8899 East 56th Street<br />Indianapolis, IN 46249-4300<br />(317) 212-3578</p>
<p>b. Contracting Activity</p>
<p>DFAS Indianapolis<br />Contract Services Directorate<br />8899 East 56th Street<br />Indianapolis, IN 46249</p>
<p><br />2. NATURE OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to obtain the necessary approvals for a limited source acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6. "Limited source" in this case pertains to the award of a logical follow-on task order for the continuation of DFISS III systems support in TSO-IN. The provision for a logical follow-on can be found at FAR 8.405-6(a) (1) (i) (C) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i) (C). This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property Administration Act of 1949. This exception has been used four (4) times.</p>
<p><br />3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICE:</p>
<p>The DFISS III Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) were awarded in April 2007 to fulfill a continuing need for DFAS system support. TSO-IN provides DFAS with software and technology support. TSO-IN supports the DFAS mission and other selected outside customers. The implementation of DFAS standard systems requires project and program management support, analytical, technical, and programming support as well as the writing of programs to support database administration. Due to varying systems at each site, several types of abilities are required for the required tasks. Systems analysis skills are required for a variety of languages and processes. Technical analysis of hardware platforms including mainframe, mid-tier, as well as personal computers, is also needed. This Task Order will provide TSO-IN with contractor support for the following systems: Automated Time Attendance and Production System (ATAAPS), Computerized Accounts Payable System (CAPS), Case Management System (CMS), Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) Operations Support, Defense Debt Management System (DDMS), Deployable Disbursing System (DDS), Enterprise Testing Support, Elimination of Unmatched Disbursements (EUD) System, the Headquarters Accounting Reporting System (HQARS), the Operational Data Store (ODS) system in support of the WebCas Module and Funds Control Module, Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS), the Rewards and Recognition System (R&amp;R), the SMARTDOCS system. If necessary, support may also be required for the Defense Integrated Financial System (DIFS). Software Process Improvement support is required for Task 6, Software Process Management. In addition, there may be support required for other TSO-IN systems, but this option under the Task Order will only be used if required by the government.</p>
<p>DFAS/TSO-IN requires contractor support for the DFISS III TSO-IN services for the period of October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012 at TSO-IN, Indianapolis. TSO-IN is requesting the issuance of a logical follow-on Task Order HQ0425-07-A-0003-0019 to continue providing a contractor staff that can respond quickly to changing environments in support of those systems/projects assigned to TSO-IN. Contractor support is required to assist TSO-IN in implementing software related System Change Requests (SCRs), customer support, process improvement and installation support. The services to be acquired fall within the general areas of software design and analysis, software development, programming, debugging, software testing, software maintenance, software installation, document conversion, risk management, software process improvement (SPI), quality assurance, project management, prototyping, development of system documentation and training. The contractor shall provide design, development, modification, conversion, technology infusion, technical support and guidance as required, and maintenance of the system and its subsystems supported by TSO-IN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance is from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012.</p>
<p>5. ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE</p>
<p>The Total Estimated Value is $10,865,289.10.</p>
<p><br />6. PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The DFISS III BPAs were awarded so that the activities requiring these services could depend on the consistency of one company for a period of five years. The BPAs were competed and awards were based on best value factors including technical experience, past performance, management, staffing, and cost/price. Per FAR 8.405-3(a)(3), all new requirements were initially competed between the four BPA holders. The BPA terms specified that subsequent awards for the same services will not be recompeted, but logical follow-on orders will be awarded after a determination of satisfactory performance has been made.</p>
<p>In this case, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services (HP) is the incumbent. HP currently has a staff of 71 people. This staff supports numerous systems for TSO-IN and DFAS. TSO-IN relies on the staff for their technical qualifications and system knowledge and cannot risk the personnel disruption of a recompetition every year. The primary reason for establishing a five-year BPA with the understanding that follow-on orders would be awarded was to avoid the risk of the learning curve, as well as improving staff retention. One of the subfactors in the BPA evaluation was staff retention.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE</p>
<p>The award of this task order is considered a best value award as it is a logical follow-on to a best value competed award. The competition was between GSA Schedule holders. Five proposals were received. Evaluations for the competed award considered the following evaluation factors: 1) Past Performance; 2) Technical; 3) Management Plan; 4) Personnel Expertise and 5) Price. Of these, price was not the most important. HPES won the initial competition because their proposal received an overall rating of Outstanding. Pricing proposed for the BPA was based on GSA Schedule pricing and then discounted for the DFAS award. Pricing was provided for five years and the best evaluation considered the total of five (5) years. HPES's BPA pricing is considered fair and reasonable based on comparison with Schedule pricing, historical and DFISS II pricing and the competitive environment of the BPA award.</p>
<p>While four years have passed since the initial competition, the circumstances and type of work being accomplished have not changed. Additionally, the experience that HPES has gained in this particular effort has increased over the last three years. To bring on a new contractor at this point would again not override the technical expertise and value and thus it is doubtful that a new awardee would win in a best value competition under the purview of the DFISS III BPAs.</p>
<p><br />8. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY</p>
<p>The market survey for the BPA competition revealed numerous companies with potential capability for these services. The BPA RFQ was posted on GSA e-Buy for all qualified companies to consider. Five quotes were received. Four BPAs were awarded. The BPA holders have included numerous small and small disadvantaged businesses in their portfolios to use in conjunction with their own capabilities.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS</p>
<p>This order must be issued on a limited-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the BPA. Initially all FSS 70 schedule holders were provided fair opportunity to establish a BPA. In turn, all BPA awardees were then given a fair opportunity to be considered for the initial task order. The use of a logical follow-on is justified because the same work is continuing and there is a continuing need for contractor support. The inclusion of priced options was not considered viable since the Statement of Work is updated from year to year which results in different numbers of hours per labor category. The SOW changes from year to year are within scope of the base year, in that as some system work is minimized, other systems may be bolstered.</p>
<p>10. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION (Efforts to obtain competition)</p>
<p>See Paragraph 6 above. The BPA awards were competed and resulted in pricing below the GSA schedule; then, the initial task order awards were competed between the BPA holders resulting in further reduction in rates. The BPA instructions notified the holders that subsequent task orders for the same services would not be recompeted, but that logical follow-ons would be awarded.</p>

<p>The DFISS III Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) were awarded in April 2007 to fulfill a continuing need for DFAS system support. DFAS-TSO-IN and DFAS-TSO-CL provides DFAS with software and technology support. DFAS-TSO-IN and DFAS-TSO-CL supports the DFAS mission and other selected outside customers.

BRAC Program Management Support is also required for the administrative duties of transitioning systems from TSO-Pensacola to other enduring DFAS sites.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this effort is October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012. The government estimate is $10,569,515.63.<br /><br />4. PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>

<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE</p>
<p>The award of the initial task order for TSO-IN and TSO-CL was competed between the four BPA holders on a best value basis. HP was awarded that order. Per the terms of the BPA, a logical follow-on was anticipated.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The services to be received under this action include support of USCYBERCOM Operations Directorate (J3) three mission critical lines of operation: 1) Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Operations (DGO); 2) Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO); and 3) Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The objectives within each of the three mission lines of operation are currently supported through the various tasks delineated on ENCORE II Task Order HC1028-08-D-2023-VC04.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The VC04 Task Order provides information security expertise in support of protection of the GIG.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This includes Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Perimeter Defense; Malicious Code Analysis; CND Incident Handling; Vulnerability Management/Reporting; Risk Analysis and Readiness; and Strategic Analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This entails 24x7x365 manning, which is currently being supported by the contractor workforce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The nature of cyber operations, defense and offense is unquantifiable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DOD will never be able to measure exactly how much support is required to adequately defend deliberate hackers and malcontents from exploiting networks and introducing malware that does significant damage to DOD and public infrastructures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, putting an effective contract vehicle in place that enables flexibility and lower costs is possible and desirable. The Secretary of Defense directed the establishment of the sub-unified Combatant Command (COCOM), USCYBERCOM in June 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The command was activated in May 2010 when its Commander was confirmed by Congress. However there is still much work to be done with defining the commands mission and authority as well as understanding/refining relationships with COCOMs, Services, Other Government Agencies, Industry, and our Foreign Partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With an evolving mission, unrefined authorities within the Federal Government, limited access to government workers with highly technical skills, Government Service pay limitations, (same issue applies to military personnel), and inability to determine the scope of support necessary, the use of a Firm Fixed Price contract is not feasible. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The proposed contractual action is pursuant to the authority of the 10 U.S.C. 2304c(b)(3). In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C) - The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">USCYBERCOM is a sub-unified combatant command under the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USSTRATCOM is in the process of obtaining government civilian billets to perform the majority of functions currently provided by NGIS, the incumbent contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is impossible to predict which critically manned positions USSTRATCOM will identify as Government civilians or at what grade/level or even when these billets will become available to USCYBERCOM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Until the conversions are made, it is more economical and efficient to maintain the current contractor workforce to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>meet current mission critical requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this action is to provide uninterrupted mission critical contractor support to USCYBERCOM while the positions currently manned by contractor personnel are in-sourced to Government personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A sole source task order was awarded to NGIS under contract number HC1028-08-D-2023 VC23 on 15 Jul 2011. This order consisted of a 6 month base period and a 6 month option. This order is being converted to a twelve (12) month period of performance. This will allow for continuity of service and avoid any risk to performance in the event funds are not available in FY12.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NGIS<span style="COLOR: black"> will provide mission integrity for critically staffed positions supporting the DOD Cyber Operations and Defense mission. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>USCYBERCOM is extremely limited by the security requirements; personnel must have and maintain a Top Secret/Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) with polygraph for access to government facilities supporting the mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The clearance process is very time-consuming and can be as long as nine (9) months to clear an individual, which makes a full fair opportunity competition utterly impracticable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Without a TS/SCI clearance, personnel cannot gain access to facilities or network resources leaving them idle for months at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the context of this short logical follow-on task order, the economic waste and inefficiency is obvious. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black">Awarding this effort to another vendor would introduce significant risk to the overall mission as a result of the long lead times for obtaining TS/SCI security clearances and facility accesses in order to perform the effort detailed in the performance work statement (PWS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Significant risk is also involved in the training/situational awareness time necessary to ensure a new contractor is prepared to assume the mission critical functions identified in the PWS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USCYBERCOM and DOD cannot afford the loss of this support for even one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NGIS, as the incumbent, can maintain mission integrity and provide continuity; no other vendor can provide the same level of support at this time, which is critical in light of the fact that </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">USCYBERCOM does not have full staffing of its authorized military or civilian billets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: red">The existing task order will expire on 15 Jul 2011</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">. Current tasks require personnel trained in highly technical fields, DOD specific Command and Control applications, and TS/SCI clearances with polygraphs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NGIS has been providing the support for the last three (3) years and thus has the knowledge, situational awareness, and hands-on experience for the critical mission requirements of USCYBERCOM J3 operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NGIS is uniquely qualified to provide the support necessary without disruption until such time that government employees are on-boarded to replace the contractor full-time employees (FTEs).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances it was determined that NGIS is the only responsible source that can meet the USCYBERCOM's short term mission critical requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>BEST VALUE DETERMINATION</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">((FAR 8.405-2(d) &amp; 8.405-6(g)(2)(v))</em> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">This is a short-term, sole-source logical follow-on to the current task order being performed by NGIS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The anticipated contract type is T&amp;M, which is justified by the volatile changes in task order requirements that will be expected as USCYBERCOM progresses toward its goal of obtaining government civilian billets and reducing its reliance on contractor support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="COLOR: black">The Contracting Officer will perform a price analysis to ensure the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This information will be ascertained by review of the proposed prices to NGIS' established ENCORE II labor rates and categories as well as comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government shall also closely tailor specific requirements to ensure that only the necessary number and proper category of labor categories will be ordered as requirements arise under the T&amp;M structure of the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The price risk of a sole-source acquisition is mitigated by the economy and efficiency of a logical follow-on task order of short duration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The additional cost of a full fair opportunity competition among all ENCORE II contract holders, plus the inefficiency of transitioning to another contractor for a short period, cannot be justified in this context.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government has a multi-year relationship with the incumbent in the context of this requirement that will help ensure the Government gets the best value.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">This acquisition represents the best value to the government. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">7. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>MARKET RESEARCH</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">((FAR 10.002) &amp; (FAR 8.405-6(g)(2)(vi))</em> The market research revealed that NGIS was the only vendor that could satisfy the Government's minimum essential requirements under the unique circumstances of this logical follow-on task order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These essential requirements include expertise in the three (3) mission lines of operations and the ability for all contractor staff to obtain and retain appropriate clearance levels/polygraphs to enable immediate access to government facilities at National Security Agency (NSA) Ft. George G. Meade, MD. Only those ENCORE II ID/IQ contract holders currently providing support in NSA facilities were consulted on their ability to meet this requirement due to the timeline associated with obtaining clearances and personnel access to facilities and networks and NSA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was determined that while initial responses were always affirmative, further discussion revealed the likelihood of contractors substituting resources from other contract vehicles supporting USCYBERCOM in NSA spaces, which would only increase the extra cost and inefficiency of a full fair opportunity competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, other areas within USCYBERCOM would have been impacted by drawing resources away to support this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this time NGIS is the only known vendor capable of providing uninterrupted/critical support to the USCYBERCOM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Awarding this contract action to NGIS will maintain mission integrity for critically manned positions. Bringing in another vendor at this time would require extensive ramp-up time for clearances, polygraphs, facility access and mission familiarity introducing additional costs and time that USCYBERCOM cannot currently afford.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NGIS can maintain mission integrity and provide continuity and no other vendor can be found that can provide the same level of support, which is critical in light of the fact that the USCYBERCOM does not have full manning of its authorized military billets, or full manning of its authorized civilian billets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
