EMERGING MARKETS – WORLDWIDE 

The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East.

For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.

This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility of a small business.  NFEC Southwest intends to award more than two Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity small business contracts.  

Typical tasks that may be performed under the resulting contracts include environmental remedial design, remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.

It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California.  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business firm(s) whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be incorporated into the resulting contracts.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).

Factors 1, 2, and 3 are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 4 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Cucuk Suryo Suprojo, Director General of Air Communications, 5th Floor, Karsa Building, Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat No.8, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia, Phone:  (62-21) 350-5133, 350-5137, Fax: (62-21) 350-5139, E-mail:  cucuks@indo.net.id  
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop Technical Assistance for an air traffic control (ATC) project over the Natuna Islands.  

The Natuna Islands are located in the South China Sea, in the waters northeast of Singapore, and in between the Malaysian peninsula and east Malaysia on the island of Borneo.  In 1973, the authority for air navigation services over the Natuna Islands was delegated to Singapore and Malaysia in accordance with an agreement reached at the International Civil Aviation Organization's Regional Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Indonesia still holds full authority on the airspace over its territory, despite having contracted part of its airspace management to other sovereign entities.  Malaysia and Singapore charge fees for managing this portion of Indonesia's airspace, but all airspace and overflight charges are returned to Jakarta.  

Over time, the intention of the Government of Indonesia is to assume the rights and obligations associated with managing the airspace above the Natuna Islands.  The issue of transferring the airspace will eventually be resolved through discussions at the political levels between the governments of Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.  Regardless of the arrangements and agreements that are reached between these three governments, considerable investment will be required to put in place the ATC systems and equipment to achieve full airspace management capability.  In addition, technical assistance and training will be needed to enhance the technical and human resources capability of Indonesia's air traffic and airspace management personnel.  

The objective of the USTDA-funded technical assistance is to determine the training, technical and financial requirements of the project and recommend a program for its implementation.  This ATC activity would promote the modernization of Indonesia’s aviation and transportation infrastructure, which are critical to the commercial and economic development of the country.  The immediate impact of USTDA’s assistance would be Indonesia’s full management of its airspace and the improvement of local air traffic control capabilities.  Improved aviation safety would be both a short- and long-term product of any USTDA assistance.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $627,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 P.M., OCTOBER 22, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop Technical Assistance to identify and recommend regulations for airline industry use of Computer Reservation Systems (CRSs) in Indonesia.  

A CRS allows a subscriber, such as a travel agent, to find flight schedules, airfares, seat availability, and to order and issue tickets.  The system also serves air carriers by providing them with an efficient way of communicating this information to the subscribers of that CRS.  In the industry, different CRSs compete to provide the best services and most complete information to their fee-based users.

Until just a few years ago, there were only two air carriers operating in Indonesia, Garuda and Merpati (both state-owned).  The passage of the "Autonomy Law 22" in 1999 opened the market to the private sector, resulting in the registration of 19 new airlines.  Although the airline industry is growing rapidly, some regulation will be needed to create a fair market environment until the industry matures.

This USTDA-funded activity will assist the Grantee to implement market-oriented reforms to minimize anticompetitive practices.  The establishment of appropriate regulations will help promote competition in Indonesia's airline industry, which first allowed private sector participation in 1999.  In the short term, this project is expected to help generate exports of CRS services, computer software and hardware.  This project will also contribute to the expansion of Indonesia's airline industry.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $117,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop Technical Assistance to assess the current safety and security procedures at Indonesia’s airports and to provide recommendations for improvement.  

Indonesia has approximately 163 airports (including dirt air strips, general aviation, and heliports) of which 23 are international airports.  The vast majority of these airports are managed by the Directorate General of Air Communications (DGAC), Indonesia’s top authority for all civil aviation matters.  During the last five years the Government has implemented a liberal airline licensing policy, which has resulted in the growth of the airline market from 2 to 21 licensed carriers.  Competition amongst airlines has caused fares to decrease and air travel to increase.  This drastic rise in business has resulted in a major strain on the airports’ ability to provide adequate safety and security provisions for passengers.  

In 2000, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) conducted an audit of Indonesia’s airport safety and security procedures and systems.  The objective of this audit was to conduct an assessment of the safety oversight capability of the DGAC and to ensure that it conforms to the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices.  The Interim Audit Report prepared by ICAO specified precise areas where Indonesia needed to make improvements, and in response, Indonesia submitted an action plan addressing all the findings and recommendations contained in the Interim Audit Report.  Although Indonesia’s action plan addressed all the issues raised in the ICAO Audit Report, safety and security continue to be important concerns at all of Indonesia’s airports.  For example, the probability that an aviation-related security incident will occur in Indonesia is 1 in 10,000, whereas in Singapore the probability is 1 in 100,000.  In light of this, the Government of Indonesia has made a commitment to upgrading the safety and security procedures at all of its airports. 

The USTDA-funded technical assistance will help to identify and remedy the security and safety weaknesses in Indonesia’s airports.  The Contractor will prepare a detailed action plan including specific training requirements for upgrading safety and security, cost estimates, an investment plan, and an implementation schedule for the safety and security measures that will enable Indonesian airports to operate close to or at par with international standards.  The project will help Indonesian airports maintain a safe environment for commercial activity, tourism, regional economic integration and foreign investment.  These factors are critical to the country’s sustained growth and development.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $443,500 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 Oct 04; FY 06 by 1 Oct 05; FY 07 by 1 Oct 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07; and, FY 09 by 1 Oct 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sept 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas:  1) High Speed Text Survey and Selection Capabilities; and 2) Revolutionary Techniques for Large-scale Database Processing

1)  High Speed Text Survey and Selection Capabilities.  

The focus will be on processing textual information over multiple channels at high speeds (10 Gbit/s and up). There would be roughly four modes of operation: survey, selection, temporal, correlation.

a. The Survey mode should be able to:
-  Identify prevalent languages on each tributary (STM-4 to E1) 
-  Identify prevalent domains (STM-4 to E1) 
-  Identify significant changes to tributaries such as loading, times of peak traffic, language distribution, etc.

b. The Selection mode should be able to:
-  Select messages (or random samples) in specified languages 
-  Select messages (or random samples) containing specified character strings 
-  Select messages on specified topics 
-  Cluster messages by similarity (without training) and select messages belonging to user selected clusters 
-  Cluster messages according to geographic information (either according to content within the message, or to sending or receiving metadata)

-  Identify messages on previously unseen topics (birth of new topics) (novel and new)
-  Identify messages on vanished topics (death of old topics) (how do you know when the old topic is dead, by time decay, etc)

c. The Temporal mode should be able to:
-  Select messages on specified topics with automatic adaptation to changes within the topic 
-  Given automatic adaptation to changes in topics, identify prior messages (from stored metadata such as scores) that were previously unselected due to insufficiently rapid adaptation 
-Given a set of messages on a given topic, identify previous messages on the same topic (from stored metadata such as scores)

d.  The Correlation mode should be able to:
-Compare a high-speed link with a news feed (e.g. Reuters) and identify / correlate topics of interest 
-Compare the text on one high-speed link with another and identify correlations where the two links are co-located and connected by a high-speed network and where they are connected by a low speed dial-up network.

2)  Revolutionary Techniques for Large-scale Database Processing.

In the context of this BAA, the term "database" is intended to convey a new kind of extremely large, omni-media, virtually-centralized, and semantically-rich information repository that is not constrained by today’s limited commercial database. This BAA seeks innovative technologies needed to architect, populate, and exploit such a data environment. Key metrics include the amount of total information that is potentially covered, the utility of its data structures for data entry and use by humans and machines in searching and browsing, data integration, and capability to automatically populate, and the completeness, correctness, and timeliness of the information when used for predictive analysis and modeling in exploiting the information in these repositories.  It is anticipated this will require revolutionary new technology.

The data environment envisioned is of an unprecedented scale, will most likely be heterogeneous and distributed, must be capable of being continuously updated, and must support both autonomous and semi-automated analysis. The latter requirement implies that the representation used must, to the greatest extent possible, be interpretable by both algorithms and human analysts. The data environment must support change detection and be able to execute automated procedures implied by new information. Because of expected growth and adaptation needs, the effective schema must be adaptable by the user so that as new sources of information, analytical methods, or representations arise, the representation of data may be re-structured without great cost. If distributed, the database may require new search methods to answer complex, less than specific queries across physical implementations and new automated methods for maintaining consistency. 

The potential sources of information will include extensive existing databases.  Innovative technologies are sought for treating these databases as a virtual, centralized, grand database.  This will require technologies for automatically determining schemas, access methods and controls, and translation of complex English language queries into the appropriate language for the relevant databases.

A successful effort would require the offeror to:

a. Develop the capability to rapidly populate databases with information from incompatible databases, semi-structured and structured data formats, geospatial databases, and natural language text. 

b. Develop domain ontologies, web-wrappers/scrappers, and data extractors, to facilitate automatic interpretation of data without a priori knowledge of database schemas.


II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $36M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $9M; FY 06 - $9M; FY 07 - $9M; and FY 08 - $9M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $150K to $2M per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. The Government anticipates multiple awards in each of  technical areas. A multi-phase approach will be needed to achieve program goals. Proposers should note that approaches with eclectic ideas from multiple technical specialties or communities are actively sought. The degree of advances will vary among the technical areas of interest, but the goal is to create a series of prototype systems that add value quickly and improves rapidly over the program schedule -- the primary goal is a series of leave-behind prototypes with limited set of proof-of-concept demonstrations in very high risk areas.  

The anticipated start date for the FY 05 efforts under the solicitation is February 2005.

III.  EXPECTED TECHNICAL DELIVERABLES  

1) Regular Software Releases.  Software releases will be packaged with detailed technical documentation; user documentation, libraries, sources and executable code, and delivered as self-extracting installation executables for the expected computing environment of our customers.

2) Technical Briefings and Reports.  Briefings and reports will be developed as a product of individual effort, a tiger team, or as part of a larger working group.  Quarterly Status Reports and Annual Project Summary Reports must be submitted as a minimum.

3) Internet Products.  Software products that integrate (1) and (2), will be directly uploaded/posted to Web pages specified by AFRL Program Managers.  Proposers are encouraged to identify data and software components (including source code) they would be willing to make available to others to help achieve the overall objectives of this BAA.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   


VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following area:  Collaboration and Services. 

Collaboration and Services:

Collaboration's focus is on developing information technology needed by teams of analysts and operations and policy personnel to anticipate and preempt threats to U.S. interests.  The goal is to make such teams faster, smarter, and more joint in their day-to-day operations. It will apply automation to team processes so that more information can be exploited, more hypotheses created and examined, more models built and populated with evidence, and overall, more crises dealt with simultaneously. Specific areas include: 

a.  Cognitive aids that allow humans and machines to think together in real-time about complicated problems, including improved tools and architectures which would focus relevant mission data context to analysts (and/or analyst teams).

b.  The means to overcome the biases and limitations of the human cognitive system.

c.  Cognitive amplifiers that help teams of people rapidly and fully comprehend complicated and uncertain situations.

d.  The means to rapidly and seamlessly cut across and complement existing stove-piped hierarchical organizational structures by creating dynamic, adaptable, peer-to-peer collaborative networks. 
 
Services' focus is on developing information technology needed by senior analysts and policy and decision makers to anticipate and preempt threats against the U.S., its persons and interests. The goal is to increase the speed and decisiveness of analyses, to decrease time to decision and dissemination and foster a truly joint collaborative analysis environment among all IC (Intelligence Communities) and DOD (Department of Defense) entities. It will apply background-running, service-automated environments to gather vast amounts of joint information and data, rapidly draw down to viable intelligence, and allow analysts and decision makers to decisively deal with more crises in shorter amounts of time. It will create knowledge bases to assist in collaboration and decision-making. Specific areas will include: 

a.   Intelligent software agents designed to gather, process, exploit and disseminate information to the appropriate analysts and policy and decision makers 

b.  Software agents designed to help gather and accumulate an analysts' knowledge base and to assist in gathering like information. Collaborative software agents designed to gather together related ideas, information, and personnel for the purpose of speeding comprehensive analysis and decision-making.  

c.  Software agents designed to accommodate the mission context, the user cognitive role and cognitive readiness and the situational relevant topic areas to focus relevant and new information to the user analyst or analyst team within the analyst context focus areas of interest.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration requires contractor provided auditing services for the review of selected representative payees located in various locations throughout the state of Florida..     The Social Security and SSI disability rolls include beneficiaries with special needs.     When these beneficiaries need help in the management of their Social Security benefits, the law permits the SSA to appoint an individual or organization to help the beneficiaries manage their monthly payments.     These individuals or organizations are referred to as representative payees.     SSA is mandated by law and regulations to obtain annual written reports from all representative payees to ensure that beneficiaries' funds are properly administered.     Programmatic site reviews of selected representative payees are performed by SSA field office personnel.     This solicitation seeks contractor services to provide audits of the representative payees accounting practices as supplements to the programmatic site reviews.     Travel with overnight stays is required.     This requirement is a total small business set-aside.     Offers submitted by concerns that are not small businesses will not be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

During operation this container is expanded for the preparation and serving of meals. The CK has a flexible design allowing for operation on and off the trailer and operation with the integral 10 KW tactical quiet generator or external power sources.  The CK requires the integration of environmental controls (heating and A./C) and ventilati on systems to support cooks in the ambient working environments of -25 degrees F to 120 degrees F.

CLIN 0001 - Truck Mounted Flash-Butt Welders; QTY:  3 EA.; Unit Price: $____________; Extended Price: $__________________.  
CLIN 0002 – 160-Ton Rail Puller; QTY: 2 EA.; Unit Price: $_____________; Extended Price: $__________________.  TOTAL ALL CLINs: $____________________.  

Statement of Work (SOW):  See Attachment 1.

Past Performance:  

Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).  

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001, Quantity 3 Each & CLIN 0002; Quantity: 2 Each; 120 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  CLIN 0001; Quantity:  3 Each; CLIN 0002; Quantity: 2 Each; 180 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: __________; Quantity: _______; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW), past performance, and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are of equal importance.  The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness.  

It is the Government’s intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.
 
Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract.  Acceptance will be by representatives of the Iraqi Republic Railway, Iraq (grid zone coordinates: MB 42252 87280) within 30 days of product delivery.  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items, offerors should submit with their quotation:  (1) a price proposal which shows the proposed unit price for each line item, the extended total price for each line item, and the total overall price for all contract line items; (2) supporting information or product literature/specifications for the proposed items that demonstrates a clear understanding of the specifications stated in the SOW but not exceeding the clause at 52.212-1; (3) a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (MAY 2002), and Alternate I (APR 2002); (4) Contractor’s Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number; (5) Contractor’s Cage Code; and (6) an affirmation that it has an active registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is at the website www.ccr.gov.  Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor’s Registration database in order to receive payment, should they receive a Government contract award!  

The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial, as well as the following instructions:  Offerors shall submit information on their past performance in like or similar acquisitions in the last three years.  The Offerors will provide no more than two pages of past performance information.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  Each instance of relevant past performance shall include the contract number and/or delivery order number, contract type, contract value, whether competitive or sole source, description of work, and customer point of contact including e-mail address and telephone number.  Offerors’ technical proposal (including delivery terms) shall be no longer than three pages; however, self-certification pages under 52.212-3 listed below do not count against the limit.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  Offerors’ pricing data shall be no longer than three pages.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  No attachments are allowed and only the front of a page shall be used.  A page that has material on back and front will count as two pages.  The contracting officer may determine proposals that deviate from these type-size and page limitations as non-responsive.  Offerors shall submit, in English, an original proposal and one copy.  The proposal shall be easily segregated between the technical quote, past performance, and contract line item (CLIN) price, which shall be quoted in US dollars.  Both the original and copy may be transmitted via e-mail.  The copy of the proposal submitted is for evaluation purposes and shall not bear any logos, trademarks, company names or points of contact information that would identify the Offeror.  Compressed or executable files are not permitted.  Offers based on Irrevocable Letters of Credit (ILC) will not be considered; these acquisitions are funded with U.S. appropriations which does not allow for ILCs!

<SUBJECT>70--DoD Purchase Card Program Data Mining Tool Acquisition
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ-05-R-CARD
<RESPDATE>101504
<ARCHDATE>12142004
<CONTACT>John Norway, 703 325-3332
<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback regarding the development of the acquisition strategy and request for proposal for the Data Mining Tool acquisition.  The purpose of the acquisition is to provide a tool that  identifies fraud and misuse of the Government purchase card, i.e., unauthorized transactions by authorized cardholders.  BACKGROUND:  The focus in the early years of the DoD program was to encourage the use of the card wherever practical so as to streamline the procurement of small purchases and pass the internal savings on to the war fighter.  The result was the issuance of  over 230,000 purchase cards and purchases of more than $10.6 billion in FY 2001.  However, the emphasis on the growth and business process re-engineered savings was somewhat at the expense of adequate operational controls.  The General Accounting Office ( GAO) and the DoD Inspector General (DoDIG) issued several audit reports in the FY 2001-2003 timeframe identifying a wide range of implementation and internal control problems in the DoD charge card program.  The lack of internal controls contributed to fra udulent and abusive spending, theft and misuse of Government property.  These types of fraud and misuse are different than traditional charge card fraud in that they represent unauthorized transactions by an authorized cardholder.  Since that time, DoD has  taken corrective actions to strengthen controls over the program and has reduced the number of cards to a manageable level.  In FY 2003, the Department of Defense (DoD) Purchase Card Program had reduced the number of cardholder accounts to approximately 1 20,000, however the card was used for over 10.7 million transactions totaling over $7 billion.  Although significant progress has been made to improve internal controls, fraud and misuse continue to be identified.  This has prompted the department to look for data mining capabilities. ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIAL:  More background information on the purchase card program may be obtained at the following website: Department of Defense Purchase Card Program Management Office at:  http://purchasecard.saalt.army.mil/ and at http://www.acq. osd.mil/dpap/pcard/pcardguidebook.pdf. ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:   SCOPE The Government has a requirement for a data-screening tool that, using a combination of a discreet DoD-tailored neural network model and Department of Defense (DoD)-specific business rules, will identify transactions at the most risk of being fraudul ent or abusive.  The Government seeks an offeror who will also provide an authorization/issuance tool that creates user accounts that capture the necessary user attributes needed to support data mining capabilities.  The Government seeks an offeror who wil l also provide a risk assessment tool that, on a monthly basis, provides a report card on the status of the internal controls of the purchase card program.  At the DoD Program Management Offices discretion, the tool will be piloted at a maximum number of 4 sites. ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:  The objective of this procurement is to obtain a solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically reduces the risk of fraudulent and/or misuse transactions on the Government purchase card.  As such, the primary objectives o f this acquisition are to: 1.	Provide a database of at-risk transactions identified during analysis, modeling and simulation.  The database shall include three separately identified universes of transactions:  (1) neural network results only, (2) DoD-specific business rules only, an d (3) results with a combination of both (1) and (2).   2.	Provide a data-mining tool that uses DoD data to develop a discreet neural network model combined with DoD-specific business rules to dynamically identify transactions at the greatest risk of being fraudulent or improper.   3.	Provide a database to capture and maintain daily tr ansactional and quarterly merchant profile data feeds from the designated DoD card-issuing contractors.  A subset of this database will be the responses to transactions selected for review.  The database will maintain a rolling 12 months of data for online  retrieval by designated program officials.  Another 24 months of data will be archived for retrieval within 2 days.   4.	Provide a vehicle for distributing selected transactions to the appropriate officials for review and resolution. 5.	Provide a tool for creating user accounts, routing those accounts for approval, and sending a transaction to the bank to authorize issuance of the card.  6.	Provide a risk based assessment tool that provides, on a monthly basis, a report card on the status of the internal controls of the purchase card program.   7.	Provide a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan that identifies specific methods for quality assurance surveillance and identification of specific actions to be taken by the contractor to control performance on the contract to ensure that it meets the req uirements of the Performance Work Statement. 8.	Provide a user satisfaction survey that will be designed to capture user satisfaction and suggested enhancements. ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT:  The successful offeror will play a significant role in creating the data mining and risk assessment tools. The Government will consider both new and existing system designs in both software and underlying hardware platforms to p rovide a high quality product.  As soon as possible after contract award, a successful vendor must be able to provide a database of at-risk transactions identified during analysis, modeling and simulation; a vehicle for distributing selected transactions t o the appropriate officials for review and resolution; and a database to capture and maintain daily transactional and quarterly merchant profile data feeds and the responses to transactions selected for review.    SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:  The successful offeror will have significant responsibility for the continued development and refinement of the data-mining tool. The Government seeks help in identifying user needs, back-end business application needs, and overall f unctional enhancements.  The Government also seeks the establishment of strong processes to formalize the development and facilitate the prioritization of improvements. PERFORMANCE-BASED:  Proposals will be solicited using performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Performance Work Statement approach for defining the requirements.   TERM:  The contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with option years to be determined in the final solicitation. QUESTIONS:  The Government is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the RFP. 1.	Is a managed service approach feasible or should the government provide all the hardware/software to maintain the data-mining tool and repository? 2.	What specific detail or additional information is needed in order to propose on this requirement? 3.	How would you recommend handling software-licensing issues?  4.	What contractual incentives or disincentives would motivate outstanding performance?  In what areas can performance most effectively be incentivized? 5.	We are planning a two phases approach:  (1) development and (2) deployment, maintenance and technological enhancements.  What type of contract would be most beneficial to both the government and the contractor for development?  For deployment, maintenan ce and technological maintenance? 6.	What portions of work are suitable for small business participation on an effort of this size? 7.	How do you propose ensuring the interoperability of the proposed solution with card issuing banks applications/processes? 8.	For those charge card companies already providing charge card services to the government, how  would you insulate your commercial charge card product lines from this product? 9.	What additional data do you require to design and develop a workflow tool to facilitate an authorization/issuance capability? 10.	What is a reasonable timeline for development?  For deployment?  What additional information is needed to plan for deployment?  11.	What are your proposed strategies for minimizing the need for classroom training? 12.	What data and level of support are needed from the DoD card issuing banks to support/enable the process?   How do you propose to comply with data security and privacy requirements? 13.	What do you propose as meaningful performance metrics for the success of the project? 14.	For internal fraud and/or misuse detection, how will your product ensure a high probability of detection of high-risk transactions while minimizing the amount of false positives? 15.	For internal fraud and/or misuse detection, how will your product prioritize the highest risk transactions to enable us to optimize our resources for transaction review? 16.	How do you propose making use of existing DoD infrastructure to minimize program costs? 17.	How far into the future are you willing to commit your company to support this requirement?  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed ten (10) pages, with an optional Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed ten (10) slides.  Submit responses, via e-mail, to John Norw ay at John.Norway@itec4.army.mil not later than October 15, 2004.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NFEC), Southwest Division, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Environmental Remediation Services at various locations in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  Resulting Contract’s will be fixed price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Environment Multiple Award Contract’s (EMAC).

This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business (See Note 1).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility of a small business.  NFEC Southwest intends to award more than two Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity small business contracts.  

Typical tasks that may be performed under the resulting contracts include environmental remedial design, remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Additional work includes: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants may include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California.  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business firm(s) whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be incorporated into the resulting contracts.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).

Factors 1, 2, and 3 are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 4 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with Sections L, and M of the solicitation.

When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with Sections L, and M of the solicitation.

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments.  The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys.  Upgrades to existing ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed.  Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar.  These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions.  Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas.  Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense.  Additional technology areas include the measurement, test, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of advanced radar systems. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising technologies for both monostatic and multistatic radar sensors in the areas of Space Time Adaptive Processing, both Adaptive and Knowledge Based (KB), Multi-Channel Signal Processing Techniques, Innovative and Wideband Processing Techniques, Multi-Dimensional Processing Techniques, Improved radar system performance developments in spread doppler clutter environment for a theater application and, in general, technologies that may significantly improve the performance of advanced radar systems.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information.  Contact the technical POC.  The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).

All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Elaine C. Kordyban, Rome Research Site/SNRD, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 and reference BAA-03-05-IFKA. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. 

This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 06. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award. White papers for FY03 should be submitted by 15 Apr 03. White papers for the out years should be submitted as follows:  FY 04 – 15 Apr; FY 05 – 15 Apr 05; and, FY 06 – 15 Apr 06. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.

Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience -- The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution -- The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value --Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. 

Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered.

Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. 
Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY03.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 to $1M per year.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 03 - $8M; FY 04 - $14M; FY 05 - $14M; and, FY 06 - $13.9M.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M.  

An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.

Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for more information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 03-08-IFKA.

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori L. Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.

The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  

The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:

	a.  Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.  Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c.  Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.

Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer within 10 days of issuance of this announcement and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2006.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available aircraft stores loader.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, United States Air Force aircraft stores loaders are airframe specific.  Some are actually made by the unit causing equipment damage and personal injury. A single stores loader will reduce mobility footprint, logistics tail and increase effectiveness of loading capabilities on fighter aircraft. 

The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

	These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	A platform height range adjustable from 1” to 45”
2.	A total unit length not to exceed 108” and a width not to exceed 44”
3.	750 lb load capacity on raised platform
4.	780 lb total unit weight
5.	A simple elevation mechanism
6.	Able to withstand the rigors of towing and using in an all weather flightline environment

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from Industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.	Your interest to demonstrate your product.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 22 Oct 04 to MSgt Joseph Pratt, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  MSgt Pratt can be reached at (208) 828-3517.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks information from firms capable of providing Littoral Combat Ship(LCS) Mission Module development, integration and test capability in support of the United States Navy.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION from industry that will allow the Government to support and validate the government’s development of a long term contract strategy for LCS Mission Modules. The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as any obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any inform! ation submitted by respondents to this request.  To get the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and focused mission capability to the warfighter as fast as possible, an evolutionary acquisition strategy, driven by an accelerated schedule and today’s available technology will be used.  LCS Mission Packages will be optimized for flexibility in the littorals.  Mission package capabilities are currently focused on three primary mission areas: ·	Mine warfare (MIW) - emphasizing mine countermeasures ·	Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) – emphasizing the shallow water submarine threat ·	Anti-surface warfare (SUW) - emphasizing prosecution of small boats (SUW) The requirements are structured to incrementally deliver capabilities through spiral development.  Integration with the ship will be achieved by compliance to the PEO Ships Interface Control Document (ICD) and through close coordination with the ship design agent. The focused Mission Packages are developed and procured as a separate acquisition from the Seaframe (i.e., the ship).  The first Mission Package spiral increment provides capability for the LCS Flight 0 Seaframe with the government performing as system integrator.  PMS 420, the Mission Module Program Office, is responsible for integration, testing, certification, delivery and life cycle support of Mission Packages.  PMS 420 plans to involve Industry for spiral development.  The desired outcome of this RFI is to obtain Industry’s ideas for their role in supporting the LCS Mission Module Program.  The information obtained through this RFI will form the basis of discussions for an Industry day.  Details of the Industry Day, scheduled for November 3, 2004, are provided with this RFI.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide an opportunity for government and industry to collaborate on innovative contract strategies for the development, procurement and integration of mission modules/packages. Requested Input from Industry.  Industry is encouraged to submit information to PEO LMW (PMS420).  The following items are provided for guidance only in submitting input.  Information shall be submitted to PEO LMW (PMS420) via email to PMS420Calendar@navsea.navy.mil.  All responses are due by 18 October 2004.  In the event that industry provides information to the government that it does not want disclosed to the public, it shall mark the title page with the following legend:  ”This document includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to provide information to the government.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets].”  Industry shall mark each sheet of data it wi! shes to restrict with the following legend:  “Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.” 1.	Propose alternative contract strategies and business models, including the following: a.	Pros and Cons of single/multiple contractor(s) as Mission Package integrator b.	Innovative contract approaches that address the Navy’s desire to foster open architecture, open systems, and technology re-fresh and insertion. c.	Show why your alternative provides value to the U.S. Navy.  This is best done by proven benchmarks and metrics, where you can demonstrate achieving the required performance for the minimum amount of dollars. d.	Government/Industry Partnering. 2.	Answer the following questions: a.	As a Mission Package Integrator, how would you accommodate the development, integration, test and certification of new systems/capabilities from a variety of small and large companies?  Within the U.S.?  Outside the U.S.? b.	Outline the “scope” of a Mission Package Integrator and its relationship to the Seaframe contractor and the Government Laboratories? c.	As the Mission Package Integrator, how would you apply lean processes in your business model to ensure Best Value to the Government? d.	What are the benefits to the Government for continuing to use the Government Laboratories as the lead system integrator and how do you see industry playing a role in that construct? e.	If not the primary Mission Package Integrator, describe how, as an innovative company, you would desire to work with the Navy to integrate your product into a mission module. f.	Describe performance metrics that should be applied to a Mission Package Integrator and could be used for a basis of award fee. g.	How does the Navy determine that it is getting best value for spiral development?  h.	How should a Mission Package Integrator and PMS420 collaborate to decide what development occurs for each spiral increment? 3.	Provide Industry questions for the U.S. Navy to answer. Industry Day details.  The Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare and the Littoral Combat Ship Mission Module Program Manager, PMS420, will host a LCS Mission Module/Package Industry Day on November 3, 2004, starting at 0830, at the Anteon Corporation, 1100 New Jersey Ave., SE, Washington, DC.  Registration information shall be sent to lcsmm-industryday@anteon.com.  Deadline for registration is 25 October 2004.   Seating is limited, and therefore only individuals who pre-register will be guaranteed seating.  NAVSEA reserves the right to limit attendance.  Registration information must include the following information: company name and address, and the name, e-mail address, telephone number, and facsimile number for each attendee.  Only registrations from companies registered on the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) will be accepted.  This is an unclassified meeting. The format for the Industry Day will include briefs from PEO LMW, PMS420 and OPNAV representatives.  Industry inputs from this RFI (if not restricted) will be consolidated and briefed at the conference followed by a panel discussion.    Information exchanged may be used in preparation of one or more Request(s) For Proposal (RFP).  Supplemental Information.  Definitions: “Mission Package” =  Mission Modules + Mission Crew “Mission Modules” combine “Mission Systems” (vehicles, sensors & weapons), their support equipment, and standard interfaces. Mission Modules “plug into” Seaframe’s standard interfaces to provide focused mission capability.  Potential roles for industry partners. ·	Serve as overall technical agent supporting PMS 420 in developing Mission Module open architecture to facilitate rapid, flexible implementation of new technology. ·	Serve as primary technical agent to develop interface specifications and standards for Mission Systems within Mission Packages and between Mission Packages and the Seaframe Combat System. ·	Serve as the primary integration agent supporting PMS 420 in certifying Mission Packages meet Navy operational requirements and standards.  The integration agent should utilize existing test and engineering centers and infrastructure to the maximum extent possible. ·	Serve as the primary agent supporting PMS 420 in the management of an aggressive spiral development process that provides fair and open access to commercial, government and academia-developed technology from both domestic and international sources. ·	Manage the Configuration baseline (and changes), integration testing, certification and tracking of all mission systems, mission modules and mission packages for PMS 420.

<CONTACT>Gloria Golden Contracting Officer 5205380418     Gloria_M_Golden@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The Government is contemplating issueing a solicitation for the following requirement: (a)  As part of an interagency multiyear R&D effort to discover "novel intelligence" within the Intelligence Community's massive data sources, the Novel Intelligence from Massive Data program will establish and monitor the Glass Box that instruments the analytic environment.  Additionally, the Glass Box will be used to collect data to evaluate algorithms developed under other research components of NIMD.   Since the instrumentation necessary to capture the necessary information is still cutting edge and may require additional R&D, a commercial analytical environment paralleling an IC analytical environment has been chosen in order to provide researchers with access to unclassified data.   (b)  ARDA has launched a multiyear R&D program called Novel Intelligence from Massive Data (NIMD). NIMD's overall objective is to discover the "novel intelligence" that lurks undetected within our Community's massive data sources.  We define "novel intelligence" to be information that causes an intelligence analyst to gain new insight into a heretofore unappreciated or misunderstood threat. This information may emerge from discoveries in the content and patterning of new data, or discoveries resulting from "out of the box" analytical re-interpretations of existing data.  Novel intelligence often equates to "suspicious revelations" in one-time (or first-time) events, or in hidden connections between seemingly independent events or entities, or in puzzle pieces collected long ago, but that suddenly make sense in light of recent observations. (c)  This requirement will focus on development of the Glass Box Analytic Environment (GBAE) that is a NIMD "hub" task that encompasses the actual analytic environment.     The Government further contemplates limiting the number of offerors permitted to submit proposals for this requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii).  See Notes 22 and 25.  Interested parties must submit capability statements, including knowledge and experience with Novel Intelligence from Massive Data (NIMD).  This knowledge and experience is critical to avoiding significant duplication of costs and program delay.  Failure to provide this information will result in the submission not being considered further. See Notes 22.and 25.

B.	OBJECTIVE:
(1)	Technical Description: The Air Force Information Warfare Battlelab (AF-IWB) is an organization focused on introducing innovations in information operations to the operational Air Force. The AF-IWB accomplishes this mission by conducting operational demonstrations of IW concepts and evaluating their military worth. This BAA solicits concept papers with the potential to enhance Air Forceoperations within any element of information operations (IO).  These topics include, but are not limited to:  
(a)	Electronic Warfare Ops:  Electronic Warfare Operations are the integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the electromagnetic domain in support of operational objectives.
i.	Electronic Attack, 
ii.	Electronic Protection, 
iii.	Electronic Warfare Support
(b)	Network Warfare Ops:  Network warfare operations are the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital network portion of the battlespace. Network warfare operations are conducted in the information domain through the combination of hardware, software, data, and human interaction. Networks in this context are defined as any collection of systems transmitting information. This includes but is not limited to radio nets; satellite links; tactical digital information links (TADIL); telemetry; digital track files and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems; telecommunications; and wireless communications networks and systems.
i.	 Network Attack (NetA), 
ii.	Network Defense (NetD) 
iii.	Network Warfare Support (NS).
(c)	Influence Ops: Influence operations are focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of people, leaders, groups, or entire populations through protecting operations, communicating military perspective, and projecting information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in a modified behavior or a change in the adversary’s decision cycle.
i.	psychological operations (PSYOP), 
ii.	military deception (MilDec), 
iii.	operations security (OPSEC), 
iv.	counterintelligence (CI) operations, 
v.	counterpropaganda operations,
vi.	Public Affairs (PA) operations.
(d)	Proposed concept papers may also address new tactics, techniques, procedures, and mature technology applications that may affect Air Force IO doctrine and strategy.

(2)	Security Requirements: The submittal process under this BAA is intended to be as streamlined as possible in order to allow the government to leverage the latest technology advances.  However, every precaution must be taken to protect potentially sensitive or classified material.  Such material should not be transmitted across open-source media like public phone, fax, internet, or e-mail.  If a submitter has any reason to believe their concept may reference ideas or operations that require special protection, the submitter should immediately contact the Battlelab at commercial (210) 977-3030.  In general, potentially sensitive submissions should be sent via REGISTERED MAIL to the mailing address listed in Section A of this BAA, or via e-mail to the one or both of the following secure e-mail addresses depending on the classification of the sensitive information: 

	SIPRNet: IWInnovation@iwcmx1.afiwc.aia.kelly.af.smil.mil 
		or 
	JWICS:  IWInnovation@iswanmail.iswan.aia.ic.gov.  

Submitters who are supported by an accredited security office may be bound by specific laws and regulations directing the proper methods for transmission of classified concepts.
(3)	Other Special Requirements:
(a)	DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. ONLY CONCEPT PAPERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED. 
(b)	Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132. 
(c)	Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA. 

C.	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
(1)	Offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number.  
(2)	Non-government advisors will be used in the evaluation of concept papers and proposals.

(3)	Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply. 
(4)	Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact at AFIWBContracts@lackland.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.  Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this acquisition. 

D.	CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
(1)	The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.

<SUBJECT>59 -- FSC Code 5995 - Cable, Cord, and Wire Assemblies
<DESC>This notice announces a decision by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) to waive FPI’s status as a mandatory source of supply for items within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5995 - Cable/Cord Wire Assemblies.  FPI will continue to produce items within FSC code 5995, however, all sales FPI obtained for those items will be through non-mandatory means.  This decision is effective immediately.  This decision is the result of an earlier resolution by FPI’s Board to end the application of FPI’s mandatory source for products for which FPI’s share of the Federal procurements is 20 percent or more.
					
Mandatory source is prescribed by law.  In the past, the Board has exercised its authority to administratively determine how the statute should be applied.  It is within the Board’s authority to determine the conditions under which waivers of FPI’s mandatory source are to be applied.
The following guidance is being provided to facilitate the customer implementation of this action.

-  For products where FPI has waived the application of mandatory source, the market share acquired by FPI without the benefit of the mandatory source is considered a reasonable share. 

-     For those FSCs where FPI’s mandatory source is waived, FPI must be given full visibility of the requirement and afforded a fair and equitable opportunity to submit an offer to meet the customer’s requirement, to include being provided by Federal agencies the same information and specifications (as are afforded to any private sector offeror).

-  Such waiver is contingent upon FPI’s ability to submit an offer for these procurements.  Thus, consistent with the provisions of the Interim Rule Implementing Sections 811/819 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2003(Federal Register, November 14, 2003), such procurements must not be set aside for other programs, e.g., small business set-aside, nor may FPI be otherwise precluded from being able to submit an offer.

-  Notwithstanding the fact that customers are no longer required to purchase products from FPI as a result of the Board resolution waiving FPI’s mandatory source for products in which FPI has at least a 20 percent market share, there is absolutely no restriction or prohibition against the customers continuing to purchase from FPI, should they choose to do so of their own volition.  Thus, customers that currently rely on FPI to meet their product needs may continue to utilize FPI under the Board’s resolution.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534. Attention: FPI Board of Directors.

Any mounting pole shall be painted to match the existing decor as much as possible. Care should be taken to make the mounting as unobtrusive as possible. The NEC XP29 Plus 29" Multi-sync Monitor that lowers from the ceiling area over the defense table will require troubleshooting to determine the problem with the picture display. Two additional lecterns measuring 45" tall overall, with a work surface of at least 17"x24", on casters and in natural maple matching the rest of the court furniture as best as possible shall also be provided.
