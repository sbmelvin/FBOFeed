This is a notice of intent to sole source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The only known vendor with equipment meeting our needs is the 2 x Emed-m/E Sensor System manufactured by Novel Electronics, Inc.  The measurement reliability is critical to fitting our neural net models for prediction of hand forces based upon foot pose and pressure distributions.  The sensor mat must handle significant shear forces which can overstress the forcels and damage the row and column array; leaving blanks in the pressure array.  Emed is a capacitance sensor system that measures absolute values and is tolerant of shear forces of the magnitude our subjects will experience.  A system that does not have to be recalibrated for each subject is desirable.  

No solicitation is available.  Responsible sources that believe they have a similar product that would meet our needs specified above are encouraged to identify their alternate product and provide complete specifications for consideration.  The Contracting Officer will accept information for 15 days from the posting date of this notice.  

Forward all information demonstrating your capabilities to Denise Rains, Reference #000HCC35-2006-32609, CDC, NIOSH, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA  99207 or email Drains@cdc.gov.  The Government will review all product information provided and determine whether other equipment would meet our needs.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with Novel Electronics, Inc. as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.  All perspective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration  - www.ccr.gov to receive an award.

<CONTACT>ALFRED BENTON PURCHASING AGENT 7036487343     abenton@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center, La Crosse, WI has a requirement for a side scan sonar system in order to study fish habitat use in the Mississippi River. The bottom of the Mississippi River is predominately composed of sand with some silt. Waves form in the sand substrate, called dunes, are created by river currents and radiate perpendicular to the direction of flow. Dune heights can range from a few centimeters to two meters. It is hypothesized that fish use these dunes to avoid higher current velocities and possibly to acquire food. USGS scientists are hoping to use side scan sonar to identify fish position along the bottom of the Mississippi River in relation to these dunes structures.  (1) Scanning Environment: Depths: working depths in the Mississippi River range from 1.5 11 m, typically 3-6m , Survey Speeds: 3 knots, could accommodate slower survey speeds, Water Surface: wave heights generally <0.5m and often times 0m, should provide for greater platform stability but will negatively affect multi path echoes. (2) Target (Fish) Information: Dimensions 6-40 cm x 15-150cm, Location : 0-1.5m above river bottom, Density: soft tissue and air bladder, Orientation: typically parallel to flow (and track) direction (3) System Requirements: Range : narrow, area of interest  <20m, likely in the 10m range, Range Resolution: maximized, ideally able to separate targets with 5-10 cm separation, Transverse Resolution: maximized, ideally able to separate targets with 5-10cm separation (4) USGS- Provided Equipment: state of the art laptop computers, differential GPS units, some data acquisition software (already possess a license for Hypack software)   THIS AWARD WILL BE MADE UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES. The anticipated award date is 06/12/2006.  NAICS is 334511.  Request for Quotation No. 06ERQQ0043 will be available at the following website: www.ideasec.nbc.gov <http://www.ideasec.nbc.gov>. If you have difficulties accessing the solicitation using the website, call the National Business Center Electronic Commerce Help Desk at 703-390-6633. Responses are due by 06/07/2006.    Fax quotes may be sent to 703-648-7367: Attn: Alfred Benton. Question may be sent to Alfred Benton at abenton@usgs.gov. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See numbered note 1

<SUBJECT>B--Wildfire Risk Assessment at Cape May National Wildlife Refuge
<SOLNBR>501816Q012
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>06022007
<CONTACT>Marsha Browning Contracting Officer 4132538236     marsha_browning@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service invites Request for Quote for a Wildfire Risk Assessment to be performed at the Cape May National Wildlife Refuge in Cape May Court House, NJ. Cape May NWR lies within the NJ Pine Barrens Ecosystem, and is part of the Pinelands National Reserve, making the refuge a section of one of the most fire-adapted landscapes in the East.  The refuge currently manages approximately 11,000 acres; current holdings include the following forest types: pine-dominated maritime forest; mixed inland forests composed of scattered pitch pine, sassafrass, red maple, and sweetgum; bottomland hardwood and Atlantic white cedar swamps; and upland forests dominated by pitch pine and oaks.  The refuge recognizes that land units dominated by pines and fire-tolerant oaks or areas with an understory of ericaceous shrubs are naturally highly prone to wildfire, while wetlands or deciduous forests have longer natural fire return intervals.  The refuge also recognizes that factors other than vegetation composition contribute to wildfire risk, e.g. exposure, existing firebreaks, human population density, tree disease or insect outbreaks.  There is a critical need to identify and address the regions of highest wildfire risk on Cape May NWR.   A comprehensive assessment is needed, first mapping wildfire risk levels across refuge lands, then pinpointing where areas of high risk also threaten local communities or important refuge resources.   Finally, the refuge needs assistance in developing fuels treatment prescriptions for these high risk/high threat areas, in a manner compatible with refuge habitat objectives.  The contracted project will entail both GIS and ground-based components, including the following work:  1) evaluate current refuge holdings in terms of  risk of wildfire ignition and spread, using existing GIS datasets; 2) develop draft wildfire risk maps of the refuge; 3) deploy a survey team on the ground to gather site-specific information on fuel loads and forest conditions; 4) use this data to finalize wildfire risk maps (delineating areas of  "high" "medium" and "low" risk); and develop forestry/fuels management prescriptions for the areas of "high" wildfire risk.  The final product will be a report to the refuge, including risk zone maps, a list of priority fuels treatment areas, a summary of current conditions at those areas, and a list of recommended forest/fuels treatments, per priority area. Work is to be completed between August 1, 2006 and September 30, 2007.  The NAICS Code for this project is 115310.  All requests for the Package must be submitted in writing to the address above to the attention of Marsha Browning.  Requests may be faxed to 413-253-8450 and must include the name of the company, address, telephone and FAX numbers, and a point of contact and should reference the RFQ #501816Q012.  Issue date will be o/a 6/6/2006.  The RFQ is due at the above address by COB on 6/30/2006.

<DESC>The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testingflight-testing. A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated. This action will be unrestricted and open to all parties interested. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business employee size standard of 750. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 16 June 2006 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments to any and all documents.  The site visit is scheduled for Wednesday 21 June 2006 at 8:30 A.M. CST.  In order to participate in the site visit, contractors must contact the individuals listed at the end of this synopsis description for further instruction.  All specific information about the site visit will be given at that time.  Contractors must be prepared to provide the government with specific information for clearance into the IATF such as Name, SSAN, Clearance Level, Citizenship, DOB, POB, and Unit/Company Assigned.

Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of Advanced SATCOM Network Monitoring and Control Capabilities (ASNMC).

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee under the Two Stage Authorization Procedure, where the authorization of the first stage provides agreement on the physical scope, while the authorization of the second stage, normally to be sought by the Host National before contract signature at the latest, grants agreement on the financial scope and funds and therefore provides authority for signing the contract resulting from the competition.

The rough cost estimate of the current phase of the project is Euro 6.4 million ($8.2 million USD).

The project is expected to be completed after 19 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC).

The project, to be presented in the Invitation for Bid (IFB), will constitute a basic contract for immediate procurement and implementation and 2 optional slices for additional functionalities and procurement of more of the same type of systems. A fourth optional slice will be included to constitute a basis for possible future purchase of the same type of systems by NATO Nations.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of Euro 100,000. Should the selection and award procedure extend beyond the 12th month after the Bid Closing Date, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

The ICB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents, is NATO UNCLASSIFIED to the exclusion of the INFOSEC technical characteristics, which will be included in the IFB package, the security classification of which are NATO RESTRICTED. If classified material has to be included in the Bidder response to the IFB, the transmission of it shall be processed through the US Mission to NATO.

The successful contractor will be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET and only companies maintaining such a facility clearance will be eligible to bid on this project. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET.

Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of the subject systems to include hardware, software, documentation, testing, on-site training and transition on-site support. A one year warranty period will also be included for maintenance and support of the systems. Quotations shall be on a fixed price basis for the total of the contract. The Bidders will be also required to quote for the optional slices referring to additional quantity of the same equipment and one year CLS. These options will not be evaluated in the determination of the lowest bidder.

The solicitation will included a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their ability to undertake this project, and mandatory criteria for experience with the provision of a similar type of system.

The successful bidder will be required to achieve successful completion of FAST (Fist Article System Test) no later than 11 months after Contract Award.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Overall Requirements of ASNMC

NATO has identified the need for an Advanced SATCOM Network Monitoring & Control Capability (ASNMC) operating at Super High Frequency (SHF). That capability is to be provided by the ASNMC System.

The ASNMC functions shall be capable of operating in the context of multiple satellites (with a minimum of 2), multiple transponders, some split into multiple power sharing channels (for a total of up to 8 channels/transponders).

ASNMC equipment shall meet the environmental conditions that apply for operations involving land or maritime deployments. The INFOSEC function and the control messages exchanged between control entities over the air (i.e., between the Network Controller and controlled terminals) shall be secured in accordance with NATO Security Policy.

ASNMC shall support operations where users are all in the same coverage; such as Land, Maritime, NATO and where operations are spread under coverages that do not overlap and are cross strapped on board the satellite.

ASNMC shall support the following capabilities:

- Control and Management capabilities
- Satellite Engineering Order Wire including Secure Voice order Wire
- Spectrum Monitoring System Capabilities
- Message and information routing component

Deliverables of the ASNMC capabilities are further spread in two Steps. By Step 1, a limited number of terminals shall be fitted with at least Centralized Power Management Capabilities

Spectrum Monitoring System and Centralized Terminal Administration are currently planned for Step 2, as well as fitting all NSP2k ground terminals with ASNMC capabilities as appropriate.

ASNMC Main Components

ASNMC capabilities are distributed amongst the following components: Centralized Management Control Platforms (CMCP), Local Control Agents) (LCA), Satellite Engineering Order Wire (EOW) platform, and Spectrum Management System (SMS)

Centralized Management Control Platform (CMCP): A CMCP is hosted in each NATO SATCOM control center; SACC (active) and SBCC (back up). CMCP functions encompass:

- Network definition, configuration, and monitoring
- Link Power Control (LPC)
- Spectrum Monitoring System
- SNMP Administration
- Decision Support Capability

Local Control Agent (LCA): An LCA supports the function of control capability (typically unmanned) hosted in any Satellite Ground Terminal

Satellite Engineering Order Wire (EOW): An EOW platform supports the ASNMC Interaction Channels (IC). The controlling functions of any EOW platform are performed by the LCA located in the terminal in which the EOW resides. An EOW platform contains Control Channels (CC), mounted in a rack assembly. Associated with each EOW platform is a secure IP phone handset capability.

Spectrum Monitoring System (SMS): Spectrum acquisition and digital processing shall be undertaken at anchor terminals by SMS equipment, called SMS Digital Signal Processor (DSP). An SMS workstation, associated to the SMS DSP, shall enable the display of the Spectrum derived from its associated SMS DSP. This information shall be transferred to the CMCP, through the use of reliable communications protocol (File Transfer Protocol) via NGCS, to support Spectrum Monitoring functions including SMS data analysis and signal characterization at SACC/SBCC.

ASNMC Deliverables

The scope of the work encompasses the delivery of equipment within three contract slices, the first being firm, the others optional. An additional fourth slice is to be potentially used as a baseline between the selected bidder and any NATO nation.

Specifically, the contractor shall:

Execute the systems engineering, project management, quality assurance and configuration management requirements of the contract

Adapt an existing control and monitoring system design to the requirements of the technical specifications of this contract

Put such a design into production

Deliver the ASNMC capability in accordance with the Contract Schedule and ensure the preparation activities are completed in accordance with the installation requirements of the delivered ASNMC System. This in general involves test and evaluation of all the subassemblies, assemblies, components and parts, system integration and in particular involves:

- Ensuring that the delivered ASNMC capability is evaluated and approved by the - National Cryptographic Security Agency of the selected contractor and selected by SECAN
- Assisting the Purchaser in installing the ASNMC capabilities in two NATO Transportable SATCOM Ground Terminals (TSGTs)
- Installing the required central ASNMC capabilities at two Anchor terminals, called Static Satellite Ground Stations (SGS) and interfacing those capabilities with the SACC and SBCC
- Installing Reference Configurations at NC3A (The Hague, Netherlands) to support interoperability trials and testing
- Ensuring that the site installation/site preparation activities are completed in accordance with the installation requirements of the delivered ASNMC System
- Fully documenting the design, operation, installation, and maintenance of the ASNMC by providing the required manuals, supporting technical data, computer software and drawings required by the contract
-Carrying out an Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) Program
-Training Purchaser personnel in the operation and maintenance of the ASNMC
-Demonstrating that the ASNMC Systems meet the Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA) requirements of the contract
-Implementing and executing the warranty procedures required under the contract

The contractor shall provide all necessary resources to include services, personnel, materials, components, equipment, data and documentation needed to fulfill all contract provisions.

The contractor shall support and maintain the ASNMC in the Operational Evaluation period from Provisional System Acceptance until Final Systems Acceptance of ASNMC.

The contractor shall warrant the ASNMC and contractor-developed software after the date of Final Systems Acceptance.

Following successful completion of the ASNMC Warranty provisions of the contract, if the option(s) for Contractor Logistics Support is/are exercised, the contractor shall provide such support under the terms of the contract to be set forth.

<CONTACT>Kristen Hansen (360) 315-8445
<DESC>This requirement in support of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this requirement issued as a request for quotation is N00253-06-T-0153. The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 333921 and has a size standard of 500 employees.  Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport is contemplating award on a sole source purchase order to Kraft Telerobotics, Inc., Overland Park, KS.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all quotes received within 10 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to!   compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NUWC Division Keyport has a requirement to upgrade the Kraft Force Feedback Predator Manipulator to a Kraft Force Feedback Raptor Manipulator with Parallel Acting Jaws for the Triumph Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The ROV was brought up to current technological and functional capabilities two years ago. The Predator Manipulator that is installed is an early model and while still operational, is too large for the ROV and has limitations due to its physical size and proximity to the sonar systems, lighting and cameras.  Upgrading to the more technologically advanced and compact Raptor will enhance the dexterity of the system making the ROV more versatile and safer with greater flexibility.  The Raptor will still maintain a high level of power capable of lifting 500 lbs. and 200 lbs. at full extension.  Upgrade to in!  clude the following:  A. Exchange the 7 function Force Feedback Predat or Slave Arm for a 7 function Force Feedback Raptor Slave Arm.  The Raptor has a stand height of 36” in the stowed position as compared to the Predator’s 45” stand height giving an additional clearance of 9” from a sonar head and cables routed above. B.  Exchange the standard Force Feedback Master Controller and Hand Terminal for an Operator Control Unit with Force Feedback Mini-Master. The Mini-Master Control unit allows for left-handed or right-handed operation to comfortably control complex manipulations in an intuitive manner.  C.  Modify the existing Surface Electronics Chassis to incorporate the Operator Control Unit with Force Feedback Mini-master.  System is to be set-up for twisted-pair telemetry. Exchange the interconnect cables which connect to the Surface Electronics Chassis to the Control Unit. D.  Supply manipulator System Operations and Maintenance Manuals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement to demolish and remove an existing Helicopter Drive System (HDS) Test Stand System (TSS), and to fabricate and install a new Test Stand System using a government provided design data package. The Contractor shall be required to test and demonstrate the new system capability. This contract is in support of the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF), Bldg. 2360, at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River MD. In accordance with FAR 6.102(b), this acquisition is a full and open competition under NAICS code 332312. The contract is expected to have provisions for both Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee line items. The period of performance is estimated to be a maximum of two years. The major item in the PSEF is the HDS test stand, which is a structural steel fixture mounted on a concrete foundation. The stand has three tiers: a) bedplate on which the gas turbine engines and drive system are mounted, b) thrust bearing platform for simulating a lifting and bending load on the transmission and c) power absorption platform containing a large speed increasing gearbox and water brake system. Around the periphery of the stand and/or mounted on the cell’s walls are support systems and ancillary equipment and hardware. The current HDS test stand does not have a test article installation envelope nor the power absorption capability for testing the drive systems for new and upgraded weapons systems, such as the CH53K, AH1W/Z, VH-71A, CH47D/F and AH64D helicopters. The Government has created design changes to the HDS test cell and test stand to support the above test and evaluation requirements. The resulting design is a larger and stronger test stand, capable of withstanding the CH53 torque loads; a wide open test article installation envelope; a modular system to facilitate faster installation and removal of the varying engine drive systems; and a larger power absorption speed increasing gearbox. The test stand will also have a new torque measurement system and thrust load and shaft bending capability to simulate flight conditions. The Government will remove all test articles, test specific instrumentation, tail rotor stand, and main water brakes, and will clear the work performance area of benches, tool boxes etc. The contractor will responsible for all labor, services and materials necessary for the demolition of the existing test stand system and fabrication and installation of the new HDS test stand system in accordance with the Government-approved design package (GFI); installation of the Gateway Engineering Inc. 18,500 shaft horsepower absorption gearbox (GFE); and purchase and installation of the engine drive system, intermediate gearbox, tail rotor bedplates, a high volume pump for a cooling water reservoir, and a 500,000 foot-pound torque measurement system. The contractor will reattach cable trays and control panel boxes to the new test stand, reconnect power cords to equipment and control systems on the test stand, and integrate modifications made to the test stand with existing HDS facility systems and subsystems. The contractor will coordinate with the Government to develop a test plan and to conduct a checkout of the test stand system, subsystem, components, instrumentation and equipment to docuument the capabilities of the new HDS test stand system to the Government’s design data package. The contractor will also provide technical data and conduct on-site training. Site Visit -- The Government anticipates an informational site visit prior to formal RFP release to enable interested offerors to view the HDS facility to evaluate the scope of the requirement. Only one site visit date will be made available and interested offerors are highly encouraged to attend. No private tours of the site will be available. The Government will approve a maximum of two attendees per company. No foreign nationals or photography will be allowed. Companies wishing to attend the site visit must fill out a Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River Base Access Form The Base Access Form must be completed by each person wanting access to the base and site. Only those on the approved site visit list will be issued a NAS Patuxent River Visitor Pass. Substitution for a person on the approved list is not permitted. The site-visit is tenatively scheduled for 21 June 2006 at 1000 hours. Companies who plan to attend the site visit must contact Ms. Sandy Strong at email cecily.strong@navy.mil or phone 301-757-9765 to request an electronic Base Access Form and directions to the site visit location. Forms must be properly executed and returned to Ms. Strong not later than June 16, 2006.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to NOVA Power Solutions, 11367 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, VA 20190 for the acquisition of six (6) uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  The UPS(s) will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  It is a very new system that has just been installed at the Ingleside schoolhouse and USS Devastator this month.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  NOVA Power Solutions is the sole manufacturer for these UPS(s).  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts; so, time is an issue!  .  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the UPS(s) are acquired from NOVA Power Solutions.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to continue specialized scientific and technical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) support to the NASA Solid Earth and Interior focus area in the Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory. This support includes, but is not limited to, the following: 1) observation coordination, 2) data acquisition, 3) station support, 4) correlation, data processing and analysis, 5) data distribution and archiving, 6) technique improvement and research, 7) IVS activities, 8) computer support, and 9) combination of Space Geodetic data.   NASA GSFC intends to increase the maximum ordering value by $500,000 under Contract NAS5-01127 to allow for the extension of task order requirements beginning October 1, 2006. At this time, it is anticipated that VLBI task order requirements will be extended through December 31, 2006.  The maximum ordering value increase and task order extension are required to ensure uninterrupted support and to meet critical requirements until the follow-on competitive contract is awarded. While the competitive follow-on procurements are being conducted, NVI, Inc. must continue supporting the following critical requirements: coordination of VLBI experiments including requesting and scheduling of observing and correlating resources, generation and distribution of observing schedules and procedures and retrieval of observing logs; developing, implementing, documenting, and maintaining Field System software and procedures associated with Mark III, Mark IV, VLBA, Mark 5, S2 and various K4/K5 data acquisition operations at field stations; implementation and maintenance of VLBI stations including logistical support, preparation of standard and custom software, travel, verification of readiness, training, trouble-shooting, and assistance in data acquisition; preparation of experiments for correlation and processing of correlator output into data bases suitable for geodetic/astrometric analysis; and analysis and monitoring of station, correlator, and source performance.  This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. NVI, Inc. possesses the unique and specialized experience necessary to support the critical requirements until the follow-on contract is awarded. NVI, Inc. is the only company with the capability to provide the technical support without a reduction in service. In addition, specific areas wherein NVI, Inc. possesses unique knowledge not possessed by other vendors include:  evaluation of VLBI system performance and knowledge of the Mark IV Field system.	It would not be possible to duplicate or replace NVI’s expertise in the timeframe necessary to meet requirements.  The Mark IV Field System, which operates the VLBI data acquisition terminal and provides the interface to the station and the correlator, has been developed at Goddard by the incumbent contractor and requires detailed knowledge of the software functions, VLBI hardware, VLBI data acquisition and correlation procedures, and stations interfaces. In addition, it is not practical or cost effective to conduct a full and open competition for 3 months of support as a precursor to the award of a follow-on contract. Competing a contract for only 3 months introduces risks to the completion of critical requirements to support the Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory. The phase-in time and lead-time for new contractor personnel to become minimally experienced and functional to meet the government requirements will result in unacceptable delays.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 16, 2006. Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Anna Mustard, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-4556
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a purchase order, using FAR Part 13 procedures, for development of a document of model evaluation techniques and approaches.  The EPA's Atmospheric Modeling Division (AMD) periodically documents the performance of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model as part of annual model releases, with most of the analyses being operational in approach.  In addition, the Division regularly targets model predict issues and performs diagnostic evaluation tests to identify the cause of the problem  and improve the model.  Research is also ongoing to explore model evaluation approaches that consider the model's ability to simulate changes in air quality related to emission changes and also that consider the potential range of model predictions that may result from variations in model inputs or  specifications.  In addition to these activities described above, a broad array of model evaluation efforts is ongoing within the scientific community.  A document is needed to incorporate and summarize ideas from all model evaluation activities within the scientific community and synthesize these  ideas into more general presentation of a full suite of techniques and approaches that can help to provide comprehensive evaluation of air quality models.  The document must present and describe the range of approaches and techniques that can be used to evaluate air quality models.  The document  should include standard approaches used internally by the EPA's Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division, as well as additional approaches from the scientific community that futher expand the goal of comprehensive model evaluation.  It must also explain what information the varied approaches provide.   This work will require an individual with a strong background in air quality model evaluation who has the writing skills necessary to communicate effectively with scientific and management audiences.  Additionally, experience in air quality management is need to address the impacts of model  performance on air quality policy issues.   Period of performance will be from date of issuance of the order through September 30, 2007.

<DESC>The Program Support Center Acquisitions Branch knows of only a single source capable of accomplishing this requirement and intends to award a fourteen (14) month simplified acquisition for Federal Occupational Health to the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OHEPA), Ohio Division of Environmental Services (DES).  The proposed contractor demonstrates a unique and innovative concept not otherwise available to the Government.  The OHEPA/DES is already providing logistical, sampling, and laboratory analytical support in an identical effort at two monitoring sites in the vicinity of Marietta, Ohio.  Their existing collection effort will be combined with the proposed three additional sampling sites in support of the health study.  The knowledge, manpower and laboratory support, and capability already exists within the OHEPA; existing alternatives, if any, will add additional variables/bias to the study (e.g., two different laboratories).  The purpose of this requirement is to utilize that in-place logistical expertise and in-place laboratory analytical support provided by the OHEPA for the specific purpose of estimating monthly composite sampling levels for a heavy metals panel.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties capable of responding to the requirement may submit a capability statement specifically identifying their ability to accomplish this requirement.  Responses are due within 10 days after publication of this notice.  Responses shall be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with John Hopkins University, 615 N. Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD  21205 for continued laboratory services to perform assay testing for several large studies.  The HREB is working on a series of projects to evaluate new human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA diagnostics for cervical cancer screening and epidemiologic/clinical/prevention studies of cervical cancer that require HPB DNA testing.  The projects include:  Project 1. AMPLICOR and Linear Array for the triage of equivocal Pap smears (ASCUS and LSIL Triage Study [ALTS]).  John Hopkins University shall evaluate the clinical performance of LA and AMPLICOR for detection of CIN3+ and confirm HPV16 positivity as a biomarker of high-risk of CIN3+ among women who have ASCUS cytology;  Project 2. Evaluation of SPF10/LIPA assay for the Costa Rica HPV16 and HPV18 L1 VLP Vaccine Trial.  John Hopkins shall verify the analytic sensitivity of SPF/LIPA for detection of HPV DNA and compare to LA.;  and Project 3. HPV Testing to Improve Cervical Cancer Screening in the Mississippi Delta: The Mississippi Delta Project (MDP). MDP is a demonstration project to examine the technical feasibility of combining self-collection with HPV DNA testing as a clinically acceptable alternative to cytology for women living in the Mississippi Delta, a medically underserved population and John Hopkins shall  HC2 test specimens collected by new sampling devices to determine whether these devices provide any apparent advantage over Dacron swabs for detection of HPV, Provide HC2 and AMPLICOR testing of MDP specimens in accordance with the main objectives of the study, which is to evaluate whether self-collection and HPV DNA testing achieves at least similar clinical performance to cytology-based methods, and use LA to understand test positivity in MDP and adjudicate discordant test results for the two tests.  John Hopkins University was one of the developers of the PGMY09/11 assay that became the Linear Array and they are uniquely able to interpret and trouble-shoot this assay. They have an automated DNA extraction robot that is required and compatible with the PCR-based assays being used in this project. Since a lot of this testing is extremely complex, including  the real time testing of some specimens, the NCI and support-contract personnel need to be able reach the testing lab on short notice and with ease.  The proximity of the Hopkins lab makes this possible.  Johns Hopkins University has been a collaborator with the NCI on HPV-related projects since the early 1990’s.  To introduce another testing laboratory at this time would be detrimental to the continuity of the research in progress.  John Hopkins University is the only vendor known to the HREB that can process these samples without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Acquisition of Aushon BioSystems protein microarrayer 2470 a device for high throughtput "reverse-phase" protein lysate microarray production

Purpose/Brief History:
Molecular Therapeutics Program at the NCI needs to acquire microarrayer that is compatible to high viscosity protein spotting, namely "reverses-phase" protein lysate microarrays (RPA). The RPA was invented in the NCI in 2000 by scientists from Clinical Proteomics Program. In contrast to other protein arrays, the RPA requires the capability of handiling high-concentration and high-viscosity samples within a given amount of time to prevent samples from "during production" variations. Projects involve monitoring responses of many protein species across many samples in various bological/pathological contexts including identifying molecular target in chemotherapy. Changes at protein level are sometimes very small in which distinguishing signal from noise is extremely important. The Aushon 2470 protein microarrayer is the only machine that can achieve sufficient quality using such high-viscosity samples.

The Aushon 2470 protien microarrayer incorporated a series of requests based on collaborative testing with the alpha-unit. Proprietary solid-pin architecture makes remarkable reproducibility possible. The solid-pin performs an equal quality of printing no matter what types of solution including our high-viscosity samples. A built-in humidity control keeps sample concentration stable. The pin-uniformity provides an opportunity to increase the total pin number up to 48. All these innovative features allow users to make high-density RPAs.

In addition to the sample spotting advantage, the Aushon 2470 protein microarrayer is capable of holding 30 of 384-microtiter plates in the machine. All plates (where samples are) are kept under humidity control with lid while they are not being printed. The Aushon protein microarrayer can also print 50 slides at one run. The printing speed is remarkably increased so the time per microplate for the 50 slide set is still quick enough to keep the source samples retained (less than 65min per plate when 50 slides printed with 32-pin). 

Printing proteins requires a series of special conditions described above. The Aushon 2470 protein microarrayer is the only one that is designed for such demanding production. So far the CCR is able to print more than 10,000 features on a single slide and produce those 50 at a time in only 17 hours (when 32-pin used). All samples were protected from evaporation so the CCR can reuse the same set of microplates. The reusability will remarkably improve the degree of throughput in protein study with guaranteed quality of the arrays. The pin-uniformity also allows users making multiple small scale studies in a short period of time.

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

As stated above Aushon BioSystems is the only manufacturer of such an instrument (Aushon 2470 protein microarrayer) that can insure high-viscosity sample handling under fully controlled environment with the patent-pending solid pin architecture. The Aushon 2470 protein microarrayer is also the only one that can hold a set of 30 microplates, and print 50 slides at one run.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Acquisition of Amaxa Nucleofactor II/ HT 96 Shuttle System.

Purpose/Brief History:

Electroporation is a commonly used methodology for transferring nucleic acids, including RNA into cells.  The Amaxa system (a curvette based, low throughput system) is widely used by investigators at NCI particularly for transfection of cell types such as primary cells that cannot be transfected by other methods.  The mission of the Gene Silencing Section is to use the transfer of specific RNA molecules into cells to study gene function with a particular emphasis on performing this type of analysis on a high throughput basis.  The new Amaxa 96 well based shuttle and Nucleofector II system is the first electroporation system that has been developed that will enable us to perform high throughput based electroporation of RNA into cell types that many of our NCI collaborators have requested us to consider for large scale gene function analysis. 

Amaxa Inc. has developed a high throughput 96 well plate module that is the only one equipped to work with the current Amaxa Nucleofector system (serial number: 240-582), based on their proprietary discovery of how to insert transfected DNA and RNA into the nucleus of cells.  The Amaxa Inc. Nucleofector II and 96 Well HT Shuttle module work together to transfects 96 well plates of cDNA, shRNA and/or siRNA into primary cells and cell lines with transfection efficiency up to 90%.   This is accomplished by transfecting the selected target directly into the nucleus of the cells, followed by selection of specific electrical parameters which have been customized for individual cell types. Current commercial methods cannot provide this type of transfection efficiency, viability or flexibility. This company also has three separate patents pending which make their technology unique and not readily available from other commercial sources.  

The Amaxa Nucleofector II and the HT 96 well Shuttle Module can transfect both primary cell types and individual cell lines.  In addition to cDNA, shRNA or siRNA libraries (targets) transfection capability, the Amaxa 96 Well HT Shuttle module has the capabilities to transfect from 1 individual cell type up to 96 different cell types at a time.  The Shuttle also has optimized protocols to transfect selected targets at high efficiency and high cell viability into primary cells and cell lines.  These characteristics are unique to the Nucleofector II / Shuttle System.

The results can only be obtained by purchasing the HT 96 well Shuttle module that works with the current Amaxa Nucleofector II instrument. No other manufacturer has access to this proprietary Technology which includes the reagents and instrument.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Region II, intends to negotiate with New York Elevator and Electrical Corp., 519 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY on a sole-source basis for replacing and upgrading the control systems for two freight elevators at the Addabbo Federal Building located in Jamaica, Queens, New York. These varied elevator components must integrate with existing building design, space and appurtenances established for system repair or modification.   New York Elevator currently maintains the elevators at the Addabbo Building under a five-year contract as the on-site subcontractor to Brooks Range Contract Services, SSA's mechanical maintenance contractor.  New York Elevator installed and performed alterations to the existing system components in the elevators several years ago and is fully responsible for all aspects of the operation and maintenance of the elevators system.  Since the original equipment has been maintained by one contractor, New York Elevator, SSA intends to negotiate directly with New York Elevator company so as to comply with contractual (Maintenance & Warranty) agreements already in place, and ensure a smooth and rapid response and clear line of accountability for all mechanical breakdowns, thus minimizing disruption to operations, while maintaining limited down time of the Freight elevator system.  The new system is to be manufactured by Motion Control Engineering, Inc.  The use of Motion Control solid state signaling system is essential to the Government's requirements.  Building freight conveying systems are constructed on a customized basis to meet the working requirements and the building configuration.  Few manufactured items are common between various manufacturers' systems, meaning that systems from different manufacturers that operate to a proprietary design are not interchangeable with each other.  These are systems that must be integrated with existing building characteristics or agency operating requirements.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources that is submitted to the point of contact by close of business on June 13, 2006, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The entire solicitation will be available at the site for viewing or downloading.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register at the web site.  This will normally be the only method of distribution of amendments, therefore it is the offeror’s responsibility to periodically check the web site for amendments to the solicitation.  The official plan holder list will also be maintained on and can be printed from the web site.  Offerors MUST also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for the CCR is http://www.ccr2000.com.  Technical inquiries must be submitted in writing 15 days before proposals are due to the address listed above, or fax to 843-820-5819, Attn:  Sandy, Mulligan, Code OPT2AC-SM.  The Contractor shall provide services to complete renovation of Bldg. 585, MAG-31 HQ aboard the Beaufort Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, South Carolina and consists of the following:

a.	Complete renovation of existing administrative areas by providing new office floor plan, secure area with vault, and restrooms/locker rooms.   
b.        	New standing seam metal roof with associated supporting metal roof structure.
c.	Seismic upgrade of exterior and interior masonry walls.
d.         New mechanical and electrical systems throughout the facility.

Existing Conditions

Building 585 is the current MAG-31 Headquarters facility located at the Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, SC consisting of a single-story, concrete structure with 8” masonry infill, steel bar joists, and a lightweight concrete roof with mineral surfaced bitumen roof cover.  The existing exterior walls have an EIFS (exterior insulated finish system).  Asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are present and will be abated during the renovation.

Demolition

The following building components will be demolished:  select exterior windows and doors, interior partitions, existing restrooms, select mechanical/electrical systems, and various obstructions on interior and exterior wall faces in preparation for new finishes.    Select building CMU walls/EIFS will also be cut/sliced at approximately 32” spacing to facilitate reinforcement/seismic upgrade efforts.

Architectural

The building will utilize the existing exterior walls and existing concrete floor.  The exterior wall openings where demolished windows and doors existed will be in filled with reinforced masonry.  New office and corridor walls will consist of steel stud walls with gypsum wallboard on each side.  The interior side of all exterior walls will be furred and gypsum wallboard installed.  New exterior doors will be steel and new interior doors will be wood, both hung in steel frames.  A secure area will be added with steel mesh wall reinforcement under the gypsum board on both sides of the metal studs. A vault will be provided within the secure area constructed of 8” thick reinforced concrete and CMU.  The existing flat roof will be covered with a new standing seam metal roof consisting of a metal roof truss system, bearing on the existing structure.  The existing EIFS on the exterior walls will be repaired and receive a new finish coat.  

Structural 

The building’s concrete masonry units (CMU) do not meet current seismic criteria.  Reinforcement will be incorporated into existing CMU wall sections and will tie into the existing foundation and bond beams.  A similar upgrade technique, which utilizes steel flat bar shapes and wall fasteners, will be employed where unreinforced grout filled CMU wall construction or similar construction is encountered.  Additional shear walls (CMU and steel framed with plywood skin) will be constructed where new construction is provided and where it can strengthen the structure.  The existing roof system will be “X” braced along each exterior wall.
The new standing seam metal roof system design will utilize a performance type specification with contract and referenced as-built drawings.

Mechanical 
The new floor plan will necessitate the addition of new above ceiling water-source heat pump units and air distribution systems.  The existing condenser water pump, piping to well field, DDC head-end controls, sanitary sewer system (in part), and the domestic water system (in part) will be reutilized.  New plumbing fixtures will include water closets, urinals, lavatories, showers, and mop sinks.

Electrical

The building is served with secondary delivery voltage of 120/208V, 3 Phase.  New panels, wiring, and light fixtures will be provided.  The existing communications system will be reused with new telephone/data outlets added as required.  A complete addressable, supervised fire alarm system will be installed.

The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Y199, ConstructMisc Bldgs.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees. The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  Offerors will be evaluated on the following technical factors:  Factor A Past Performance (Phase I submittal will be utilized); Factor B Small Business Subcontracting Effort; Factor C Technical Qualifications (same as Phase I); and Factor D Technical Solution.  Technical is considered to be significantly more important than price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  THE SEED PROJECT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ABOVE.  The solicitation will be issued on or about June 9, 2006, with a proposal due date on or about July 10, 2006.  

A one-phase 100% plans and specifications selection procedure will be used.  The evaluation factors are technical solution, technical qualifications, past performance, and price.  
The contract will be for a term of five years consisting of one base year and four option years.  The estimated cost for this acquisition is between $55,000,000.00 and $60,000,000.00 for the five-year term of the contract.  Task orders will range from $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00.

In order to build the capacity development of the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC) requires that fire fighters receive training in the handling and disposal of HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials). These trained fire fighters will also receive train-the-trainer classes so they can oversee the training of other fire personnel in HAZMAT handling procedures. The ICDC is establishing better policies and procedures for the handling and disposal of HAZMAT. The fire fighters who attend this HAZMAT training will be able to conduct classes at the outlying fire houses to the other fire personnel. This capacity building is essential to reduce casualties among the fire fighters as well as the civilians at the scene of fire incidents (car bombs, chemical fires, and unidentified material spills). See the attached SOW for more information. The evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, will be past experience with providing HAZMAT training classes that meet U.S. standards, technical capability to provide this course in Baghdad Iraq, and price. Quotes are to be submitted electronically to 1Lt Francis Navarro at francis.navarro@pco-iraq.net.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) will conduct a competitive purchase for Digital Asset Management services to replace their current contract. The USPS requires supplier services to provide state of the art Digital Asset Management services. This should be a digital asset repository used to store and index all types of creative assets including art, copy, audio, video, and web media. Each asset is annotated with all information necessary to effectively govern its use. Essential needs include the integration of Asset Management database and transfer of all existing content from the current system, utilized by both internal and external groups and the ability for USPS to control and guide the creation of such an archive.

<DESC>This sources sought is a request for information. The information contained in this sources sought notification is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. Any significant changes will be provided in a subsequent Request for Information, if required. This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the United States (U.S.) Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). This RFI concerns transformation of a large software application written for the Sun Unified Development Server (UDS) environment, formerly known as Forte. DSCA is seeking to identify information technology vendors capable of transforming DSCA’s application source code into another programming language and is attempting to determine the degree of automation attainable in the transformation, the target environments that are obtainable, the degree of vendor experience with such conversions, and the degree of trustworthiness assurances that vendors are capable of providing.
Based on these results, DSCA may issue a second RFI to some or all of the vendors who respond to this RFI, seeking answers to more detailed technical questions and estimation of the approximate cost of the transformation.  Failure to respond to this RFI may preclude a vendor’s opportunity to respond to the next RFI. The large software application involved is called the Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS).  This application supports several business areas associated with the U.S. Government’s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, including preparation of contractual agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments and planning, tracking, and financial management associated with bringing tens of thousands of foreign military personnel to Department of Defense (DoD) schools in the U.S. DSAMS has roughly 893,000 lines of executable UDS-based source code and 223,000 lines of UDS-generated hexadecimal code representing 647 user screens.  Other elements of the application include an Oracle 9i database management system, custom reports developed using the Cognos Impromptu report generator, and interfaces programmed in Perl. The current hardware system architecture consists of: a central Hewlett-Packard HP V2500 Server running the HP-UX operating system, an Oracle 9i relational database management system, the UDS Runtime environment, most UDS-based DSAMS business logic (to include batch and on-line services), all Perl logic, and an Intel-based Windows server farm running the UDS Runtime environment, UDS-based DSAMS presentation and business logic, Impromptu, and Citrix Metaframe to deliver rich screens to end users’ Windows desktops via Citrix ICA client connections. DSCA’s Challenge.  
DSCA wishes to migrate the UDS-based client and server portions of DSAMS to another language, while retaining the Oracle, Perl, and Impromptu elements of the system and the user experience of rich screens.  DSCA also seeks to preserve, or enhance, the system response time.  The central application server and operating system for the transformed application code need not remain HP and Unix.  The objective is to transform the UDS elements of the system at minimum cost to a new, easily maintained environment.  DSCA is seeking a highly automated transformation with the expectation that it will reduce cost, transformation time, defect density, and subsequent acceptance testing and debugging. Trustworthiness Considerations, The DSAMS software application is a U.S. DoD information system.  The DSAMS application is regarded as unclassified and not sensitive.  The business data accessed and used by the DSAMS application is regarded as unclassified, but sensitive information.  Normally, for development or modification of such a system, DoD security regulations would require that the vendor be a U.S. firm and that each employee receive a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check with Interviews (NAC-I). DSCA recognizes, however, that some vendors possessing superior commercial UDS transformation automation and experience might exist outside the U.S.  A purpose of this RFI is to determine the extent to which sources capable of satisfying DSCA’s requirement exist, to determine if commercial sources can meet DSCA’s requirements, or if commercial sources can meet DSCA’s requirements if DSCA’s requirements were modified to a reasonable extent, and to determine the practices of firms engaged in the business of commercial automated UDS code transformation, particularly with respect to vendor’s capabilities to deliver trustworthy and reliable transformed applications.  DSCA’s Questions, DSCA is seeking short responses to this RFI, focusing on five major questions: Does the vendor have automation for transforming UDS source code?  If so, briefly describe the vendor’s capabilities for transforming UDS source code. Does the vendor have automation for transforming UDS-generated hexadecimal screen code?  If so, describe briefly the vendor’s capabilities for transforming UDS-generated hexadecimal screen code.  What target language(s) and presentation format(s) can the vendor’s transformation solution provide?  How many lines of code has the vendor successfully converted for clients that were: (a) UDS source code, and (b) UDS-generated hexadecimal screen code?  Briefly describe significant successful relevant experience with such code conversion projects. To what degree can the vendor, and the vendor’s employees, satisfy DSCA’s need for a trustworthy vendor who can be relied upon not to introduce malicious code
into the DSAMS application or compromise business data?  In this regard, please respond to the following sub-questions: In what country is your company based?  In what country will the work be performed?  Specifically, can the work be performed in a facility in the United States? What are the citizenships of the personnel performing the work?  Specifically, can the work be performed entirely with U.S. citizens?  If the work can be performed with U.S. citizens, does your firm have the capability to perform the code transformation described in this RFI with a U.S. citizen workforce with favorably adjudicated National Agency Checks with Interviews (NAC-I)?  Explain your response.   Is your company already performing work for the U.S. overnment?  If so, what trustworthiness provisions apply? Are there any commercial warranties that your company can provide regarding the trustworthiness of the delivered software code and the privacy of any operational data used in the testing process?   For those non-U.S. firms, or teams containing at least one non-U.S. firms, please indicate whether the non-U.S. firm(s) would cooperate in a review of the firm, its principals, and its employees by a U.S. government security or counter-intelligence organization as part of DoD’s supplier assurance program. How to Respond. DSCA is seeking short responses to this RFI.  Extensive descriptions of the firms or automated tools is not required.  Please limit your response to no more than ten pages. Responses should be received by DSCA’s contracting officer, Ms. Toye Latimore, by  July 3, 2006 at the following address: Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Attn:  Contracting Officer, 201 12th Street, South, Ste 203, Arlington, VA   22202, U.S.A.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: The NMFS intends to award a sole source purchase order to the U. S. Virgin Islands (USVI) Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) located in St. Thomas, VI. The order is for the creation of recreational fishing regulations in FY06. The DPNR, division of Fish and Wildlife, in cooperation with the St. Thomas/St. John and St. Croix Fisheries Advisory Committees, has been working toward revising the more the 20 year old fishing regulations over the past several years and adding recreational fishing regulations, which have never before existed in the Territory. The current project is a follow-up that will be funded in FY-06-07 to support the revision of recreational fishing regulations . This project is being initiated as a component of the NMFS’ efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The objective of this project is to address the revision of recreational fishing regulations in order to determine the manner in which fishing efforts will be limited or reduced in the USVI. Because the project is a follow-up to an on-going FY05 project, it will be realized in conjunctions with the on-going project. Once the project is complete DPNR will have a final draft of all fisheries regulations that can be submitted as part of any environmental review process leading up to the signing of the final regulations. DPNR is responsible for developing the content of environmental regulations related to the protection of the coral reef ecosystem and associated fishery resources in the USVI and serves as technical advisor to the local Fisheries Advisory Committees. DPNR has the personnel and ability to perform the work necessary for this project. USVI, DPNR is the only known source available to the NMFS to accomplish this project. USVI DPNR is a state agency. Its mission is to protect, maintain and manage the natural and cultural resources of the Virgin Islands. Activities such as fishing in territorial lands and waters of the USVI must be approved by and conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Government of USVI as enforced and implemented by DPNR.  The Commissioner of the DPNR is responsible for developing, approving and implementing regulations pertinent to the protection of natural resources in the USVI, including those pertaining to the management and the protection of fishery resources. Anticipated performance period is date of award through January 31, 2008.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This announcement is a request for information. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking information from sources that feel they are capable of providing off the shelf FM radio transmitter system that would be deployed on a tethered balloon and dropped from a fighter aircraft.  USSOCOM intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to evaluate candidate systems.  This project will evaluate a COTS FM Broadcast System that uses a tethered balloon concept for station keeping. The COTS system must be designed to deploy from a US fighter aircraft by means of a standard Mk-7/20 (PDU-5B) canister. The tethered balloon broadcast system must be suited for use under an existing cloud base or in darkness, and must have the ability stay aloft and broadcast untended for at least 5 days.  The FM broadcast system can weigh no more that 1.5 KG and must be able to transmit on any channel in the FM broadcast frequency band (87-105MHZ).  The information sought through this Sources Sought supports USSOCOM requirements for broadcasting messages into denied areas. All offerors products will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness in demonstrating the ability to place an FM Radio transmitter at a predetermined altitude for up to 5 days and transmit real or near real time messages to personnel on the ground. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

This requirement shall be interpreted to include all Messages 1-63 that comply with the packet format specified in ITU-R M.1371-2. Since IEC 62320-1 Ed. 1 CDV, Section 10.2.1.11 tests only the current AIS Messages 1-24, the manufacturer shall provide evidence (in the form of an illustrated technical explanation) that the receiver is designed to satisfy this requirement for future Messages 25-63. 
5.	The NAIS Base Station Receiver shall be tested and certified by the manufacturer to meet the applicable parts of IEC 62320-1 Ed. 1 CDV and the USA Comments within the limitations of this specific application. The manufacturer shall provide a Certificate of Compliance and verifiable (including rights of inspection) documentation in the form of test measurement setup and test results demonstrating compliance with this requirement.

<DESC>Synopsis:  The Trainer Aircraft Systems Group (TASG), Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is conducting a market survey of potential sources to provide both T-6A aircraft Sustaining Engineering support and follow-on Production of Berry Amendment Compliant T-6A aircraft and related aircrew training devices (ATDs).  This synopsis is essentially a repeat of a synopsis posted last year (05R615 - 15--JPATS Production Contract Follow-on posted 2 May 05) except for the addition of the Berry Amendment Compliant requirement.  The TASG is attempting to gather the most current information on the trainer aircraft marketplace.  
Background:

The JPATS is comprised of T-6A aircraft, T-6A ATDS, a Training Information Management System (TIMS), and courseware. Under the JPATS program, the T-6A aircraft is replacing the US Air Force (USAF) T-37B and US Navy (USN) T-34C trainer aircraft.  As a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, the T-6A is a low-wing, high-performance, pressurized, turboprop trainer aircraft.  It is designed to take advantage of commercial aviation technology to meet US Government training system requirements.  Complementing the aircraft are five types of T-6A ATDs: an Operational Flight Trainer with a wide field-of-view visual system, an Instrument Flight Trainer with a narrow field-of-view visual system, a Unit Training Device with no visual system, an Escape System Trainer, and an Egress Procedures Trainer.  None of these ATDs are motion-based.  The JPATS will provide entry-level student pilots with the skills necessary to complete contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and navigation missions during both day and night conditions.  Training in the JPATS will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.  Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), the JPATS prime contractor, began building the first T-6A aircraft for the US Government in 1996, and has been delivering these aircraft since 2000.  Under subcontract to RAC, the Flight Safety Services Corporation began building the first T-6A ATDs in 1998, and has been delivering them since 2000.  The T-6A aircraft and ATDs completed initial operational testing in 2002.  The USAF achieved its JPATS initial operational capability in 2002 and the USN followed in 2003.


Current Environment:  

Previously-awarded US Government production contracts have procured 418 T-6A aircraft and 83 T-6A ATDs.  These JPATS assets will be deployed to USAF or USN training wings and squadrons at several different locations.  The T-6A aircraft will be supported by a separate Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) services contract which is not part of this market survey. The contemplated follow-on Production contract will procure at least another 220 T-6A aircraft and 24 T-6A ATDs over the course of three years if all options are exercised, US Government fiscal years 2007-2009.  Planning is in place to extend production through 2013.  For seamless training operations, the additional T-6A aircraft and ATDs must be nearly identical to those already produced.  In addition, the TASG needs to make several Class I engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and ATDs to remedy user-identified deficiencies, mitigate the discovery of obsolete parts, or adjust the performance of the aircraft and ATDs to match evolving user mission requirements.  These Class I engineering changes will include changes to production configuration as well as retrofit of fielded assets.  Therefore, the TASG intends to procure Sustaining Engineering support as major part of the follow-on Production contract.  Potential sources are advised that Raytheon Aerospace Corporation (RAC) still owns design rights to the T-6A aircraft and peculiar support equipment.  RAC is currently the sole provider of studies, analysis, and Class I and II engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and ATDs.  RAC also provides all maintenance support for the US Government’s prototype aircraft (PT-4), crash damage repairs to fielded aircraft, and system/sustaining engineering support of the entire JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS): ATDs, TIMS, and courseware.    

Contract Requirements:  

1.	3 lots of T-6A aircraft,  a minimum 202 in total, if all options are exercised. (There is a potential for 4 additional lots of T-6A aircraft,  a minimum of 163 more in total, if additional funding is authorized).
2.	3 lots of T-6A ATDs, a minimum 24 in total, if all options are exercised. (There is a potential for 4 additional lots of T-6A ATDs, a minimum of 14 more in total, if additional funding is authorized).
3.	Simulator Servers as required, to integrate the ATDs with the remainder of the GBTS.
4.	Future studies and analysis against aircraft and ground-based training equipment deficiencies and product enhancements.
5.	Maintenance support for the prototype (PT-4) aircraft located at RAC in Wichita, KS.
6.	Support for the development of new product enhancements for JPATS.
7.	Crash damage repair as required for any fielded aircraft.
8.	Onsite field service representatives at main operating bases to assist in maintenance support.
9.	Navy aircraft spares outside the typical COMBS Services contract requirements.
10.	Engine Structural Integrity Program and Aircraft Structural Integrity Program support.
11.	GBTS integration & systems engineering support.
12.	Dedicated engineering support to address deficiency reports, and miscellaneous program management planning.
13.	Incidental aircraft pilot training, GBTS user training, aircraft maintenance training, and FIREFAM training.
14.	Engineering changes to be cut-in to production aircraft and ATDs.
15.	Aircraft hardware or software changes for production and fielded assets.
16.	Parts obsolescence management.
17.	Unit Identification Markings on spares.
18.	Integrated Support Planning to include strategic planning, cost estimating, master scheduling, and expenditure forecasting.
19.	Technical Manual updates and reports.

This project will provide Environmental and Preventative Medicine Unit laboratories (Industrial Hygiene, Environmental Health, Epidemiology, Microbiology, Entomology, and Force Health Protection), administrative and logistics functions, education/training classrooms, and environmentally controlled storage for expeditionary equipment and supplies.  The project includes construction of a vehicle shelter and support facilities of site work utilities, sidewalks and parking.  The work also includes facilities that comply with the requirements for Biomedical Safety Level 3, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control/National Institute for Health publication Biosafety in Microbiology and Biomedical Laboratories.  Requirements of a Biomedical Safety Level 3 Laboratory include seamless walls, ceilings and floors that are impermeable to liquids and resistant to chemicals and disinfectants normally used in laboratories.  Penetrations in floors, walls and ceilings are to be sealed or capable of being sealed to facilitate decontamination.  A specialized ducted exhaust air ventilation system is required which will create directional airflow that draws air in to the laboratory from “clean” areas and toward “contaminated” areas.  Exhaust must not be recirculated to any other areas of the building.  The design, construction and operational procedures of a Biosafety Level 3 facility must be documented and tested prior to operation and must be re-verified annually.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine sources with the capability and availability to meet requirements of US Coast Guard District 8, Sector New Orleans Incident Command Operations during the 2006 Hurricane Season for the contractor to provide a facility for the sector to set up a 24/7 operational command post.  The US Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is the procuring office for this action.  In an event of the possibility of a Category 3 to 5 hurricane, during the hurricane season, US Coast Guard SECTOR New Orleans’ Incident Command Post (hereinafter ICP); which is a 24 hour 7 day a week operational command center; will need to be stood up in to a safe location that is away from current hurricane and potential future hurricane hazards and dangers.  This facility will also need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead US Coast Guard post hurricane operations.  The US Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the “first right” to use the facility as an ICP in an event of a Category 3 or more hurricane to hit the Gulf shore resulting in evacuation of New Orleans, LA.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a category 3 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for eventual ICP stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation, and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit the New Orleans area, this will require that USCG Sector New Orleans stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  Sector New Orleans will be forced to reconstitute full operations from this satellite location.

The requirements for the facility are as follows: 
The ICP location needs to be within at least 100 miles and up to 250 miles North of District 8’s SECTOR New Orleans located downtown New Orleans. Hospitals must be near by in addition to other basic amenities (commercial airport, availability of food) if the Coast Guard cannot return to their office in downtown New Orleans.  Office space/conference rooms - four office/conference rooms to house a day/night, 24-hour watch.  One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 22,000 square feet and the other three rooms must be no smaller than 120 square feet. The 22,000 square feet office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 80 phone/fax lines and 80 internet connections spread out in the room.  The three smaller conference rooms (no smaller than 120 square feet) must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 phone lines and 5 computer lines.  The Coast Guard must have the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows. The facility shall provide tables and chairs for at least 250 people.  The 22,000 square feet conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to have 100 electric outlets distributed throughout the room.  The other three smaller conference rooms must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 electric outlets distributed throughout each room.   Up to 250 hotel rooms may also be needed, therefore the operational facility must be within walking distance (1/2 mile) from hotels that could accommodate this number of rooms.  Parking will be needed for up to 300 vehicles. The office/conference facility should be near locations or have the capability to serve full nutritious meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner and midnight rations (finger food) service. 

It is the Coast Guard’s intent to issue a BPA (blanket purchase agreement) to obtain services.
Interested sources should provide the following information via to the address below.  
Name of Company and Address, Point of Contact and phone number, Distance from New Orleans, List of Hotels and capacity that are within walking distance (1/2 mile from facility),   Business Size (small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business or  women-owned small business concerns).  

The NAICS code is 531120 (rental of building, non-residential).   The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.

The period of performance is anticipated for June through November 2006 with options to extend up to 6 month.  No other sources sought notice will be provided.  Interested vendors should respond to this notice by Close of Business June 6th, 2006.  Competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research.  At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation.  

This notice is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>The following numbered paragraphs were left out of the original synposis for this acquisition, they are provided at this time to allow offerors to better asses their interest. 7.  SDSL connectivity.  The modules must have SDSL connectivity in point-to-point mode over 4 miles of single pair WD-1 or WF-16 field wire between two CBMs, providing at least 1.8 Mbps throughput in both directions, simultaneously.  Military standard quic k connect binding posts with auto polarity sensing terminals are required.  DSLs should fail to pass traffic if there is any attempted tapping into the line.  8. CAISI bridge module affordability.   This solicitation is currently limited to the radio, and  the switch for a single enclave of 39 CBMs.  At this time the U.S. gGovernment will not consider any radio and switch for a CBM that costs more than $1500 for  both when purchased in quantities of 1000 or more.    9.  Module weight.  The total weight per module may not exceed 46 pounds (including all components of the CBM and the transit case).  The weight of the radio and the 8 port switch combined must not exceed 8 lbs.  The weight of the radio and antenna compone nts that will be attached to a mast must be as low as possible to avoid the additional requirement of fielding a mast kit to accompany each CBM.   10.  Volume.  The cubic feet per module may not exceed 3.7 cubic feet (including the transit case and antenna).  The volume of the radio and the 8 port switch combined must not exceed 300 cubic inches. 11.  Extension of antenna.  Each module must have the ability to extend the antenna at least 60 feet from the module.  The current CBM includes 25- and 35-foot sections of RF cable, and a barrel connector to allow each section to be used together.  The Arm y has pre-selected and will provide the RF and CAT-5 cables that will be used during the evaluation of the vender radio and switch components.  The cable must be UV resistant for outdoor and rugged use.  The current cable is super flexible foam diaelectric  3/8 Andrew FSJ2-50 series.  Including the signal loss in the internal cable, the lightning arrestor, and the barrel connector, the total line loss at 5GHz frequency operation is approximately 6 dBi for 60 feet.  If the radio is a separate component from the switch then power over Ethernet (POE) can be used to achieve this extension distance over a CAT 5 cable instead of an RF cable.  12.  Ethernet switch ports.  Each module must have at least eight 10/100 Ethernet ports for wired network devices.  The switch ports must be auto sensing and auto uplink RJ45 ports.  The candidate solution must support port based access control. If the ra dio does not include the 8 switch ports the radio can be accompanied with a separate manageable switch that is IEEE 802.1x compliant.   13.  Power limitations. Each CAISI bridge module (CBM) includes an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to support for the Radio and switch devices in the CBM in case of power outage.  UPS used in the CAISI is a Tripplite model 300i Internet which is rated f or 300VA, 185Watts.  The candidate switch and radio must remain fully operational for at least 20 minutes using this UPS.  14.  Temperature.  The radio module that is intended to operate outside on the mast must be capable of operating between temperatures from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius.  If a switch is separate from the radio it must be able to operate from 0  45 degrees Celsi us.

<SUBJECT>Network Assessment
<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to L. Sims. NETL is seeking to develop a comprehensive network view assessment of key players, leading studies, and methodologies that can serve as quality benchmarks for work on adaptation of energy systems (as complex engineered systems) to changing climate.  Little has been written directly about adaptation within the energy sector to climate change.  Most of the information is likely to exist in works focused on other, related problems.  The purpose of this activity is to survey key literature and to identify â€œthought leadersâ€, beginning with materials provided by NETL, and to prepare a report on the issues, methodologies and tools related to climate change and adaptation strategies for the energy sector focusing on the constraints and the trade-offs between technical, socio-political, and economic drivers.  List possible tools and relevant studies by those who are key performers in assessing approaches to understand both the impacts of change, who may be estimating costs of such impacts, or seeking to identify measures that might reduce these costs or approaches that might limit damage to natural systems. Please note, this is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) and NO competitive solicitation will be issued as result of this notice.  See FEDBIZOPPS Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>D -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>This notice announces that the Secretary of the Senate (SOS) intends to award a contract without a competitive procurement to the existing Lobby Report System (LARS)support contractor (TRKC Inc.), for an amount not to exceed $100,000, for continued development and support for the LARS.  In February 2000, a competitive procurement was conducted and an award was made to TRKC Inc. for the design, development, implementation, documentation, upgrade, and maintenance of the LARS.  TRKC Inc. as the software developers and the original authors of the LARS have been maintaining and enhancing the LARS since its original development in 2000 and they are uniquely qualified to perform the contract.  Currently lobbyists must file semi-annual reports in electric form.  As of January 1, 2007, SOS anticipates that lobbyists shall be required to file reports quarterly and in electronic form.  The SOS must create a searchable, downloadable, and sortable public database with the information disclosed in these reports.  TRKC, Inc. development efforts will require: a) supporting the design of a searchable database and the conversion of archived and future LARS data into the database.  The filing form will be an XML form created by IBM (which acquired PureEdge tools), developed by the Clerk of the House with Secretary of the Senate input; b) development of a middleware application and Data Base to support the XML front-end of the LRS which pulls data from the XML form, stores, and renders it for public viewing; c) extract data and images from the SOS Public Records legacy data base; and d) retain all current LARS searching functionality and develop additional capabilities to be determined by the passage of the Lobby Reform Act of 2006. Under the contract, TRKC shall deliver a tested fully functional searchable LRS no later than December 1, 2006.  There is no solicitation document.  This notice is not a request for quotes. Companies, with a minimum of five years Lobby Disclosure Act expertise and five years demonstrated lobby reporting system development experience along with the ability to complete the project on time and within the stated budget, interested in this opportunity may send a capabilities statement to the attention of Kathleen M.Haddow at Acquisitions@saa.senate.gov .  Capability statements must be received by this office within 10 business days from publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>26 -- TIRE PRIVATIZATION DRAFT RFP NOTICE IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE
<DESC>THIS IS A DRAFT SOLICITATION NOTICE.  Under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a DRAFT RFP for the Tire Privatization Initiative on Friday, June 2, 2006.

The purpose of this Draft RFP is to solicit sources and comments to the RFP for supply chain management of tires for the Department of Defense.  Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes (FSC) 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function. The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  This Draft RFP is for informational purposes only.  The Government will not accept offers as a result of this Draft RFP.

The acquisitions will use two Long-Term Fixed Price Requirements contract, five year base period with one-five year option period, with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) provisions. The EPA provision is limited to a maximum increase of 7% per year. One acquisition will be for the supply of FSC 2610 and 2630, and the other acquisition will be for the supply FSC 2620.  IAW FAR 2.101 the contracting officer has determined the tires to be purchased under this solicitation meet the definition of commercial items and will be solicited under FAR Part 12.    

Written comments will be accepted until June 23, 2006.  Anyone interested in being added to the potential offeror’s list may register as follows.   

To register, please send an email to Kathy Manley (614)692-2258, at DSCC.Tires@dla.mil with your company name and address, CAGE code, and a primary point of contact to include telephone number and e-mail address. A return email will confirm your registration.         

Schedule: This Draft solicitation will only be available on this web site until 23 June 06.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number 2006-N-08555 is being issued as a total small business set-aside, Request for Proposals (RFP). RFP 2006-N-08555 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09. The associated NAICS code is 518111 and the small business size standard is annual receipts of no more than $23,000,000.00. The proposed contract action is for services/supplies which the Government intends to acquire utilizing total Small Business Set-Aside solicitation procedures; this notice of intent is a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested persons or organizations may submit a proposal for this RFP. The Government will evaluate proposals only from organizations that are certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration as small business concerns. If the Government’s evaluation reveals that none of the small business concerns are technically acceptable, then the Government will evaluate proposals from all offerors (regardless of their size status). Each offeror must identify and certify its size status in the Representations and Certifications submitted with the proposal. All proposals received within fifteen days after date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, therefore an offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and price perspective. Discussions, if held, will be conducted only with those offerors determined to be within the competitive range. Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the proposal determined to be the most advantageous, and providing the best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Request for Proposal. Offerors are advised that in the proposal evaluation process, technical merit and other non-cost factors will be more important to cost or price. If, as a result of technical evaluations, proposals are judged to be essentially equal then cost or price shall become the determining factor. 

I. BACKGROUND AND NEED: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) serves as the national focal point in the efforts to prevent disease, injury, disability, and premature death and to improve the overall quality of life of U.S. citizens. To accomplish its mandated mission, CDC provides financial and scientific assistance to local, state, national and international prevention efforts in the basic disciplines of epidemiology, evaluation, prevention effective, surveillance, behavioral and and laboratory services. The CDC must be able to recommend effective health promotion and protection programs that generate or lead to justifiable benefits for the resources expended. To this end, the agency must ask and find answers to three fundamental questions: (1) What strategies work?, (2) How much does it cost?, and (3) What is the return per dollar invested? The Prevention Effectiveness and Health Economics Branch (PEHEB), Office of Workforce and Career Development coordinates and provides leadership to CDC officials on prevention effectiveness activities at CDC. Activities performed in support of PEHEB’s mission include: (1) Development of the overall conceptual framework for prevention effectiveness; (2) Training CDC staff to conduct assessments of the effectiveness, economic impact, and economic efficiency of prevention strategies; (3) Development of public health policies and recommendations based on the results of prevention effectiveness assessments; and (4) Collaboration with and provision of technical assistance to agency Centers/Institutes/Offices (CIOs) on studies designed to assess the cost and effectiveness of prevention programs. The latter objective, providing technical asistance to CIOs assessing the cost and effectiveness of prevention programs, is crucial to the judicious allocation of scarce public health resources. Federal, state and local health decision makers need to know the costs of prevention programs and the effects of such programs on the health of the populations targeted for the intervention. The comparison of different health
strategies and decisions is dependent upon reliable and consistent cost effectiveness and cost benefit data. PEHEB has been specifically tasked with providing direct medical costs attributale to the following health outcomes: (1) meningoccocal disease and vaccination, (2) deadweight losses of antimicrobial resistance, (3) testing for HPV to enhance accuracy of cervical cancer screening, (4) rotavirus, (5) diarrheal illness, (6) influenza, (7) salmonellosis, (8) Hepatitis A, (9) diabetes, (10) broncholities, and (11) job-related upper respiratory illnesses. It is the Government’s intention, to acquire access to data, which is demographically representative of the nation, and characterizes medical claims paid by private sector providers for inpatient, outpatient and pharmaceutical health care services; procure appropriate software with which to manage and analyze the data; and remote research and technical support for users of the system (data/software) on an as-needed basis. The professional services and supplies required by this combined synposis /solicitation are a continuation of a three-year effort which utilized data and software provided by the MEDSTAT Group.

I.  
On behalf of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), I request purchase of NX Open Runtime Package and FEMAP with NX Nastran software, training coupons and support to develop specialized applications specific to the Center’s Imagery Systems Branch (NASIC/DEIT).    NASIC/DEIT has a requirement to enhance its Unigraphics Computer Aided Design (CAD)/Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)/Product Data Management (PDM) system used by several Center directorates.  The software is used to support the implementation and integration of imagery exploitation methods and processes.  It supports Science and Technology imagery exploitation, facilitating image analysis.  The end user of the requested software provides corporate wide support for Unigraphics NX engineering.  The software is also used to provide custom tailored digital image products. The requested software, service and training (O&M) is the continuation of the out year Presidential Budget Tier III funding for the CAD software replacement.  The training is for new and advanced users to ensure efficient utilization of the PDM system and proficient intelligence production.

II.
These CAD/CAE tools and services will help meet the Imagery Systems CAD and Engineering Analysis requirements. The essential/salient features are:

1.	Use CAE/thermal analysis to determine characteristics and performance of foreign threat systems.
2.	Provide 3D mesh models to various GOTS analysis tools.
3.	Provide a site-wide collaboration environment for 3D geometry analysis models.
4.	Enable access to custom applications for CAD/CAE workstations not connected to the license server.

III.
There are only two known sources able to satisfy the government’s requirements. For the specific software, training and support required, Unigraphics (UGS) authorizes Lockheed Martin and Enterprise Solutions Corporation (ESCgov) as certified resellers.  

IV.  
NASIC/SCXA management, requirements and acquisition specialists, as well as users continue to monitor the business market to ensure knowledge of other, less expensive, technically superior, or more readily responsive vendors on similar IT products.  NASIC/SCXA will continue to attend trade shows and conferences, review publications and trade journals, and talk with other users in order to remove barriers when future acquisitions are required.  As the Center identifies new requirements, we will make every effort to compete new purchases.

Such programs can include, but are not limited to, deployment of American police officers in multilateral police assistance missions (CIVPOL), bilateral training programs, deployment of mentors or other technical advisors, and provision of infrastructure and equipment assistance.  

INL/CIV also participates in interagency and multilateral efforts to improve the quality of U.S. and international responses in stability and reconstruction environments, including seminars and workshops, lessons learned reviews, strategic planning activities, war games and interagency exercises, and contingency planning for possible future operations.

 Required Services - The successful contractor shall be capable of providing pharmacy technician services as follows: prepares prescription orders for pharmacist’s or physician’s review and verification; inventory and stocking of pharmacy supplies; maintain pharmacy refrigerator temperature logs; check medications for expiration dates; monitor accountability of needles and sharps;  assists pharmacist in proper disposal of expired and confiscated medication; assists in the orderly running and general cleanliness of the pharmacy area; assist pharmacist with the gathering of information for various reports.  The contractor will further perform any additional services, as required by the Chief Pharmacist, Health Services Administrator or appointed designee, that are normally performed in the commercial scope of practice for this service.  Additional services may include administrative and clerical tasks.  

Routine Supplies  - In recognition of institution security concerns, routine supplies and equipment that the contractor may need while at the institution will be furnished by the Government.  If the contractor requires special equipment or supplies, a written request may be submitted to the Health Services Administrator for consideration.  Additionally, the Government will furnish all required Government forms to be used in the performance of services.  All records maintained by the contractor under this contract will remain the property of the institution.  

Place of Performance - Contract services will be provided on-site in the Health Services Units located at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Elkton, located at 8730 Scroggs Road, Elkton, Ohio.  FCI Elkton is a low security facility housing approximately 1900 federal male inmates.  Additionally, FCI Elkton operates an adjacent satellite camp which houses approximately 600 minimum security male inmates. 

Minimum Qualification Requirements - Contract personnel performing pharmacy technician services must be a high school graduate and possess a minimum of 2 years of experience (within the last five years)  working as a pharmacy technician.  

The contractor shall provide, with their quote, the name of the candidate(s) that will be providing services for FCI Elkton and photocopies of documents evidencing their own and/or their candidate(s)’ ability to meet qualifications to perform required services as stated in this SOW.  Examples of documentary evidence include a copy of high school diploma or equivalent, letters of recommendation, certifications, resumes, etc. 

Performance Schedule - The contractor will perform between ten (10) to thirty (30) sessions per week (number of sessions shall not exceed thirty (30) sessions per week or 120 sessions per month).  Each session is defined as one (1) hour in length.  Sessions will be scheduled between the hours of 6:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. The scheduled hours will be mutually agreed upon by the Federal Government and the contractor; however, the total number of hours performed by the contractor is not likely to exceed 30 hours per week. 

Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be expected.  Such delays may include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters. When contract employees report to the institution but are unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for one (1) session.  Normally, any remaining sessions for that day will be suspended, the contractor will be free to leave, and the contractor will not be paid for remaining unformed sessions.  However, if the institution requests that the contractor remain at the institution for eventual performance, the contractor shall be paid for such sessions. In the event it becomes necessary for the Government to cancel a scheduled session, the FCI will attempt to provide the contractor with 48 hour written or verbal notice prior to cancelling a session. When advance notice is given, the Government will not be subject to payment for cancelled sessions. 

Restrictions on Contract Workers - The contractor shall not supervise inmates; supervise Bureau of Prisons staff; participate in inmate accountability; requisition, sign for, or pick up supplies; formulate policy or procedures; or attend meetings, staff recalls or staff functions.

The contractor will report any infractions of rules and regulations by any inmate to the COTR.

The contractor will sign a consultant log, indicating the date of visit to the institution, time of arrival, and time of departure. 

The contractor will be provided with a security and BOP procedures orientation session, consisting of approximately four (4) hours, prior to performing any services under this contact. The date and time for this orientation will be mutually agreed upon by both parties, and reimbursement for attendance may be negotiated by the contracting officer. Refresher training in security and BOP procedures may be required annually.  Compensation to the contractor for time spent in this, and any other required security related training, will be at the current year’s session rate. 

Method of Performance - The contractor has sole responsibility and discretion for choosing and implementing the manner and method of performing tasks outlined in this SOW as long as the requirements are met in accordance with the policies described above.

The services required are for a non-personal health care services type contract, as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor.  The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and/or professional aspects of services rendered (i.e., professional judgements, diagnosis for specific medical treatment).

The contractor is required to ensure that all subcontracts for provision of health care services contain the FAR clause 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance.

Invoices should be submitted in accordance with FAR 52.212-4(g) and payment will be rendered in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903).

CONTRACT PRICING - Contract pricing shall include all charges to the Government for performing the services required by this solicitation/contract (e.g., bonding, overhead, profit, supervision, minimum wages, etc.).  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  Therefore, the initial quote should contain the quoter’s best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Quoters are hereby notified that an offer of contract award shall be extended to the responsive/responsible quoter submitting the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote. 

PRICING METHODOLOGY - The quantity of services to be provided by the Contractor is estimated below and are not a representation to a quoter or contractor that the estimated quantities will be required or ordered or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Pursuant to FAR 17.203(b), the Government’s evaluation shall be inclusive of options.  Pursuant to FAR 17.203(d), the quoter may offer varying prices for options, depending on the quantities actually ordered and the dates when ordered.

<SOLNBR>W31P4Q-06-Q-0011
<RESPDATE>071506
<ARCHDATE>09132006
<CONTACT>j.michael.owens, 256-313-4178
<DESC>The US Government intends to procure services to integrate and flight test up to two (2) laser designator payloads for the Shadow TUAV for system demonstration purposes.     This integration includes two (2) Air Vehicles (AVs), one (1) Ground Control  Station (GCS), one (1) Ground Data Terminal (GDT), one (1) Portable GCS (PGCS), and one (1) Portable GDT (PGDT). Payload Specifications are as follows: Payload Size:   less than 10.3 inch diameter, With no external Electronics box and no more than a 7.5 i nch height inside the fuselage and no more than a 7.5 inch height below fuselage during take-off and landing.  Payload Weight:  less than 45 lbs.  Payload Input Voltage & Avg/Max Power:  28V; less than 300W/300W.  Command Interface:  RS-422, 19.2 baud.  Vi deo Out (switchable between EO & IR):  RS170/NTSC.  Gimbal Stabilization and laser spot stability on target:  less than 50 micro-radians;   90% laser energy on 3.5x3.5 meter target at 3.5km slant range.  Boresight Method:  Min=Pre-flight boresight verifica tion method mandatory; Desired:  in-flight operational status and boresight verification function.  EO Sensor Specifications are as follows: Sensor Type:  Color with near IR capability D/R Range (Det=1.5 cycles; Rec=4.5 cycles, 80% Pd/Pr) (DRI performance is based on 23km visibility day and 3.5m target):  greater than 7.0km.  ID Range (ID=9.75 cycles, 80% Pi):  greater than 3.25km.  IR Sensor Specifications are as follows: D/R Range (Det=1.0 cycles; Rec=3.0 cycles, 70% Pd/Pr)(DRI performance is based on a 4 .0 deg C delta T, 3.5m target):  greater than 7.0km.  ID Range (ID=8.25 cycles, 70% Pi):  greater than 3.25km.  Laser Designator Parameters are as follows: LD wavelength:  1.064 microns.   Pulse energy: greater than or equal to 70mJ/pulse.  Beam Divergence :  less than or equal to 400 micro-radians Pulse Width:  greater than or equal to 11 and less than or equal to 25 nanoseconds.  Pulse Modes:  PRF/PIM, Pulse rate programmable via the RS-422 interface with 10 bit resolution that supports pre-programmed inte rval rates, changeable via the command interface, pulse to pulse timing accuracy TBD.  Duty Cycle:  Minimum 20 percent; minimum 1.5 minutes continuous.  Laser Range Finder Parameters are as follows:  Eyesafe:  Desired.  Effective Range:  greater than 7.0km .  Accuracy +/- 5 meters.  Laser Pointer Parameters are as follows:  Wavelength:  800  900 nm, compatible with NVGs.  Power Output:  greater than or equal to 50 mW.  Beam Divergence:  less than or equal to 0.6 milli-radains. The payloads selected for integration shall be production representative prototypes that are form, fit, and functionally capable for demonstration within12 months after contract award.     The prototype payloads will be evaluated against each of the payloa d specification elements stated above as well as their ability to integrate into the Shadow 200.     The evaluation will consist of a laboratory payload characterization and a limited flight evaluation to determine the integrated payload and Shadow 200 per formance with respect to intended weapon systems.   Integration of the Laser Designator Payload into the Shadow 200 TUAV shall include coordination with the Payload vendors, software and engineering changes required for the GCS to control both prototype pa yloads, and Weight and Balance Analyses for each installation to ensure that performance/safety specifications of the Shadow 200 system and the intended weapon system(s) are not denigrated by this integration.  The System Demonstration phase shall include a flight test program with each Laser Designator Payload.     Test plans shall be in accordance with DI-NDTI-805566.     After each test phase or event, a test report shall be prepared in accordance with DI-NDTI-80809 .   A minimum of five (5) hours of fli ght testing shall be conducted on each candidate system.   Sensor performance (detection, recognition, and identification) in both EO and IR modes and laser performance (minimum laser pul se power, pulse width, beam divergence, and jitter control) will be evaluated.   Primary considerations for payload evaluations are EO/IR performance laser performance (power, stability, beam divergence, pulse width, pointing accuracy, etc.), schedule, and  cost.     The Government, upon the recommendation of the Prime Contractor, will make the final selection of the laser designator payload vendor. Once the primary vendor for the system demonstration is selected, a Live Fire Test shall be conducted with the  intended weapon system(s).    The live fire test will demonstrate the ability of the Shadow 200 system with Laser Designator Payload to successfully designate a tank size target for intended weapons system(s), resulting in at least two hits out of three f irings.     Range coordination, obtaining and providing test missiles, coordination of government lab test support, generation of Live Fire Test Plan, conduct of Test Readiness Reviews, Flight Readiness Reviews, and execution of the Test Plan shall be coor dinated between the contractor and the Joint Missile Program Office.  Integration/Flight Testing/System Demonstration is planned as sole source to AAI (CAGE 97384), producer of the Shadow TUAV under Basic Ordering Agreement W31P4Q-05-G-0004.      No later than fifteen (15) days after release of this announcement, Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact AAI Corporation, 124 Industry Lane, Hunt Valley, MD 21030, Attn:  Ms. Robin Deems, Procurement Staff Administrative Assist ant, deems@aaicorp.com, 410-628-3633 (phone), 410-628-3330 (fax).  Interested parties must be able to provide prototype payload(s) that meet the requirements within one (1) year after award.  See Note 22.
