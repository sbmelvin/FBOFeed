<p>The A-10 aircraft users have integrated the Thales Visionix, Inc. (TVI) Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment into war fighting capabilities.

<p>This effort is to procure Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment for the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The Contractor will have to develop and perform testing and evaluation in order to diagnose, repair and/or replace various parts of the HMCS equipment. The contractor will also need to provide various reports and records to help improve program sustainability,&nbsp;knowledge, and capability. Due to the proprietary nature of this requirement, the Contractor must have applied knowledge of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) Equipment</p>

Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firm(s) listed above. Specifications, plans or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.
Current qualified sources are:  Triumph Thermal Systems. (Cage: 78943), Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). 
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-8253.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III. Firm-Fixed-Price Level-of-Effort, IDIQ:  To support training, overhaul, depot-level maintenance and recapitalization of CROWS; and for general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification will consist of performance requirements and will specify technical drawings.  The detail specification will specify the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and/or how the items are to be fabricated or constructed.  Some sub-assemblies will not include technical drawings and assembly procedures.  Instead, data for those sub-assemblies will include directed source(s) or build-to-spec requirements or both. This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between multiple CROWS producers and commonality/interchangeability with the existing CROWS fleet.  The Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation but will not be included in the draft solicitation release:<br/><br/>Detail Specification<br/>   -     Performance requirements<br/>   -     Technical Drawings<br/>   -     Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/>   -     Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/>   -     Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/>   -     Assembly procedures<br/>   -     List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/>   -     Quality requirements <br/>   -     Test requirements<br/>   -     Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be provided at any time nor will Contractors have access to the data. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the US Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be handled utilizing a software change process between the US Government and Contractor(s). <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be available after Request for Proposal release upon request provided that all necessary paper work is properly completed by the requester, submitted, and approved prior to any release.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit a DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided. The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (Other Foreign) must complete and submit a AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire and a Non-Disclosure Agreement which will be provided and also be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced.  <br/><br/>This announcement serves as notification that export control procedures regulated by the ITAR are in effect on the above stated data. Contractors that are interested in receiving this data must be in compliance with the ITAR and possess the proper authorities to receive this data and are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.  The data will be marked Distribution Statement  B  Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies only.   All other requests for this data shall be referred to Project Manager Soldier Weapons.  Foreign vendors and contractors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for Contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR.  Contractors may consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and may consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions they may have relating to compliance with the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).  Please reference the following link consulting these regulations http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The Contractors responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided above.<br/><br/>After contract award, the contractors will be provided Government-Furnished Materiel (GFM) to help validate interfaces and qualify suppliers. The GFM may include full up XM153 CROWS systems, select parts and weapons. Contractors must make the appropriate accommodations to be approved for handling and storage of weapons. Government support may be provided to assist in understanding the setup and use of the XM153 CROWS and its operation following contract award. <br/><br/>The present schedule projects a release of a draft solicitation on or about 3QFY11.  An Industry Day will be announced during the draft solicitation release and further details shall be posted on FedBizOpps.gov (https://www.fbo.gov/). All responses to this notice shall be in writing in the English language and be at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government.

<a href="mailto:FLA@darpa.mil">FLA@darpa.mil</a>
<DESC>The Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program will explore non-traditional perception and autonomy methods that enable new classes of minimalistic algorithms for high-speed navigation in cluttered environments.  Through this exploration, the program will develop and demonstrate the capability for small and fast unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to fly autonomously through complex, cluttered environments.  The FLA program focuses on autonomy algorithms and softwareâ€“ specifically on sensing, perception, planning, and control â€“ rather than on the flight hardware platform.

If successful, the algorithms developed under this program could impact a wide range of unmanned systems by reducing the amount of processing power, communications, and human intervention needed for low-level tasks such as navigation through a cluttered environment.  Furthermore, small, fast, autonomous UAVs could enable missions that are not otherwise possible, such as reconnaissance in denied areas (for example, in a protected or structurally damaged building).

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists, Military Handbooks, and other standardization documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP), in Philadelphia, PA. Most documents are available in Adobe PDF format from the ASSIST database via the Internet at <a href="http://assist.daps.mil/">http://assist.daps.mil</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;Users may search for documents using the ASSIST-Quick Search and, in most cases, download the documents directly via the Internet using standard browser software.</p>
<p>Documents not available for downloading from ASSIST can be ordered from the DODSSP using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard, after establishing a DODSSP Customer Account by following the registration procedures or by phoning DODSSP Special Assistance Desk at (215) 697-6396/6257 (DSN: 442-6396/6257).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Users not having access to the Internet may contact DODSSP, Special Assistance Desk at (215) 697-6396/6257 (DSN: 442-6396/6257) or mail request to the DODSSP, Bldg. 4/D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094. Patterns, Drawings, Deviations Lists, Purchase Descriptions, etc., are not stocked at the DODSSP.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 7-8-14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Drawings/specifications will be available through the DIBBS solicitation link in the synopsis on the solicitation issue date.</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single-source procedures.

FAA intends to award a single source contract to STR-SpeechTech of Victoria, BC.

STR SpeechTech supplies StarCaster Transcribed Weather Broadcast (TWEB) and Telephone Information Briefing System (TIBS) hardware and support at three locations in Alaska. The existing StarCaster TWEB-TIBS systems located at the Juneau, Kenai and Fairbanks Alaska FSSs must be upgraded with new hardware and associated software.   The contractor must provide labor, materials, tools, training, installation, transportation, and other services needed to implement a technical refresh of the StarCaster TWEB-TIBS hardware and software.

The StarCaster TWEB-TIBS system, as originally procured from STR-Speech Tech Ltd, fully automates the conversion of transcribed (textual) weather information to audio recordings for Air Traffic operations. This item was developed by
STR SpeechTech to FAA requirements for initial installation in 2004.

STR-SpeechTech Ltd has full proprietary control over their software. No one else, either vendor or user, is authorized to modify or maintain their software and provided hardware at risk of unspecified fines or penalties. Therefore, no other vendor can provide the software support for the STARCASTER TWEB-TIBS systems.

The total estimated value is less than $300,000.00

All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Kevin O'Hara, at e-mail address kevin.o'hara@faa.gov  or mailing address FAA, AAQ530, 1601 Lind Ave SW, Renton, WA 98057. If no questions are received by Tuesday December 23, 2014 at 2pm then an anticipated award will be issued on Tuesday, December 23, 2014 at 4pm.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action and award a negotiated, Firm-Fixed Price incentive contract for an annual forest inventory data collection effort in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the Untied States. The Contractor shall provide inventory data to the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Unit. This data will be collected from predetermined forest inventory plots randomly located across New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The protocols for this effort, including the inventory plot design, are outlined and described in the "Forest Inventory and Analysis National Core Field Guide; Volume 1: Field Data Collection Procedures for Phase 2 Plots, Version 6.1 (commonly referred to as the "NRS FIA P2 Field Guide"). The current version of the "NRS FIA P2 Field Guide" serves as a reference document or instruction manual for the life of the contract and is subject to change in Option Periods 1 through 4.
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; and Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a twelve-month Base Period (from approximately March 6, 2015 to February 29, 2016); and four (4) twelve-month Option Periods from approximately March 1, 2016 to February 29, 2020 to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, falls within the competitive price range. The contract period, including the Base Period and four Option Periods (if exercised) will be from approximately March 2015 to February 2020. The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP will be the Best Value to the Government. The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. The evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance are: Factor 1 - Experience and Qualifications of Contractor and Key Personnel; Factor 2 - Past Performance; Factor 3 - Capability to Perform; and Factor 4 - Cost. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting; Factors 1, 2, and 3 are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Award of the contract will be made as a whole to the offeror whose proposal conforms to all requirements of the specifications and is the "greatest value" to the Government, cost and other factors considered.</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Meeting will be held. The date is TBD.</p>

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Raytheon Company pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of Goddard Space Flight Centers (GSFCs) Earth Observing Systems Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Evolution and Development (EED) contract (NNG10HP02C) within the Earth Sciences Division.  This procurement is to extend the effective ordering period of contract NNG10HP02C for six months, from April 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015.	The extension to the current EED contract is necessary to ensure program continuity, uninterrupted support to meet critical requirements and to avoid significant technical and schedule impacts to the contract until the follow-on competitive contract is awarded.  Sufficient time is required to finalize the follow-on contract award activities.  An increase to the current maximum ordering value of $250M is not required as the current value is considered more than sufficient to cover orders placed through the extension. <p> EOSDIS is one of the largest civilian Science Information Systems in the world.  It ingests, archives, processes and distributes an unprecedented volume of science data for NASAs flagship Earth Science missions (E.g., Terra, Aqua, Aura).  It facilitates science research by distributing science data products to millions of science users per year and supports unique requirements of a variety of Earth Science Disciplines (e.g., Land, Atmosphere, Snow/Ice, and Ocean) as well as inter-disciplinary researchers, climate modelers, and applications users (e.g., U.S. Forest Service). The scope of this contract includes the EOSDIS Core System (ECS), a high performance system for ingesting, archiving and distributing large volumes of data from numerous Earth Science instruments, as well as cross-DAAC and infrastructural components, including the Earth Data portal, The ECHO metadata repository, the Reverb search and access tool, and the User Registration System. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point contact no later than 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 21, 2015.  Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this extension action on a competitive basis.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Macrogen Corporation, 1330 Piccard Drive, Suite 205, Rockville, Maryland 20850 to procure the following for NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP):</p>
<p>Procurement:</p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement.</p>
<p>1. DNA Sequencing Service Per Reaction, Item Number: FS001, Quantity: Number of UDP Samples will be provided upon award.<br />2. DNA Sequencing service per Plate (96-Well), Item Number: FS003, Quantity Number: UDP Samples will be provided upon award.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>The NIH UDP uses an innovative paradigm for selecting patients (based upon potential for representing a new disease), for phenotyping (extensive multidisciplinary investigations at no cost to the patient), performing genetic studies (combined SNP and WES analysis using family members and filtering programs developed in house). Specific areas of interest include techniques for studying dominant inheritance and identifying families that are most likely to generate verifiable sequence variants as a result of NGS applied as an agnostic, diagnostic screen for genetic disease. Sequence variants identified by NGS are verified by Sanger sequencing following PCR amplification of the regions predicted by NGS to contain said variants. Based on the reagent, maintenance and personnel costs for in house sequencing, the UDP laboratory contracts out the Sanger sequencing of said PCR products to achieve economies of scale and maintain high quality results.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Base Year: December 2014 through June 2015<br />Option 1: June 2015 through September 2015<br />Option 2: October 2015 through September 2016</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>Macrogen Corporation has been providing sequencing service for the Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory for the past two years. Macrogen offers same day free pick up from the laboratory, a 24-hour turnaround time for results, and high quality data return. It is necessary for the Undiagnosed Disease Laboratory to retain the sequencing service provided by Macrogen in order to maintain experimental consistency and to avoid delays incurred by re- optimization of experimental design, bioinformatics testing and redesign, and restructuring the laboratory database that is already in use. The quality of the responsiveness and quality of the service that Macrogen continues to provide to NHGRI/UDP continues to be excellent.</p>
<p>Regulatory Authority:</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, with a business size standard of 500. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-79 (December 15, 2014). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;This synopsis provides notice that the Government anticipates to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services, Inc. 520 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850-6198 for 175,320 (one hundred, seventy-five thousand, three hundred and twenty) hours of Engineering and Technical Services along with associated Travel, Materials, and NMCI under solicitation, for the continuance of critical development, testing, installation and maintenance of shipboard and shore based electronic equipment to support NAWCAD 4.11.7 St. Inigoes while the competitive follow-on contract is being procured. This acquisition covers an extended period of performance of approximately 12 months that will run from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to expire on 31 March 2015. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00178-04-D-4018-M805 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 6 January 2015 1100 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any questions shall be submitted to Sharina Miller, Code 2.5.1.4.12, Fax (301) 995-1156, or via email.
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE Systems is the only source capable of providing the necessary continuation of these services without causing a break in support. It is impossible for another contractor to assume the ongoing workload without a transition period which would cause unacceptable delays in completing or continuing tasks under multiple programs for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Systems Division. Many of these efforts directly affect/support the fleet and the war fighter. In multiple cases, the contractor is a provider of certain efforts for the Navy, as original equipment manufacturers of the items have long since stopped supporting them. A break in service would adversely affect the ability to support and maintain the AN/SPN-46(V) aboard all US Aircraft Carriers. The AN/SPN-46(V) Precision Approach Landing System (PALS) is a mission essential system aboard all US Aircraft Carriers that fulfills the US Navy's requirement for an all-weather carrier landing system. Failure to perform this service will reduce the capability to safely and efficiently land aircraft aboard US Aircraft Carriers; as such, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

The applicable NAICS code is 541712 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) with a size standard of 500 employees.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be set-aside for Small Business.  The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary personnel, equipment, and services necessary to conduct the research activities delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).
Entities that provide technical support concerning the development, analysis, marketing, production, sale, utilization, and/or evaluation of various remediation processes or entities that develop, market and/or own remediation processes for evaluating hazardous waste, oil spills, or environmental contaminant remediation processes may have an actual or appearance of a Conflict of Interest.  In situations where the contractor will provide engineering and technical support to the Agency, the contractor will have first-hand knowledge of environmental remediation technologies which may include evaluations in which the contractor, an affiliate (subsidiaries, parent company, sister company, etc.) as well as current, past and potential future clients may have a commercial interest.
Entities that are directly engaged in the activities described above could have conflicts which would be difficult for the Agency to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize.  However, no entities are prohibited.  All offerors shall submit an OCOI plan that describes procedures the offeror uses to identify and report COIs. The solicitation shall include standard EPAAR provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) which require that an offeror certify whether it is aware of any potential OCOI or disclose any potential OCOI, and provide disclosure statements describing such OCOI, which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the PWS. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest that is discovered or arises after contract award shall also be part of the solicitation. Furthermore, the EPAAR clause (EPAAR 1552.20-74, Alternate V, Limitation of Future Contracting) shall also be included in the solicitation and prohibits the contractor, without the approval of the Contracting Officer, from entering into contracts with an individual, organizations, or their consul tants, to provide services on or in support of the specific remediation equipment, technology, or process identified in a work assignment.  This restriction applies during the life of the contract.
A draft PWS detailing the specific technical areas, as well as required tasks, for this FBO procurement announcement is posted as an attachment on the FedConnect? web portal. Notices of any modifications to this FBO procurement announcement, including Requests for Proposals and amendments, will be posted using the FedConnect? web portal.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Air Pollution and Prevention Control Division (APPCD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Cambustion LTD for a centrifugal particle mass analyzer.
The centrifugal particle mass analyzer, manufactured by Cambustion, Ltd., is unique because of its capability to meet the technical specifications for use in calibrating the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advanced black carbon measurement system and as an adjunct measurement with the current black carbon system to enable mass resolved aerosol measurements.  The EPA has determined that the following mass analyzer capabilities are necessary for optimal instrument calibration and measurement and ease of use with existing experimental arrangements: 1) the mass analyzer needs to support scanning by varying both speed and voltage to obtain a fixed resolution over a size distribution scan, allowing for a high resolution mass distribution measurement necessary to obtain sufficient accuracy for black carbon instrument calibration; 2) the mass analyzer needs to operate optimally at flow rates from 0.3 to 1.5 lpm to accommodate the flow rates of existing EPA equipment; 3) the mas s analyzer needs a measurement range of 0.0002 ? 1,050 fg with maintained accuracy at the smaller mass sizes for black carbon instrument calibration; and 4) the mass analyzer needs external remote control through RS-232 connection for ease of integration into existing EPA experimental arrangements.
The capabilities listed above are essential to support black carbon research at EPA. Specifically, high resolution mass classification over an extensive size range is necessary to calibrate our black carbon instrumentation for measurements of diverse combustion types, which can produce aerosols over a wide range of sizes. Additionally, the accuracy of the calibration is directly dependent on the accuracy and precision of the mass classification, necessitating a mass analyzer with optimum size resolution. Black carbon measurements of the utmost accuracy are needed to support EPA?s efforts to compare instrumentation and devise standard measurement methodology. 
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Simplified Procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit a capability statement to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Renita Tyus at the address shown above or email at tyus.renita@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

The maximum combination of orders is $75,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of Small Business contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the Small Business MATOC contract is $2,500 that applies to the base period only. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br><br>CONTRACT INFORMATION: Small Business solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <br><br>The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:<br><br> 	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach   <br><br>	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than Price (Volume 3).  <br><br>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 08/02/2012 under solicitation number W9126G-12-R-0084.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 09/13/2012.  (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

Details regarding the Conference will be provided by amendment to the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.    <br><br>MATOC:  Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated SOW.    All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.    <br><br>The total estimated contract capacity is $537,840,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive Small Businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract. <br><br>

<p>REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The 87th Contracting Squadron (87 CONS) is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential sources qualified and able to compete for a contract to perform operation and maintenance of the Dix Tertiary Wastewater Treatment Facility (TWTF) on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL). The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage at www.fbo.gov. The government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information/sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The 87 CONS intends to issue a 1 month bridge service contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, for the period 1 Jan 15 - 31 Jan 15 for the operation and maintenance of the TWTF.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 221320, Sewage Treatment Facilities. The Small Business Size Standard is $20,500,000.</p>
<p>The government requests interested parties submit a brief statement of current capability to perform these services and a letter of interest. Interested and qualified sources should provide the following information: company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, type of business and size (i.e. Small, SBA Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone), Women Owned, and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO); (2) a list of your most recent and relevant DoD and/or commercial contracts (not to exceed ten) to include a brief description, names, POCs, phone numbers, value and type of contract, and period of performance; and (3) information about your company and why you think you can perform these services.

In order to be considered in this market survey, please reply by 11:00 a.m. (EST) on 23 Dec 14.</p>
<p>Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, the 87 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns. This announcement serves as the first step for 87 CONS to determine the viability of setting aside the operation and maintenance of the TWTF for competition solely within or among certain small businesses in selected categories. This is a sources sought announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published in the FBO website at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center is exploring the state-of-the-art in technologies to measure common biomedical diagnostic parameters typically performed on blood or urine samples on space exploration missions.	 <P> For this Request for Information (RFI), NASA is seeking detailed information regarding compact technologies currently available that can analyze a biological fluid, ideally using a single device.	The specific measurements to be determined from a given biological fluid consist of six measurement panels that include blood chemistries, dissolved gases, biomolecules and cells (see table below).  The anticipated analytical system is easy to use, where the performed measurements are highly automated and derived from minimal amounts of biological sample.  Furthermore, the technology should minimize consumables and waste, where reagents and/or disposables can ultimately meet an ambient environment shelf life of 36 months.  The mass and volume restrictions shall promote a portable, stand-alone device that is soft stowed and operates in a microgravity environment.   <P> Crew Exploration Measurement Panels Panel Measurements are as follows: Basic Metabolic Panel:	Glucose, Ionized Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Total Carbon Dioxide, Chloride, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine Venous Blood Gases:  Partial Pressure Oxygen (PaO2), Partial Pressure Carbon Dioxide (PaCO2), Saturated Oxygen (SaO2), Bicarbonate (HCO3), pH Cardiac Panel:	Troponin I Hematology:  White Blood Cell Count, Red Blood Cell Count, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Neutrophils (%), Absolute Neutrophils Count, Lymphocytes (%), Monocytes (%), Eosinophils (%), Platelets Liver Panel:  Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Urinalysis:  Specific Gravity, pH, Leucocytes, Nitrites, Proteins, Glucose, Ketones, Urobilirubin, Bilirubin, Blood <P> Additional background information may be found at: <P> <A HREF="https://humanresearchwiki.jsc.nasa.gov/index.php?title=4.05">https://humanresearchw iki.jsc.nasa.gov/index.php?title=4.05 </A>     <P> Information Requested  System Description, Operation and Capabilities as follows: <P> Information is being requested on key technical aspects of a compact, biomedical diagnostics system available for analyzing a biological sample, performing space exploration specific measurements, and storing/transmitting data upon completion of analysis.  Stowage of the analyzer and peripherals is anticipated to be in the exploration medical kit, which places constraints on the mass and volume of the instrument.  In addition, information is being requested on the prospects for the technologys ability to operate in a microgravity environment. <P> 1.	Measurements Minimum diagnostic capability that provides the measurements as described above, are necessary for space exploration medicine.  Information regarding the developed and/or validated (clinical use) measurements is an indication of the maturity level of the technology.  A description and/or referencing of the instrumentation performance parameters (e.g. reference intervals, dynamic range, accuracy, precision, etc.), if available, indicates the readiness level of the technology.  Notifications for measured parameters that fall outside nominal limits that are provided by the instrument is also requested.  Additional information is requested for measurement panels under development or planned in the near future to provide insight on assay maturation timelines, and potential expansion of the technology to accommodate new assay development. 2.	Consumables and Reagents In an effort to minimize the mass, volume and stowage constraints onboard exploration vehicles, the use of consumables to provide exploration biomedical measurements is a concern.  These items include sample collection, fluid handling and sample processing (i.e. cartridges) tools. Information regarding the volume of a consumable to perform a given measurement or measurement panel is requested. A description of any liquid reagents needed to operate the system is requested as well. 3.	Power Provide a description of the power requirements of the instrument. 4.	Operability Provide a brief description on the operation of the instrument, including the need for maintenance and calibrations. 5.	Data Output and Communication Provide a description of the data output and any data storage and distribution including applicable communication standards and interfaces. 6.	Shelf Life Provide a description of shelf life and operational life, any special storage requirements of instrument or reagents and consumables. 7.	Mass and Volume Provide a description of the mass, size, and dimensions of the instrument. 8.	Microgravity The intended analytical instrument is to be operated in a space environment where gravity is no longer a major force influencing fluid flow.  Information on the prospects for instrument performance (microfluidics, in particular) in this environment is requested to determine the feasibility of the technology under microgravity conditions.  Also, the containment of fluids will be important and strategies for containment may be addressed, if the instrument does not operate a closed fluidic system. <P> The objectives of the current RFI are as follows: A.  Gather information from industry, government and academia on currently available technologies that can be used in a space clinical laboratory setting to determine the measurement panels listed above using a single device or suite of compact integrated devices. <P> B.  Gather information from industry, government and academia on the specifications and capabilities of such technologies. <P> C.  Obtain information to help guide future technology development needs and investments for the Agency. <P> For the compact instrumentation being supplied to this RFI, answers to the following specific questions are of interest to the government: 1. Which sample types currently are analyzable using the instrument? 2. Which analytes are currently analyzable using this instrument? 3. What is the minimum detection limit for each analyte? 4. What is the weight of the device? 5. What are the dimensions of the device? 6. What are the power requirements of the device? <P> Note: NASA is seeking responses regarding fully functioning devices (full integrated systems) that are currently available, developed to at least the advanced prototype stage. NASA is not seeking information about conceptual designs or individual component technologies that have not yet been integrated into a single device. <P> RESPONSES: <P> This section contains all of the information required to submit a response.

<SUBJECT>TRICARE Claims Review Services

<RESPDATE>010515
<CONTACT>Tim Evans, Senior Analyst, Email tim.evans.ctr@tma.osd.mil - Michael Sharpe, Contract Analyst, Email Michael.Sharpe.ctr@dha.mil
<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This sources sought is follow-on market research to DHA-RFI-14-TCRS. The purpose of this sources sought is to identify small businesses which have the capacity, experience, and capability, and interest to perform as the prime contractor for the TRICARE Claims Review Services (TCRS).
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. This Sources Sought is issued solely for market research only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals. Interested small businesses shall not send proposals in response to this Notice nor shall they contact any other individuals about this Notice or the requirement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The DHA's mission is to achieve greater integration of the direct and purchased health care delivery systems to accomplish the Military Health System's (MHS) Quadruple Aim: Readiness, Population Health, Experience of Care and Per Capita Cost. DHA is tasked with making military medicine stronger, better and more relevant for the future.</p>
<p>The MHS has a $50 billion budget and serves about 10.26 million beneficiaries.The MHS consists of two major care delivery systems: Direct care is provided in military treatment facilities (MTFs). Purchased care is provided by contractors including the Designated Providers (DP) under the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP), the managed care support contractors (MCSCs), the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP) contractor, the TRICARE Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), and pharmacy contractor.</p>
<p>The Improper Payment Evaluation and Transition Branch (IPE&amp;TB), under the DHA Budget &amp; Resource Management Division of the Business Support Directorate, oversees DHA's implementation, enforcement, and compliance with key provisions of the Improper payment Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) and the Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA). The IPIA/IPERA requires agencies to examine the risk of improper payments in all programs and activities by identifying and reporting improper payment findings to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for publication in the annual DoD Agency Financial Report (AFR).</p>
<p>In support of the IPE&amp;TB, the TCRS contractor will audit compliance and assess the accuracy of the claims processing for the following TRICARE purchased care contracts: the Managed Care Support Contractors (MCSCs), TRICARE Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), TRICARE Pharmacy (TPHARM) Program, TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP) and the Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP).The TCRS contractor will conduct quarterly and semiannual compliance reviews of TRICARE purchased care contractor medical, dental and pharmaceutical healthcare claims to determine contractor compliance with TRICARE policy and contract requirements, and to validate the accuracy of healthcare claims payments. DHA will use the results from the quarterly and semiannual compliance reviews to appraise the purchased care contractors' performance against TRICARE claims processing performance standards as delineated in the TRICARE Operations Manual (TOM) Chapter 1, Section 3, Paragraph 1.7 or as stipulated in the purchased care contractors' contracts. In addition, the TCRS contractor will conduct annual compliance reviews of MCSCs' reimbursement determinations for underwritten healthcare. Results from the annual compliance reviews will be used to determine the total unallowed cost for underwritten healthcare. Due to the complexity of the TRICARE benefit and the all-encompassing reviews required to comply with federal statutes, all TCRS claims reviews are done manually.</p>
<p>The TCRS requirement will include targeted reviews/focused studies, which DHA will use to validate the purchased care contractors' compliance with newly implemented TRICARE reimbursement or benefit programs. DHA will also use the TCRS targeted reviews/focused studies to support/validate potential improper payment trends identified as a result of ongoing compliance reviews or in response to analytical findings provided by other DHA entities (i.e. DHA Analytics, Program Integrity).</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS DETERMINATION: The government is considering whether to set aside the proposed contract under a small business set-aside program in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19, Small Business Programs. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The small business size standard for NAICS 541611 is $15.0 million.</p>
<p>The government is interested in all small businesses including Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone, Woman owned Small Business (WOSB) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) who are capable and interested in performing this requirement as the prime contractor. The government requests interested parties submit a description of their company's capabilities, including business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., Section 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB or SDVOSB), any anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work the prime will perform and the work to be accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.</p>
<p>Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply where at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>In order for DHA to make a small business set-aside determination, it is emphasized that small businesses provide sufficient information to indicate their capacity and capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of these services. DHA requests interested small businesses submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as stated above.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses are requested to demonstrate they have the capacity, capability (IT systems, infrastructure, staff, and facilities) and experience to perform the services listed above in the format below.</p>
<p>Small Business Sources Sought Response Format: <br />DHA will only review capability statements from small businesses.

<DESC><br />Expressions of Interest Sought Succeeding Lease - Garden County, Nebraska
<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Oshkosh, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3582 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3115 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 3/1/2015.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 24 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 4 official Government vehicles<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>Angie Drudik<br />Real Property Leasing Officer<br />Nebraska State FSA<br />7131 A Street<br />Lincoln, NE 68510<br />(402) 437-5469/Desk<br />(402) 437-5573/Fax<br />Email: angela.drudik@ne.usda.gov</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 10:00 am CST on 12/24/2014, and must include the following information:<br />&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />&bull; Date of space availability.<br />&bull; Method of rentable space measurement.<br />&bull; Building ownership information.<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />&bull; List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>Title:  Continuation of Follow-up of DES-Exposed Cohorts
<p><strong>Type of Notice:</strong></p>
<p>This is a Support Services Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential Support Services requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) research focuses on discovering genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and identifying new approaches to cancer prevention.  This project is for the re-competition of contracts HHSN261201000120C with Trustees of Dartmouth College, HHSN261201000128C with Trustees of Boston University, HHSN261201000129C with Tufts Medical Center, HHSN261201000137C with the Methodist Hospital Research Institute, and HHSN261201000145C with the University of Chicago, which were awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to continue to monitor the individuals participating in studies of DES for cancer risk, particularly among daughters as they approach menopause and among DES-exposed sons; assess the impact of and the risks associated with exposure to other hormones such as hormone replacement therapy in DES-exposed mothers and daughters; and study whether DES-exposed women and men will develop non-reproductive conditions, as required by congressional mandate under the DES Research and Education legislation.</p>
<p>The NCI, in collaboration with five field centers assembled in the early 1990s, is following cohorts of DES exposed and unexposed mothers, daughters, sons, and more recently, granddaughters. The NCI has linked this exposure to increased breast cancer risk in mothers, increased risk of 12 serious adverse outcomes, including three malignancies, in exposed daughters, and urogenital anomalies and possibly testicular cancer in sons.<br />The major objectives of the project are the following:<br />&bull;	Monitor the cancer incidence among the DES exposed daughters, sons and granddaughters compared with external and internal rates, with particular focus on cancers of the breast, uterus, ovary, prostate and colon and rectum.<br />&bull;	Monitor the mortality of mothers, daughters and sons.<br />&bull;	Monitor the incidence of validated diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, and reported diagnoses of diabetes, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension and high cholesterol comparing DES exposed with unexposed sons and daughters.<br />&bull;	Monitor the incidence of preneoplastic events (in particular, CIN2+) and the incidence of benign lesions of the breast and urogenital tract among the exposed and unexposed daughters and granddaughters. <br />&bull;	Continue to evaluate differences in reproductive experience among the granddaughters.<br />&bull;	Compare mammographic densities between DES exposed and unexposed daughters.<br />&bull;	Maintain a resource for biologic specimen collections to pursue underlying biological mechanisms for DES-related morbidities.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The project will require a contractor to continue follow-up of surviving members of an existing cohort of at least 500 women, men and their grandchildren who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero.  Disease outcomes will be ascertained by means of questionnaires, medical record review, and tissue samples as appropriate.</p>
<p>The work will include but not be limited to, mailing questionnaires to cohort members, conducting telephone interviews with study participants who did not respond to the questionnaire, validating certain outcomes reported on the questionnaire, analysis of resulting data, and development of a questionnaire for follow-up beyond the contract period. In addition, the work will include conducting searches of the National Death Index (NDI) (or providing death certificates) and relevant state cancer registries. Tracing efforts and keeping addresses up to date will occur throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be performed by the Contractor include the following:<br />1)	Conduct one questionnaire follow-up to ascertain disease outcome and risk factor information. The questionnaire will be developed under an existing contract.  Mail questionnaires to all surviving daughters and sons, and encourage the use of an online questionnaire.  The online questionnaire will be developed by a separate coordinating center identified by the Government. Conduct telephone interviews with subjects who did not complete a mailed or online questionnaire.</p>
<p>2)	Assist in development of questionnaire to be administered to third generation cohort. Conduct one questionnaire follow-up of DES-granddaughters to ascertain disease outcome and risk factor information. Contact the mothers of granddaughters who have reached 18 years of age and request consent to allow contact with them. Mail granddaughters the study questionnaire. Conduct telephone interviews with subjects who did not respond to the mailed questionnaire.</p>
<p>3) 	Continue tracing efforts of cohort members who have been lost to follow-up through the use of, but not limited to, credit bureaus, motor vehicle bureaus, town listings, web sites, previously known contact persons, and searches of the NDI and state cancer registries. Keep addresses up-to-date, within one year, for recently contacted cohort members.</p>
<p>4) 	Use quality control procedures to ensure standardization and high quality of data collection, including:<br />&bull;	Maintain a written log or record book documenting any changes affecting study conduct or analysis for DCEG, NCI informational purposes.<br />&bull;	Verify the completeness and accuracy of data sent to the coordinating center.<br />&bull;	Train study personnel to follow study procedures, and strictly supervise their work.<br />&bull;	Monitor the performance of field activities, by tracking response rates, workload, and completeness and accuracy of data collection.</p>
<p>5) 	Collect medical records and pathology reports for questionnaire reports of melanoma and cervical cancer.  Collect slides for reports of cervical disease (CIN2+).</p>
<p>6) 	Provide data from completed questionnaires and medical record validation to the coordinating center, as identified by the Government. Determine causes of death for cohort members, including mothers, who have died. Investigators shall provide identifiers to the coordinating center for centralized determination of cause of death, either through use of the NDI Plus system or through acquisition and coding of death certificates.</p>
<p>7)	Agree to the pooling of non-identified data with other participants in this effort and to be involved in analyses approved by the Steering Committee (the Steering Committee will consist of one (1) member from each Center, a representative from the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) and any consumer advocates and external advisors that provide general oversight to the study.) Meet one to two times during the year by phone with the Project Officers, other collaborators, and members of the Steering Committee to discuss analysis of pooled data and to decide upon procedures for dissemination of data after the completion of the manuscripts prepared from the pooled data.  Participate in conference calls to discuss progress on the study as needed.</p>
<p>8)    	Assist in developing a newsletter to maintain contact with the study participants and advise them of study findings. Mail two newsletters or letters to cohort members during the five-year period.  The newsletters will be formatted and printed by the coordinating center.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong><br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year options.</p>
<p><strong>Other Important Considerations:</strong><br />Only the Trustees of Dartmouth College, Trustees of Boston University, Tufts Medical Center, the Methodist Hospital Research Institute, and the University of Chicago hold the personal identifiers required for the surviving members of the existing cohorts.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought:</strong><br />We encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit a capability statement which will be considered by the agency. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following criteria:</p>
<p>1.	Documented access to this unique cohort population consisting of at least 500 women, men and their grandchildren who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. This includes holding the personal identifiers for DES cohort participants that NCI requires.</p>
<p>2.	Documented ability to obtain the necessary IRB approvals for the studies related to the DES cohort.</p>
<p>3.	Documented ability to conduct tracing efforts of cohort participants.</p>
<p>4.	Documented ability and experience in conducting cohort participant follow-up through the mailing of questionnaires, telephone interviews, and the collection of medical records.</p>

<DESC>COMMERCIAL CAPITAL ASSESSMENT PROJECTIONS (CCAP)
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide analytical and related services to provide an internal view of the General and Special Risk Insurance Fund (GI/SRI) and a small portion of the Mutual Mortgage Fund (MMI) (to be included in references to the GI/SRI fund) and assist the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to manage the risk of its portfolio of insured mortgage loans. The internal view and risk management is expected to be provided and accomplished by the contractor through a series of risk management and financial reports to be known as Commercial Capital Assessment Projections (CCAP).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Transactions associated with the FHA's guarantee programs for commercial (commercial includes multifamily apartment complexes, hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living residences, Board and Care facilities) mortgages are recorded in an account of the federal government known as the GI/SRI. FHA has insured over 45,000 million mortgages through the GI/SRI since 1970 of which over 13,000 are currently active. Aggregate insurance in force was $90 billion as of 9/30/14. Cash flows on these insurance policies result from both FHA's insurance operations and from transactions mandated by federal credit reform. Aggregate GI/SRI cash flows and performance measures are reported monthly.</p>
<p>The CCAP will have a monthly operating cycle. New input data from FHA and other appropriate sources will be updated each month or as needed for special projects principally at the direction of the Office of Management and Budget. (Information drawn from FHA is the transfer of data the contractor might need from FHA. This pertains specifically to the FHA data subject to the GI/SRI Funds for which CCAP is requesting portfolio, valuation and risk modeling. The data and frequency FHA will execute the transfers to the contractor will depend of what kind of data the contractor will need from FHA. It is anticipated these data will be transferred on a regular basis preferably monthly.) Differences between previously forecast and subsequent actual values will be evaluated for out-of -tolerance outcomes and adjustments to models will be made where appropriate. New reports and forecasts will be generated after the current accuracy and reliability of CCAP components has been established.</p>
<p>The model shall provide a sound and effective risk management to RMCAP in accordance with principles and standards such as those established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (AB-2013-07-Model-Risk-Management-Guidance) and The Federal Reserve Board and The Comptroller of the Currency (Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management). This is to also to develop, document, operate and manage the RMCAP in accordance with all applicable OMB Circulars (A-11, A-123 and A-129 (OMB Circulars)), and all applicable Federal Accounting and Audit Standards (FASAB Handbook).</p>
<p>Requirements Description<br />Performance Objectives:</p>
<p>Task Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Analyze the content of appropriate FHA information systems to identify the data elements needed to best achieve each of CCAP's objectives and work with FHA personnel and contractors to develop, implement and operate processes to transfer that information to CCAP.</p>
<p>2. Provide risk measurement and monitoring information. Intended use: accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of monthly deviations between contractual, budgeted and actual GI/SRI loan performance and the risks causing those deviations (prepayments, delinquencies, claims, losses, recoveries, etc.) by risk category, cohort, portfolio and other appropriate aggregates by: (a) calculating monthly loan level contractual and actual loan performance measures for the FHA commercial portfolios; (b) allocating the differences by type of risk expressed as dollars, as a percent of contractual or budgeted cash flows, and as conditional and cumulative performance measures rates (performance measures include default, claim, and prepayment rates).</p>
<p>3. Provide information placing risk in historical perspective. Intended use: accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the position in historical context of each monthly aggregate deviation between contractual, budgeted and actual GI/SRI cash flows by type of risk by calculating the percentile position (or other appropriate measure) of each monthly deviation to its historical distribution.</p>
<p>4. Provide property disposition information. Intended use: accurately and reliably inform FHA decision-makers of historical and probable future note and property-level net proceeds by probability (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) and method of disposition.</p>
<p>5. Provide probable future cash flows from outstanding insurance-in-force. Intended use: for outstanding endorsements on a monthly basis: reliably and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of future monthly undiscounted cash flows by probability (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) for each cohort and other appropriate aggregate by line item on the cash activity report taking into analytic account probable future economic environments and the probable loan-level deviations from contractual cash flows expected to result from those environments.</p>
<p>6. Estimate the performance of the loan risk categories, cohorts and portfolios used to generate the guaranty liability. Intended use: as a component of FHA's financial statements as of each October 31st. FHA's loan guaranty liability is part of its annual financial statements which are targeted for completion at or soon after mid-November.</p>
<p>7. Provide probable future risk category, cohort, portfolio insurance-in-force cash flows (beginning with the cash flows provided by the Cash Flow Team) and performance measures. Intended use: on a monthly basis for the next seven risk categories, cohorts, portfolios: reliably and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of predicted insurance-in-force and monthly undiscounted cash flows and performance measures by probability (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) by taking into analytic account probable future economic environments and the probable loan-level deviations from contractual cash flows expected to result from those environments.</p>
<p>8. Provide capital ratio monitoring. Intended use: on a monthly basis, accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of (a) the level and trend of compliance with the GI/SRI's target capital ratio and (b) the probable future compliance with the GI/SRI's target capital ratio by: calculating capital ratios for the commercial risk categories, cohorts, portfolios, individually and collectively, and for the GI/SRI fund by dividing the valuations provided by the cash flow team the Cash Flow Team by the corresponding values of insurance-in-force.</p>
<p>9. Provide menu-driven policy analyses. Intended use: (a) on a monthly basis, accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the levels and trends of selected performance indicators (credit subsidy rate, delinquency rate, claim rate, loss rate, firm commitment volume, endorsement volume etc.) over the appropriate ranges of historical underwriting criteria, servicers, servicing and property disposition practices and cross-tabulations thereof by risk category, cohort, portfolio, program and other appropriate aggregates; and, (b) accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the impacts of changes in selected historical loan performance indicators (credit subsidy rate, delinquency rate, claim rate, loss rate, firm commitment volume, endorsement volume etc.) that would have resulted from changes in the historical ranges of selected underwriting criteria, servicers, servicing and property disposition practices and cross-tabulations thereof by risk category, cohort, portfolio and other appropriate aggregates.</p>
<p>10. Provide policy analyses requiring new or extended methods, models and/or estimation. Intended use: (a) as needed, provide expert analytic services to adapt the CCAP software to accurately and appropriately inform FHA decision-makers of the probable impacts (1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99%) of adopting new underwriting criteria, Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) changes, servicing, eligibility requirements, loan size criteria, new program specifications or other proposed program changes and property disposition practices on selected performance indicators (credit subsidy rate, delinquency rate, claim rate, refinance rate, loss rate, firm commitment volume, endorsement volume etc.) including cross-tabulations of new and existing criteria and practices by risk category, cohort, portfolio and other appropriate aggregates; (b) compare the projected performance to the pre-change historical performance; (c) where appropriate, add the analyses to the array of menu-driven policy analyses such that they can be rerun and downloaded after updating inputs but without additional contract labor effort.</p>
<p>11. Provide information for annual report. Intended use: (a) annually, using results generated by achieving Objective 7 as of October 31st, summarize the level and trend of GI/SRI valuations and the GI/SRI capital ratio together with probable future valuations and capital ratios for the next seven fiscal years in one or more formats appropriate to FHA's Report to Congress; and, (b) provide expert analytic services to summarize and explain the data and trends, the general risks to the forecast and the specific risks to the GI/SRI valuations and capital ratios. FHA generally completes its Report to Congress between mid-November and mid-December of each year.</p>
<p>12. Provide budget performance estimates and re-estimates. Intended use: enhance FHA's ability to effectively and efficiently achieve GI/SRI policy goals at minimal risk to taxpayers and to comply with GI/SRI capital ratio requirements by: (a) adapting information and models produced to achieve Objectives 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 to accurately and reliably estimate probable credit subsidy rates and probable firm commitment and endorsement volumes for budget risk category, cohort, portfolios and corresponding re-estimates for outstanding risk category, cohort, portfolios and inform FHA decision-makers of their probable impacts on GI/SRI capital resources and the need for mandatory appropriations; (b) estimate the probable performance measures rates which correspond to probable credit subsidy rates; (c) estimate the probable impacts of the prescribed economic assumptions on probable GI/SRI performance measures and other key variables and, as needed, provide analytic support for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of deviations from prescribed budget practices; and, (d) provide all budgetary materials in the formats prescribed by the OMB.</p>
<p>13. Provide report storage and retrieval. Intended use: each report and similar output and its supporting data will be organized by the contractor for electronic storage with efficient, user friendly query and retrieval capabilities.</p>
<p>14. Provide reports and inquiry capability currently available in the OPIIS (Online Property Integrated Information Suite) model and tool. Intended Use: To provide HUD/Housing available information reports on commercial property risk assessment for HUD Headquarters and the HUD Field Offices. Currently OPIIS does not contain reports for the 232 and 242 programs. The Base Year will include adding reports for the 232 and 242 programs reports and modifying reports. Currently the OPPIS model contains approximately 50 reports and online views consisting of commercial property FHA-insured loans consisting of insured loan portfolio data such as insurance-n-force, location, units, number of buildings, financial statements, vacancy rates, risk assessment of default, etc.<br /><br />15. CCAP must provide the similar services offered in OPIIS:<br />a. Provide access to approximately 2,000 HUD/Housing/FHA users nationwide including US Territories;</p>
<p>b. Help Desk with phone number and email for questions from field and HUD Headquarters;</p>
<p>c. In addition to the existing reports in OPIIS being replicated in the Base Year, up to 12 new reports will be developed in CCAP;</p>
<p>d. Business and model support on HUD at work website including updated DED updates, training, etc.;</p>
<p>e. Provide full day to day operation and maintenance;</p>
<p>f. New tool development or enhancement similar to develop of Property Review Template tool on an as-needed basis. The model changes are more service-provider driven than HUD driven and therefore the service provider must update changes on mutually agreed upon timeframes;</p>
<p>g. Model and Tool documentation;</p>
<p>h. Model and Tool user support hours will be provided each year and in what format,</p>
<p>i. Fully document, test, and implement any new data additions and changes to models, tools and database(s). Contractor will be responsible for new script development to support model, tool and database changes and additions;</p>
<p>j. Ad-hoc data requests - up to 12 per month - be handled for data requests from Sr. Management, program areas, Capitol Hill, etc.;</p>
<p><br />Technical objectives:</p>
<p>1. Simplicity: to help manage operational risk, each CCAP task objective must be achieved by the simplest methods available for the required accuracy and reliability. The processes by which the CCAP produces information to inform FHA decision-makers must be comprehensible by mortgage insurance practitioners.</p>
<p>2. Efficiency: to ensure maximum timeliness of the information produced by CCAP and to help ensure that project and budget development deadlines are met, the total elapsed time between the availability of required inputs to CCAP and the availability of decision-ready reports must be minimized without degrading the reliability, precision or other qualitative aspects of the information.</p>
<p>3. Model risk management: each CCAP task objective must be achieved within a provided framework effectively designed to manage model risk to within tolerable levels.</p>
<p>4. Transparency: each component of the CCAP must be adequately documented so as to: (1) prevent key person or contractor dependency; (2) enable proper operation; (3) facilitate independent review with minimal assistance; and, (4) reduce risk when report or model is changed.</p>
<p>5. Credibility: all information produced by each CCAP component must be authoritatively credible as evidenced by professional acceptance as best practices of the methods used to produce the information and the recognized expertise of the subject matter expert in the fields of financial analysis and modeling, financial risk management, mortgage analytics and mortgage insurance and as required by FHA, OMB or other governmental standards.</p>
<p>6. Inputs: all risk measurement and model assumptions and data must be appropriate, accurate and complete.</p>
<p>7. Processes: all processes must be conceptually valid, logically consistent and conform to then current best practices; all code must be verified to the corresponding theory and mathematics.</p>
<p>8. Outputs: all information generated by the CCAP must include a brief, thorough and comprehensible assessment of its accuracy and reliability. Such assessments will include monthly comparisons of predicted and actual outcomes to ensure that differences remain within tolerances.</p>
<p>9. Loan guaranty liability: all inputs, processes and estimates of loan guaranty liability must conform to all accounting and audit standards and other authoritative pronouncements applicable to FHA and conform to concepts and guidance provided by the OMB.</p>
<p>Program Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Ownership: FHA must own and be in a format acceptable to HUD, effective ownership and possession, such as through a custodian, of all versions of the CCAP processes, models, reports, data and related documentation at the end of each business day and the end of the contract term. Required to host the models, tools and data in a secure location acceptable to FHA.</p>

Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate responders for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response.</p>
<p>The Department of State operates over 270 facilities worldwide. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are used at these facilities to provide reliable power for security and safety systems.</p>
<p>This RFI solicits industry input on available single-phase and three-phase commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) UPS systems that are compatible with non-US electrical grids. The UPS systems of interest range in capacity from 3 kVA to 30 kVA and have a minimum full load run time of 15 minutes. Various statuses and alarms are also required, along with the capability to safely remove, repair, and reinstall the system without disrupting power to the security and safety systems. Interest is also expressed in 3 to 30 kVA COTS UPS systems with extended run times of one hour at full load. These systems should utilize non-proprietary, standard replacement batteries that are available in most regions of the world.</p>
<p>UPS requirements are discussed in more detail in Section 4.0: Requirements.</p>
<p>Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>DS is the law enforcement and security arm of the U.S. Department of State. DS is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. All Foreign Service posts (embassies, consulates-general, consulates, et al.) operate with technical and physical security programs designed and maintained by DS. In general terms, DS is responsible for direct, recurring support for physical and technical security programs at some 270 overseas Foreign Service posts. ST has the key role in ensuring that overseas technical and physical security systems are installed, maintained, repaired, upgraded, and monitored.</p>
<p>In support of these responsibilities, DS utilizes uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to provide constant, clean, stable, and reliable power for security and safety systems. DS, specifically the Technology Development Branch (TDB), evaluates new technology for ST. TDB is seeking COTS products for this application. While potential vendors may suggest an item that is a modification of an existing product, the requirement of any future procurement will be a COTS product that is available for sale to the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government contractor or sub-contractor, in single-piece quantities.</p>
<p><strong>3.0	Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>At this time, there is no requirement for a facility security clearance or cleared staff under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). However, if a respondent participates in the NISP and has facility and personnel clearances, that information should be provided in the response. The company must have a robust technical support group to support user, installation and repair documentation; technical and software updates/revisions; and training, as may be needed by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Requirements<br /><br />4.1 General Requirements</strong><br />DS is interested in exploring single-phase and three-phase UPS solutions that can be installed inside electrical rooms. These units must fit through a standard 36-inch doorway.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Power</strong><br />The UPS system should:<br />i.	Have single-phase input/output power for single-phase units, and have three-phase input/output power for three-phase units.<br />ii.	Accept worldwide input voltages (such as 100V, 120V, 220V, 230V and 240V for single-phase units, and 208V/120V, 240V/120V, 380V/208V, 400V/220V and 415V/240V input voltage for three-phase units).<br />a.	DS will accept either a single model rated for all input voltages, or multiple models that are each designed for a specific voltage. <br />b.	Nominal output voltage shall be equal to the nominal input voltage. <br />iii.	Accept 50 Hz and/or 60 Hz. <br />a.	DS will accept either a single model rated for all input frequencies, or multiple models that are each designed for a specific frequency. <br />b.	Nominal output frequency shall be equal to the nominal input frequency. <br />iv.	Have scalable models that nominally range from 3 kVA up to at least 15 kVA for single-phase units, and up to 30 kVA for three-phase units. DS recognizes that UPS sizing varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Operation<br /></strong><br />The UPS system will require the following operating characteristics:<br />i.	An external make-before-break (MBB) bypass/transfer switch.<br />a.	The bypass/transfer switch should be rated for the applied voltages, currents, and AC configuration.<br />ii.	The UPS backup time should be scalable, as follows:<br />a.	Base System: 15 minutes (minimum) at full load at 25C/77F. <br />b.	Extended Runtime System: 60 minutes (minimum) at full load at 25C/77F. <br />iii.	Uses a long-life battery technology that requires minimal maintenance<br />iv.	Uses COTS components, which can be individually replaced.<br />v.	Is compatible with grounded neutral as well as floating neutral power sources; an isolation transformer may be used.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Modes of Operation</strong></p>
<p>i.	Normal: Provides output power to the load for all line and load conditions within the specified range of operation.<br />ii.	Backup: When input power falls outside the specified range of operation, the UPS continues to provide output power to the load, deriving energy from the backup system, with no detectable interruption in power to the load. When input power is restored, there will be no detectable interruption in power to the load.<br />iii.	Bypass Modes:<br />a.	Automatic/Static Bypass: In the event of a load fault or internal UPS failure, the UPS performs an automatic transfer from the inverter to the input/bypass power source. There is no detectable interruption in power to the load during these transfer events.<br />b.	External Maintenance Bypass: An external bypass switch designed to work with the UPS is needed to allow for manual control of the system's power flow. The bypass switch shall offer at least three modes of operation: LINE, UPS, and SERVICE. The external maintenance bypass switch allows for the safe and complete removal and replacement of the UPS unit, without loss of power to the load.</p>
<p><strong>Mode	Description<br /></strong><br />LINE	Load is connected directly to input power and disconnected from UPS output.<br />UPS	Load is connected directly to UPS output and disconnected from input power.<br />SERVICE	Load is connected directly to input power and disconnected from UPS output. UPS is disconnected from input power. UPS maintenance or repair can be performed in this mode.</p>
<p>c.	The modes may have names that differ from those listed, but they should provide the functions described. There should be no detectable interruption in power to the load during these transfer events. The bypass switch should be available for purchase either as a package with the UPS or as a separately orderable item.</p>
<p><strong>4.5 Statuses and Alarms</strong></p>
<p>i.	A built-in health monitoring system is needed to provide system status and alarms.  Required items are:<br />a.	Input/output voltage, frequency, current<br />b.	Output power<br />c.	Overload alarm<br />d.	Backup time<br />e.	Low runtime alarm<br />f.	Utility power failure alarm<br />g.	Peak measured load (or peak-hold measurement)<br />h.	UPS on battery power<br />i.

These set dressing will enhance and upgrade existing and future USMC Military Operation in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Home Station Training (HST) areas and Ranges. Currently, the existing MOUT and planned HST area facilities and surrounding Range areas are void of cultural realism. Even though these areas are equipped with streets, courtyard walls, buildings, and village shanties, the atmosphere is void of detailed cultural realism such as "prop" like items (furniture, billboards, faux foodstuffs, ersatz crops, colors and mud brick facades etc.) utilized during training scenarios. Generally, MOUT and HST buildings and walls have similar facades and lack the real world exteriors, interiors, and surrounding areas representative of realistic foreign urban areas needed for vital and realistic mission rehearsals. This project is designed to simulate a future or current deployable urban environment and support the war fighting skills and improve training opportunities for Marines, tenants, and joint service units aboard USMC training areas.

Delivery/Placement: This allows for delivery and placement of complete sets within the training environment to support the training requirements.<br />c. Logistics and Data: These efforts include all aspect of life cycle product support. <br />d. Contract Management: This effort also includes delivery of timely information and data in order to manage the contract. <br />The contractor shall provide multiple sets. The contractor shall adhere to the Atmospherics Performance Specification. The contractor shall provide a set designed for a standard unit of measure (UOM), which is essentially one (1) room/space. There is no requirement for lavatory facilities in the following set designs. The contractor shall provide a set that includes: <br />a. A set that incorporates indigenous items that replicate an area of operations as designated with each delivery order with emphasis on training objectives.<br />This is a general description of the effort and its locations, and is not all-inclusive. The point of contact for this acquisition is: Ms. Janet Fondriest, Contract Specialist, at janet.fondriest@usmc.mil.<br />Any questions about the draft solicitation documents are due in writing to janet.fondriest@usmc.mil by 12:00 hours local time, 23 JAN 2015.

1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

3.3 The VA is seeking insight to the procurement strategy of the needed images:

<CONTACT>Leslie A. Sayre
<DESC>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.203.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).
The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office (GFO) anticipates the issuance of a solicitation under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The U.S. Department of Energy?s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is commissioning impact and process evaluations for two national laboratory pilots aimed at supporting EERE?s national mission of producing high-impact research, development, and demonstration to make clean energy as affordable and convenient and breaking down barriers to market entry.  This solicitation will result in a firm-fixed price (FFP) service type contract to engage the services of a contractor to conduct a rigorous evaluation of these pilots.
The two laboratory pilots are: (1) Small Business Vouchers Pilot ? This pilot aims to, (a) Leverage national laboratory capabilities for economic development by establishing a laboratory voucher program for small business (b) Provide access to expertise, competencies, and equipment at all DOE national laboratories 
(2) Lab-Corps Pilot ? Announcements of this pilot are found at: (a) http://energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-lab-program-accelerate-commercialization-clean-energy (b) http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/29/empowering-entrepreneurial-labs-new-lab-corps-program-accelerates-energy-technologie
The purpose of the evaluation is to develop independent, quantitative estimates of the impacts as well as capture implementation lessons learned and make recommendations to DOE on ways to further improve the Lab-Corps and Small Business Vouchers investments if DOE wishes to scale up the investment after the pilot has ended.  Refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 draft Statements of Work (SOW) for each of the pilots.
The pilots (Phase 1 and Phase 2) are expected to be completed within 61 months after the start of the project (assuming Phase 2 will be required).  The estimated total magnitude for Phase 1 and Phase 2 is $550,000.00.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618 with a size standard of $15.0.  This requirement is not being set-aside for any small business concerns.
DOE anticipates issuing a RFQ to award a contract to perform both impact and process evaluation of the two national laboratory pilots on or about January 5, 2015.  The awardee will be expected to start up the project in early February.  The RFQ will be posted on FedConnect (www.Fedconnect.net) and FedBizOps (www.fbo.gov).   Copies of the RFQ will only be available on these systems.  All future information about this RFQ, including any amendments, will also be available through FedConnect and FedBizOps.  Interested parties are responsible for continuously monitoring these websites to ensure that they have the most recent information about this proposed contract action.  The anticipated award date for this contract is February 9, 2015.

<CONTACT>Darcy J Rapoza, Phone 541-750-7116, Fax 541-750-7236, Email djrapoza@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The US Forest Service, Pacific Northwest (PNW) Research Station, intends to issue a sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for software upgrade to the EMDS System to Mountain View Business Group, LLC, Upland, CA.&nbsp;EMDS is a spatially enabled decision support technology for environmental analysis and planning that runs as a component of the ArcGIS 10.x geographic information system (GIS) platform. EMDS itself is made up of a collection of proprietary components, including a logic engine (from Rules of Thumb, Inc.), a decision engine (from InfoHarvest, Inc.), and the EMDS Core (under the management of Mountain View Business Group, LLC). The companies and the USFS collectively manage the EMDS Consortium, which oversees maintenance and development of the EMDS system. This IDIQ contract covers the design and implementation of the next three versions of EMDS (versions 5, 6, and 7).
<p>Major system enhancements to the EMDS Core over the next three versions of the system include:<br />1. Code optimization and support for parallel processing, resulting in 10- to 100-fold speed increase in computationally intensive processes.<br />2. Re-engineering of database management components to increase record handling from a current limit of about 15,000 features (spatial records) to approximately 1,000,000 features. Support for SDE and other commonly used corporate spatial data platforms are also part of this enhancement.<br />3. Implementation of provenance tracking. All user interactions with the system are tracked. Provenance tracking provides complete documentation of all analytical steps, assuring that highly complex analyses can be faithfully reproduced at a later time or by third parties. Provenance tracking also enables users to roll back any desired number of steps in a complex analytical process and pivot to new pathways.<br />4. Implementation of a workflow interface. At version 5.0, EMDS itself will be fully re-architected as workflows, using the Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF, open source from Microsoft Research). Workflow management will be implemented in Trident (an open source third party user interface to the WWF implemented by NOAA and collaborators). With the workflow interface, system users will be able to 1) customize EMDS process steps, 2) more easily introduce new plug-in components (e.g., other engines such as a prolog engine or Bayesian network engine) to extend the functionality of the base system, and 3) highly automate pre- and post-processing GIS operations which are otherwise often a major bottleneck to complex spatial analyses.<br />5. Somewhat later in the overall development plan, implementation of an enterprise version that will enable many EMDS components to run as web services, including delivery of a web interface to EMDS products produced in its standard desktop environment.</p>
<p>Design and implementation of the EMDS Core was performed by the Redlands Institute (University of Redlands, Redlands, CA) from 2005 to mid-2014 as a member of the EMDS Consortium. The Institute closed in June 2014, and responsibility for design and implementation of the EMDS Core was transferred to the Mountain View Business Group because its senior software engineer had been the senior EMDS system software engineer overseeing EMDS development for the Redlands Institute. A very high level of software engineering expertise is needed to support the design and implementation of the EMDS Core because the Core is an integrating component for three other software systems, each of which is highly complex in its own right. Moreover, the knowledge to manage the Core design is extremely specific to the collection of systems and components that make up EMDS. Over the course of four generations of EMDS development, the project manager (Dr. Keith M Reynolds, PNW Research Station) estimates that software engineers typically require 6-12 months of experience with the system environment before they have enough proficiency to design efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>This action is taken pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>

<DESC>USPTO is responsible for granting US intellectual property rights for patents and trademarks. As a patent application enters the pre-examination, examination, and post-examination cycles, the Patent Examiners (PE) and the Technical Support Staff (TSS) perform a variety of tasks on the application. The USPTO, Office of Patent Quality Assurance (OPQA) currently uses a Quality Review System (QRS) application that allows quality assurance reviewers to review the work done by the PE and TSS throughout the examination cycle. The USPTO is conducting market research to determine the feasibility and availability of a new QRS.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Patient Satisfaction and Nursing Quality Measurement Services
Washington DC VA Medical Center
B.1.1 Scope

This project consists of contracting for a complete satisfaction survey (inpatient, emergency care, primary and specialty care, ambulatory surgery, outpatient mental health and the CLC) consisting of generally
accepted methodologies to determine, through targeted questions, Washington DC VA Medical Center beneficiary opinions as related to their inpatient admissions and outpatient experience. The Contractor shall be required to execute all duties related to developing the survey, printing, mailing and sampling of patients as well as data analysis, benchmarking, and report generation to the medical center. Patients will have the option of replying by mail and internet.  The project shall also involve the use of a web-based reporting system that allows the Washington DC VAMC to report nursing quality measures, compare analyzed results to national benchmarks and participate in an annual nursing survey.

Questions and methods of analysis shall be care setting specific and targeted to the requested populations.
The service shall consist of the development of a survey instrument that includes customized questions
specific to, and as directed by the Washington DC VA Medical Center, as well as questions that permit comparison to other VA and non-VA facilities (the Medical Center's primary research goal is to clarify the data provided from the Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients conducted by the VA National Performance Data Feedback Center (NPDFC). The surveys shall encompass patients discharged from the following areas/Units: Medical ICU, Surgical ICU, 3DE Psych (Inpatient Psychiatry), 2D Surg (General Surgery), 2D Neuro (Neuro Surgery),4E Med (Medical and Telemetry), 3E Med (Medical and Oncology), and CLC (Long-term, Palliative Care, Rehab, and Hospice); and ambulatory patients (ED, Primary & Specialty Care, Ambulatory Surgery, Outpatient Mental Health). Veterans who have been admitted to or encountered one of the above listed areas within the contract term of the project will be included in the survey. In addition, the Contractor shall be expected to use quantitative and qualitative data analyses in accomplishing the assigned task.

Nursing quality measures will allow the facility to report on indicators related to staff skill mix, hours per patient day, turnover, education and certification, psychiatric patient assault rate, patient falls, patient falls with injury, hospital acquired pressure ulcer prevalence, restraint prevalence, hospital associated infections (ventilator associated pneumonia/event, central line associated blood stream infection, catheter associated urinary tract infection) and RN job satisfaction and practice environment scales.

The Contractor shall be required to make an initial site visit immediately following award of the contract at a time convenient for both the Contractor and the Government. A site visit after the initial survey results shall be required (after the first quarter). The Contractor shall perform a minimum of an annual site visit to the Washington DC VA Medical Center to review the collected data and results to authorized Medical Center staff members and provide unlimited telephone support to authorized Medical Center staff members.

The Contractor shall:  

"	Design Washington DC VA Medical Center specific coding for data analysis purposes.
"	Make the survey tool available in Spanish.

receipt of the required discharge information from the Washington DC VA Medical Center.
"	Mail the survey to all patients who completed ambulatory care appointments within seven (7) days of receipt of the required encounter information from the Washington DC VA Medical Center.

The Contractor shall recommend an appropriate sample size of discharged and ambulatory patients to the Washington DC VA Medical Center who will then determine the specific number of patients to obtain information. If the agreed upon sampling strategy does not produce enough data, a higher sampling rate may need to be implemented.
The Washington DC VA Medical Center and the Contractor shall develop a means of transferring patient data that is acceptable to both parties. The Washington DC VA Medical Center will send information to the Contractor weekly via a Secure Transfer Protocol.

B.1.2 Security Requirements

All patient information provided to the Contractor shall be safeguarded under the terms of the Privacy Act of 1974 and/or any future implications of HIPAA (See Attachment A).

The Contractor shall de-identify protected information as soon as it is no longer necessary for the survey process. The Contractor shall, with access to Washington DC VA Medical Center transmitted patient information, shall be required to complete annual Veterans Health Administrative training titled VHA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior and Privacy and HIPAA Training. Certificates documenting the training shall be provided to the Washington DC VAMC upon request.

The level of background investigation commensurate with the level of access needed to perform the Statement of Work (SOW) is low risk. This requirement is applicable to all Contractor personnel requiring the same access.  (See Attachment A-6500)

The Contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations. If the investigation is conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) through the VA, the Contractor shall reimburse the VA within thirty (30) days.

Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services.

Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>ii. Volume Two -- Past Performance Information (PPI) (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). Submit information from recent contracts performed within the last three (3) years, which are considered relevant in demonstrating ability to perform local exchange services involving similar scope, magnitude of effort, and complexities as the services described in this solicitation. Include the following administrative data for each referenced contract submitted: Offeror's company name; contracting agency; contract number; brief description of contract; contract type (i.e., fixed price, time and material, etc.); period of performance, identification of any significant achievements or past problems and resolution; and name, address, telephone number, and email address of program manager and Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages).</p>
<p>A. Contracting Information. <br />(1) Provide the signature block of the individual authorized to make an offer which includes individual's name, title, e-mail address and phone number. <br />(2) Provide cage code, data universal numbering system (DUNS) number, and tax identification number as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). <br />(3) Organizational Representatives.

List shall reflect both contracting and technical representatives for help desk issues and troubleshooting.<br />(4) Evidence of Certification. Certification shall be IAW Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS estimates. <br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p><strong>Government Evaluation:<br /></strong>The Government will award a contract to the <em>lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror</em> whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Capability:</span> In order to be considered technically capable offerors must make clear their capability to meet the requirements in the statement of work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of capability to maintain and repair fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, pre-reaction systems, or fire extinguishers will make the offer technically unacceptable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Lack of experience with Siemens fire products will make the offer technically unacceptable and ineligible for award. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A lack of demonstrated ability to meet the required 2 hour emergency response time will make the offeror technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span> The Government will verify the offeror demonstrated minimum 3 years' experience in maintaining fire protection systems of a similar size (or larger) than those contemplated under this combined synopsis/soliciation. DMEA will contact offerors previous customers to verify how successful the offeror's firm was in servicing the identified fire protection systems under those contracts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of experience with comparable projects will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Unsatisfactory performance on previous contracts will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span> Quotes will be evaluated to ensure that all labor rates proposed are consistent with industry practices and historical prices paid by the Government for similar services. The Government will verify that the number of hours proposed for completing preventative maintenance work is consistent with industry practices and the Government's experience on similar work.</p>
<p><strong>Representations and Certifications: </strong>To be eligible for contract award, vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM): <a href="http://www.SAM.gov">www.SAM.gov</a>. If not registered at this time, vendors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their quote. If a prospective successful offeror cannot become registered by two (2) weeks after the date proposals are due, their quote will be considered non-responsive and award will be made to the next lowest-priced technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Because DMEA is a secure facility, DMEA staff will escort all maintenance workers around the facility and during performance. Upon completion, the COR will inspect all work to ensure all maintenance was performed, all necessary repairs were made, and that the system is functioning properly. When remedial emergency maintenance is required, DMEA will contact the contractor to schedule the repair work. If the Government determines that the cause of any needed repairs is the fault of the contractor, the repairs shall be made at no cost to the Government.</p>

Firms who appear on the List will be eliminated without further consideration.	 <p> Firms will also be checked against the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administrations data base for safety citations/violations.  Reports of significant safety citations or violations will be referred to the KSC Safety Office for further review. <p> In accordance with FAR Clause 52.204-7, a Firm submitting a response to this synopsis acknowledges that a prospective contractor shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this synopsis. Firms will be checked against the SAM database. <p> Responses will also be checked for minor informalities or irregularities.  <p> NEGOTIATIONS <p> In accordance with FAR 36.602-3, discussions will be held with at least three of the most highly qualified A-E Firms and the final selection decision will be by the designated Selection Authority.  The final selection shall be a listing, in order of preference, of the Firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work and will authorize the Contracting Officer to begin negotiations with the selected Firms. Selected Firms will be required to submit Forward Pricing Rate Proposals and Small Business Subcontracting Plans (applicable to large businesses only). The two documents shall NOT be submitted with original responses.  These two documents will be due within 14 calendar days from the date requested by the Contracting Officer. <p> If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the Contracting Officer shall obtain a written final proposal revision from the Firm, and notify the Firm that negotiations have been terminated. The Contracting Officer shall then initiate negotiations with the next Firm on the final selection list. This procedure shall be continued until a mutually satisfactory contract has been negotiated. <p> FORWARD PRICING RATE AGREEMENTS (FPRAs) <p> For the purpose of simplifying and increasing efficiency in the negotiation and execution of Task Orders under the IDIQ contracts, A-E teams selected, by the Selection Authority, as the most highly qualified to perform the work, shall submit FPRA proposals. The FPRA proposals shall include, but are not limited to, a description of direct labor categories, direct labor rates, annual escalation of rates, G&A rates, overhead rates, Computer Assisted Design rates, and other recurring costs.  The FPRA proposals will be negotiated and incorporated into the resultant IDIQ contract. A-E teams failing to negotiate acceptable FPRAs with the Contracting Officer will be ineligible for award. <p> SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLANS <p> NASA is committed to providing woman-owned small business concerns, economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities/minority institutions, maximum practicable opportunities to participate in Agency acquisitions at the prime contract level.  The participation of NASA prime contractors in providing subcontracting opportunities to such entities is also an essential part of the Agencys commitment.  <p> In accordance with FAR 52.219-9, ALT 2, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in order to be eligible for award, large businesses shall, upon the Contracting Officers request, submit and negotiate acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plans. Small Business Subcontracting Plans are only required from large businesses selected, by the Selection Authority, as the most highly qualified to perform the work.  <p> The Contracting Officer has determined small business subcontracting possibilities exist and has established an overall IDIQ small business subcontracting goal of 8%. The Contracting Officers assessment of appropriate subcontracting goals for this acquisition, expressed as a percentage of total contract value ($10M for each contract), is provided in the chart below. The small business subcontracting goals are for Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI). <p> SMALL BUSINESS CATEGORY SUBCONTRACTING GOAL SDB	0.86% HUBZone 	0.29% SDVOSB	0.90% VOSB	1.88% WOSB	2.90% EDWOSB	1.18% HBCU/MI 0.00% <p> The numbers above reflect the Contracting Officers assessment of the appropriate subcontracting goals to be achieved at the completion of contract performance.	Large businesses selected as the most highly qualified to perform the work, must perform an independent assessment of the small business subcontracting opportunities and are encouraged to propose goals that are equivalent to or greater than those recommended by the Contracting Officer in their Small Business Subcontracting Plans. Small Business Subcontracting Plans shall discuss the rationale for any goal proposed that is less than the Contracting Officers recommended goal in any category and describe the efforts made to establish a goal for that category and what ongoing efforts, if any, are planned during contract performance to increase participation in that category.  <p> Selected large businesses failing to negotiate acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plans with the Contracting Officer will be ineligible for award. <p> SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PLANS <p> A-E contractors shall take all reasonable safety and occupational health measures when performing work under KSC contracts. A-E contractors shall comply with all Federal, State, and local laws applicable to safety and occupational health and with the safety and occupational health standards, specifications, reporting requirements, and other relevant requirements of the awarded contracts.  Notification is hereby provided that A-E contractors awarded KSC A-E contracts will be required to submit written Safety and Occupational Health Plans after contract award.  The plans, as approved by the Contracting Officer, will be incorporated into the contracts. <p> QUESTIONS/COMMENTS <p> Questions or comments regarding this synopsis must be submitted in writing, citing the synopsis number, and be directed via email to the Contracting Officer: Sharon White at <a href="mailto:Sharon.L.White@nasa.gov">Sharon.L.White@nasa.gov </a> .  Telephone questions will NOT be accepted.  Questions shall be submitted on or before 2:00 pm EDT on January 09, 2015.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>

<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.</p>
<p>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
The solicitation number is P14PS00232, and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation. 
The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-79 effective Dec. 15, 2014.  It is the contractorÂ¿s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  Clauses and provisions can be found at http://www.acquisition.gov/far. 
The NAICS code is 522130 and 522110 with an associated small business size standard of $550 million in assets.  This solicitation is a 100% total small business set-aside, and will result in a firm fixed price contract to a single vendor determined to be responsive and responsible. The Government will consider SAM registration in determining responsibility.  

DESCRIPTION:  The National Park Service (NPS), Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area (LARO), has a requirement for a vendor to process fee collection in accordance with the following tasks:  

(A)	National Park Service delivers sealed bank bags to the contractor once a week.  The contractor has 5 days to complete the tasks.
(B)	Each campground/boat launch bag is opened and two of the contractors employees count the envelopes, the count is marked on each facility slip and initialed by both employees and then the envelopes are returned to the original bag.
(C)	An employee takes one bag and opens each envelope and verifies the cash and checks.  This is done by indicating on each envelope whether it is cash, check, or Canadian funds and making the necessary notations when amount does not match what is stated on the envelope.
(D)	Once the contents of the bag are counted all cash and checks must be balanced with the corresponding envelopes.  This is done by running a total on the cash envelopes and the check envelopes as well as the Canadian funds envelopes.  Then total the cash, checks and Canadian funds to make sure they correspond to the envelopes.  Any discrepancy must be resolved before the funds are given to the teller for verification and deposit.  The employee then marks on the facility slip the total cash, checks, and Canadian funds, and initials the slip.  Deposit ticket number must be placed on each slip.
(E)	Once the teller receives the funds they must verify the cash to the facility slip.  The funds are then deposited to a National park Service general ledger account and immediately withdrawn in cashier check form.  The teller then initials the facility slip indicating that the cash verified balances to the slip.  If Canadian funds are involved the teller must calculate the exchange and note it on the slip.
(F)	Once all the bags are completed, separate the campground slips and the boat launch slips and run a total of the cash funds received for each.  Do the same for all checks received.
(G)	Next take all the slips and total all cash, checks and Canadian funds received and get a Park wide total.  Also make a Park wide total of envelopes received and verify it to the total provided by the Park Service.
(H)	Once everything balances all checks must be stamped (stamp is provided by the Park Service).   This can be anywhere from 50-400 checks per week.
(I)	Each campground/boat launch facility slip must be photocopied and the corresponding receipts to the copies retained by the contracting facility and the originals made ready to the Park Service.
(J)	Call the Fee Manger with deposit breakdown (BL totals, CG totals and total deposit).  The Fee Manager will prepare a deposit ticket, fax it to bank/credit union, and then the prepared ticket and the copies are put with the appropriate checks or paper work.  The checks are then bagged for shipment to the Federal Reserve.
(K)	Any Canadian checks must be listed separately on the facility slips.  Call the Fee Manager and a special foreign funds ticket must be prepared. The Fee Manager will fax the special foreign funds ticket to bank/credit union.  The checks are then sent to the appropriate facility.
(L)	The original facility slips and the copies of the deposit tickets (provided by the Park Service) are delivered to the Park Service within 5 working days after receipt.
(M)	Monthly billing is the preferred billing cycle, obtain monthly billing amount by using the weekly facility wide slips and getting a total count of all envelopes processed and total funds collected for the month.
(N)	Any discrepancy between the envelope count provided by the Park Service and that of the contractor must be brought to the attention of the National Park Service contact person immediately.
(O)	All US Funds will be mailed to:
          U.S. Bank
          Las Vegas Cash Vault Mail-In TGA
          P.O. 98999

<DESC>The objective of the contract is to obtain the services of a Senior Health Team Leader/Project Manager who will provide leadership and advisory services on the full range of family planning/reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health and malaria activities including strategic planning for the USAID/Burundi portfolio. The incumbent has the responsibility of understanding and incorporating the Agency's five core values in all respects: 1) customer focus; 2) managing for results; 3) empowerment and accountability; 4) teamwork and participation and 5) valuing diversity.
<p>The incumbent will work at a senior level in a USG foreign assistance program that requires knowledge, experience, maturity, and an ability to function independently in a rapidly growing, highly demanding, and frequently changing environment. The position is located in the USAID office in Bujumbura, Burundi. The Senior Health Team Leader/Project Manager will be leader of the health team, which totals currently 10 members, including the Senior Health Team Leader/Project Manager including specialists in HIV/AIDS, malaria, family planning and reproductive health, supply chain management, and health systems strengthening. S/he will report to the USAID Representative and provide oversight of the health team and overall health portfolio, with direct supervision of the Malaria and PEPFAR team leaders. S/he will be expected to work independently, take initiative, and manage a multi-cultural team with multiple results packages. S/he will advise USAID/Burundi on all aspects of health including HIV/AIDS and the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), family planning (FP), maternal health and child survival, and malaria. The incumbent will represent USAID at the highest government and donor levels.</p>
<p>The Senior Health Team Leader/Project Manager will provide managerial oversight, supervision, and technical guidance to support the implementation of all USAID health programs including its two largest bilateral programs, the Integrated Health Project (IHP) and the PMTCT Acceleration Project. IHP combines many health areas that were historically and separately managed by different teams. The Senior Health Team Leader/Project Manager is expected to coordinate their work and report on the IHP as one consolidated unit. Because of the integrated nature of the program and the importance of HIV/AIDS within the portfolio, the Senior Health Team Leader/Project Manager will ensure synergy and complementarities between HIV/AIDS, family planning/MCH, malaria and all other health-related activities. S/he will also work closely with other USAID teams including economic growth, democracy and governance, and most notable the Food for Peace team which is addressing malnutrition in Burundi.</p>

<p>&bull; The desk has a built-in adjustable keyboard tray or separate surface for keyboards. The keyboard tray is on a separate surface or at a different height than the monitor to ensure proper ergonomic support.</p>
<p>&bull; The desk supports a minimum of 30 pounds of weight while fully supporting the user and remaining stable and secure on the work surface.</p>
<p>&bull; The desk's surface area comfortably accommodates one or two monitors, depending on the model.</p>
<p>Quoters must demonstrate that they are authorized VariDesk resellers.</p>
<p>(xiv) The clauses at FAR 52.217-7, Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989), FAR 52.232-40, Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (DEC 2013); HHSAR 352.203-70, Anti-Lobbying (MAR 2012); and HHSAR 352.222-70, Contractor Cooperation in Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations (JAN 2010), apply to this acquisition.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Technical Capability:<br /></span>Please provide a brief (1 page max) capabilities statement identifying your capabilities in providing the services described in the SOW.&nbsp; Please specifically address your capability in providing maintenance/repairs for Siemens brand fire alarm and sprinkler systems, including your ability and/or experience in working with Siemens proprietary software.

For each project, please include:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Locations supported<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Models of fire protection equipment supported<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.

<p><strong>Government Evaluation:<br /></strong>The Government will award a contract to the <em>lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror</em> whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Capability:</span> In order to be considered technically capable offerors must make clear their capability to meet the requirements in the statement of work. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of capability to maintain and repair fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, pre-reaction systems, or fire extinguishers will make the offer technically unacceptable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Lack of experience with Siemens fire products will make the offer technically unacceptable and ineligible for award. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. A lack of demonstrated ability to meet the required 2 hour emergency response time will make the offeror technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span> The Government will verify the offeror demonstrated minimum 3 years' experience in maintaining fire protection systems of a similar size (or larger) than those contemplated under this combined synopsis/soliciation. DMEA will contact offerors previous customers to verify how successful the offeror's firm was in servicing the identified fire protection systems under those contracts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Lack of experience with comparable projects will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Unsatisfactory performance on previous contracts will result in the offeror being deemed technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span> Quotes will be evaluated to ensure that all labor rates proposed are consistent with industry practices and historical prices paid by the Government for similar services. The Government will verify that the number of hours proposed for completing preventative maintenance work is consistent with industry practices and the Government's experience on similar work.</p>
<p><strong>Representations and Certifications: </strong>To be eligible for contract award, vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM): <a href="http://www.SAM.gov">www.SAM.gov</a>. If not registered at this time, vendors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their quote. If a prospective successful offeror cannot become registered by two (2) weeks after the date proposals are due, their quote will be considered non-responsive and award will be made to the next lowest-priced technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Because DMEA is a secure facility, DMEA staff will escort all maintenance workers around the facility and during performance. Upon completion, the COR will inspect all work to ensure all maintenance was performed, all necessary repairs were made, and that the system is functioning properly. When remedial emergency maintenance is required, DMEA will contact the contractor to schedule the repair work. If the Government determines that the cause of any needed repairs is the fault of the contractor, the repairs shall be made at no cost to the Government.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC><p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and FAR Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NIH-OLAO-OD3-RFQ3602620, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-79). This acquisition will be processed as a fixed price requirement and is not a small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 811219, and the small-business size standard is $20.5 million. <br />The National Institutes of Health is in need of a contractor to provide preventive maintenance services for the following: 1) 20x20x38 Century Gravity Sterilizer (Serial Number: 011309506); 2) 20x20x38 Century Vacuum Sterilizer (Serial Number: 013109503); and F-A GMP Sterilizer 61515-D DD (Serial Number: 013639504).</p>
<p>The contractor will provide comprehensive services to include all parts and labor to perform scheduled preventive maintenance in accordance with the current Preventive Maintenance Checklist and unscheduled repair visits, provided that parts required during unscheduled repair visits are not subject to parts exclusions. Please see the Statement of Work for further information.</p>
<p>Evaluations will be conducted on a Best Value basis with tradeoffs. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award(s) to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on other factors.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01010001
<CONTACT>WELCH, SARAH J
<DESC>Amendment 1 to P15PS00160 adds a required introductory paragraph.  For clarity, the entire RFQ is posted with the amendment.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations (RFQ #P15PS00160) and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-79.  This action is set-aside for small businesses under NAICS 324110, Petroleum Refiners.   A Wholesale Trade or Retail Trade business concern submitting a quote on a supply acquisition is categorized as a non-manufacturer and deemed small if it has 500 or fewer employees and meets the requirements of 13 CFR 121.406.  The National Park Service (NPS) encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a requirements contract to the responsible quoter whose total quote is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.  We reserve the right to cancel this solicitation. 

BACKGROUND
The NPS owns and operates numerous buildings and facilities in Stehekin, Washington, including offices, warehouses, and employee housing, many of which use propane for heating and/or cooking.  We have an ongoing need for propane deliveries, particularly during the winter months.  This solicitation will lead to an indefinite delivery requirements contract for propane to be delivered for up to five years (awarded as a base period plus four option years).  An estimated target price and estimated quantity will be stated for each year, with both allowed to fluctuate during the contract period.  The total contract price for the five years is expected to be <$100,000 and the total quantity delivered per year is estimated to be between 8,000 and 11,000 gallons.  

LOCATION
Stehekin is located at the head of Lake Chelan, 55 miles from the town of Chelan, WA, within Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Maps, description, accommodations, and services may be viewed at www.nps.gov/lach or www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/stehekin.htm or www.stehekinvalley.com.  The only access is by public passenger-only ferry, barge, private vessel, or float plane from Chelan.  Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and it is recommended that Contractors verify scheduled runs and costs, or cost of charter runs, with the barge company before submitting an offer.   The propane tanks to be serviced in this contract are within twelve miles of the boat/barge landing.

STATEMENT OF WORK
The work to be performed under this contract consists of delivering liquid propane gas (LPG) to specified tanks in the Stehekin valley in accordance with federal, state, and county regulations and the following specifications.  Propane tanks are shown below.   The specific house tanks and sizes to be filled under this contract may vary through time and may be unilaterally adjusted at any time during the contract period by written notification from the Contracting Officer (CO) or their Representative (COR) to the Contractor.  Tanks at the maintenance yard, the Golden West visitor center, and the wastewater treatment plant will always be filled under this contract.  

Houses (with tank size in gallons): High Bridge cabin (250), Yurts (125), Leaf (500), Russel (500), New Castle (1,000), Boulder (1,000), Wilsey (500), Imus (500), and Hilton (500).   High Bridge is located approximately 12 miles north of the barge/boat landing and the rest are located at or within four miles north of the landing.

Facilities (with tank size in gallons): Maintenance yard (500), Golden West (1,000), and Wastewater treatment plant (500).

Contractor shall deliver propane to each tank approximately once per month, except the High Bridge cabin tank, which can be filled less frequently.  Delivered amounts will be enough to Â¿top offÂ¿ each specified tank to at least 70% full.  Delivery shall take place during regular business hours (8:00 am-4:30 pm, Monday through Friday) and should be coordinated with the Stehekin Maintenance Foreman or designee, who will inspect the service and confirm the delivered amount. Delivery shall be accomplished in a safe manner, in accordance with the regulations listed below, and without damage to National Park Service or other property.  

NPS staff will monitor the LPG level in each tank listed above.  If propane level falls below 30% at any tank between monthly deliveries, NPS staff will notify contractor who will schedule an additional LPG delivery as soon as possible.

Occasionally, NPS will bring small, portable tanks to the contractor's facility to be filled.  

APPLICABLE REGULATIONS
Shipping and transfer of flammable gases are regulated by the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  Specific licensing and permit requirements are codified in CFR, Title 49, Parts 100-177 and Parts 383-399 as well as elsewhere.  The regulations pertain to the loading and unloading of flammable gas, accidents, inspections, certification of operators, drug testing, and other safety aspects of the transfer operation; it is the contractor's sole responsibility to research and comply with all pertinent regulations during the performance of this contract.  

The offeror shall furnish the Contracting Officer acceptable evidence showing that required licenses and certifications have been obtained, including drivers' state-issued commercial driver's licenses with hazardous materials endorsement.  If, during the contract performance period, there is a change in Contractor's personnel, the Contractor shall furnish evidence that the new employees meet these requirements.

INVOICING AND PAYMENT
Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices monthly.  Each itemized invoice shall identify the date, location, quantity, and current price for each delivery, as well as the invoice total.  Payment will be by electronic funds transfer to the bank account identified in the vendor's SAM record.  Terms are net 30 days, unless a prompt payment discount is offered and accepted.  The Contractor shall electronically upload their invoices to www.IPP.gov, after obtaining instructions regarding which purchase order line to post the amounts against; refer to IPP clause.

The price charged to the government shall be the same or lower than the bulk price charged to the contractorÂ¿s other customers for deliveries in the same time period.  Because the cost of propane may vary, the price of propane delivered under this contract may fluctuate, upward or downward.  If the price change is within 10% of the target estimated price for each year, no formal notification or contract modification is required.  If, however, the price increases by more than 10% from the target, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing before any monthly deliveries are made at the higher price.  The contractor may charge a fixed per-gallon delivery fee above the bulk price to cover the cost of our contract requirements; this price shall be stated in the quote for each performance period. 

PRICE SCHEDULE
The target price for bulk propane delivered to houses and facilities (FOB Destination) may be different from the target price for filling portable tanks at the ContractorÂ¿s facility (FOB Origin).

For each performance period, list a target price for bulk propane (per gallon) delivered to buildings, the separate administrative fee (per gallon), if applicable, and a target price for filling portable tanks.  NPS estimates <10,000 gallons will be required each year.  

Base period	January 1, 2015	- November 30, 2015			
Option Year 1	December 1, 2015 - November 30, 2016			
Option Year 2	December 1, 2016 - November 30, 2017

<CONTACT>Sornberger, Yvette
<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 000002 is to answer the following two questions:

1.  Q:  With regard to your current RFP for a couple of ICPMSs, can you tell me what brand and revision of LIMS software that you have and a little bit about what kind of interface that the end user would like, i.e. unidirectional with results going out from the ICPMS to the LIMS, or bidirectional with autosampler tables being populated from the LIMS and results going back out?

1.  A:  We are currently running version 9.381.004 of the StarLIMS executable.  It would be good to point out that we are planning an upgrade to StarLIMS 11 in the next few years.

The question about unidirectional vs bidirectional is trickier. Right now, we do send information via worklists to the instrument and then the instrument sends results back to LIMS, but there is no actual connection between LIMS and the instrument (such as a serial comm RS232 or USB). We do all of this communication via files.

<a href="mailto:travis.james3@us.army.mil">Travis James</a>
<DESC><br/><br/>****NOTICE:  THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REVISED AS FOLLOWS****<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing M153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) systems and spare parts, recapitalization/reset/overhaul of previously delivered M153 CROWS systems, and CROWS engineering and logistics support.  The total contract value is estimated at $970M. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The U.S. Government intends to satisfy the above CROWS requirements through a Firm Fixed Price, Full and Open Competition, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), single award contract.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  The SOW will include:<br/><br/>I. Production of CROWS (total quantity estimated at 3,000 systems) and spare parts.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 50 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 150 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Product improvements, integrations, and testing.   <br/><br/>III.    Training, overhaul, depot-level, field maintenance support, recapitalization/reset of CROWS, and general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification includes the performance requirements and technical drawings.  The detail specification states the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and how the components are to be fabricated or constructed.  The detail specification does not include technical drawings and assembly procedures for some sub-assemblies, which are to be made by qualified directed sources at least until the First Article Testing phase.  This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between the new CROWS producer and commonality/interchangeability with existing CROWS systems.  The U.S. Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation: <br/> <br/> - Detail Specification<br/> - Performance requirements<br/> - Technical Drawings<br/> - Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/> - Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/> - Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/> - Assembly procedures<br/> - List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/> - Quality requirements <br/> - Test requirements<br/> - Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be released nor will prospective contractors have access to it at any time. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the U.S. Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be addressed through a software change process between the U.S. Government and the prospective Contractor. <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be provided upon request after the Request for Proposals release provided that all prerequisite paper work (described below) is properly completed, submitted, and approved.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement<br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  All other foreign companies shall be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements.  The countries of Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway are exempt from ITAR restrictions in accordance with 22 CFR 125.4(c) for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and solicitation; however these countries shall be ITAR compliant before a contract award.

be added to an Offerors proposal in the total price evaluation as per FAR

<DESC>Please note the response date listed with this pre-solicitation notice is not the actual due date.  The actual due date will be stated in the solicitation. This pre-solicitation notice is for lodging within 10 miles of 5722 Integrity Dr., Bldg 751, Millington, TN 38054.  The award will be a fixed price purchase order with a period of performance of one year with a one-year option period.  Target start date is 9 Jan 15.  The contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies, services, and materials, as noted in the solicitation.   The location of the hotel is required to be within a ten-mile radius from Millington, TN 38054. Housing is needed to support the 4th Brigade, 100th Division and subordinate Battalions to enhance the US Army capabilities to train Active and Reserve medical soldier in support of the War efforts and other contingency operations. The facility should be able to support at least 10 double man rooms per night for event dates from January 2015-December 2016 (base + one option year). The Hotel shall have a Business Center at no cost to the soldiers as well as on-site washers and dryers. A Room Roster will be sent to the contractor by the Government Point of Contact or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within 30 days prior to the scheduled unit assemblies.  This acquisition is resolicit as unrestricted for open market under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 721110, size standard of $30 Million.  This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). The solicitation will be posted on or about 22 December 14 via Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.  The due date will be stated in the solicitation.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to review the web page for notice of amendments, updates or changes to the solicitation.  No hard copies will be mailed.  To be eligible for award, prospective offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Internet site, www.sam.gov, under the appropriate NAICS.

This pre-solicitation notice is for lodging within 10 miles of 5722 Integrity Dr., Bldg 751, Millington, TN 38054.  The award will be a fixed price purchase order with a period of performance of one year with a one-year option period.  Target start date is 9 Jan 15.

The location of the hotel is required to be within a ten-mile radius from Millington, TN 38054. Housing is needed to support the 4th Brigade, 100th Division and subordinate Battalions to enhance the US Army capabilities to train Active and Reserve medical soldier in support of the War efforts and other contingency operations. The facility should be able to support at least 10 double man rooms per night for event dates from January 2015-December 2016 (base + one option year).

For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.

The solicitation will be posted on or about 22 December 14 via Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.  The due date will be stated in the solicitation.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.       <br>               <br>       The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.       <br>              <br>       The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.         <br>                    <br>       This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.         <br>              <br>       If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.        <br>              <br>       The above discussed intent is subject to change.        <br>            <br>      ---Change 1---       <br>             <br>      The purpose of this change is to provide an updated Manpack Radio request for information document for proposed CPD changes.  The updates are included in the newly added Section 3 Proposed CPD Mission Weight Detail.  Submission instructions remain unchanged from the original announcement.     <br>          <br>      ---Change 2---       <br>          <br>     The purpose of this change is to extend the submission date and revise the submission instructions for responses to the proposed CPD requirements changes.     <br>          <br>     All questions/comments pertaining to the document posted today shall be submitted no later than November 7, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil.  Questions/comments should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats.  E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size.  If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate e-mail messages.  Reference W15P7T-15-R-0004 in the e-mail subject.  All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.  Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.       <br>              <br>     All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.    <br>        <br>    ---Change 3---    <br>        <br>    The purpose of this change to this announcement is to conduct a new Request for Information (RFI) for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radios. Please note that this new RFI is separate from the initial RFI posted under this announcement for solicitation number W15P7T15R0004 regarding changes to CPD requirements, which is still in effect.    <br>        <br>    The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to integrate onto Government specified vehicle mounts including the AN/VRC-116 Single Manpack Tray Assembly, the AN/VRC-117 Dual Manpack Tray Assembly, and the Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) Manpack Universal Tray.  This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.  The results of this survey are non-binding, and will be considered proprietary information, not to be shared outside of Governmental personnel.    <br>        <br>    Please see the attached document entitled  quote mark Vehicle Integration RFI quote mark  for details about the information the Government is requesting for this RFI.    <br>        <br>    To assist in responding to this RFI the Government will provide, at request, specification documents for the vehicle mounts. To obtain a copy of these specification documents, send a request via email to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) / National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH)/Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) in Atlanta, GA, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price Purchase Order to Abbott Informatics Corporation of Hollywood, FL. The contractor will provide fifteen (15) STARLIMS Public Health Full Concurrent Licenses and fifteen (15) maintenance plans for these licenses. These software products are proprietary to Abbott Informatics and not available from other sources. This software has been used by CDC-NCEH-DLS for over five years to manage all the lab-specific administrative and data storage processes. Other laboratory management software systems are not interchangeable, and to try to integrate another system with STARLIMS would be time consuming and costly and possibly interfere with the on-going research.
<p><br />This Procurement is for Commercial Items as defined by FAR Parts 2 &amp; 12.</p>
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within 15&nbsp;days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any quotation/response must be emailed to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov before 11:00 AM on&nbsp;Wednesday, January 7, 2015.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Noridian Healthcare Solutios, LLC under the current contract number HHSM-500-2012-M0012Z in the amount of $230,150 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>This is a notice for Market Research Information ONLY to obtain best industry practices concerning full food services.  NO AWARD will be made from this notice. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will be hosting an Industry Day for the food service industry at Clarksburg, WV on January 6, 2015. The purpose this Industry Day is to obtain information from the food service community pertaining to best practices for operating and maintaining cafeteria style dining facilities.  No award will be made from this Request for Information (RFI).  No solicitation, specifications, or drawings are available at this time. 

Background

The Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS) has approximately 2,400 employees.  By late 2015, total population of employees and contractors with access to the cafeteria-style dining facility on the campus located at 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, West Virginia (WV) will be approximately 3,000.  Due to the distance and scarcity of alternative food options, many employees utilize the food services on a daily basis. The FBI would like to offer all patrons high quality, healthy dining options.  The food service facilities include a cafeteria in the main building of the CJIS Division campus, International Conference Room, and the newly constructed Biometric Technology Center scheduled for occupancy mid-year 2015.  

The cafeteria in the main building of the CJIS Division campus occupies approximately 24,980 square feet (sf) and is centrally located on the ground floor of the Main Complex. This includes the following areas: Food preparation area (8,700 sf), serving area (7,650 sf), and dining area (8,000 sf). The approximate size of the potential second location adjacent to the main building is 11,200 sf.

The FBI is interested in obtaining information from contractors who have experience in providing food services in a cafeteria setting.  This Industry Day will be an open forum to discuss contract type, term, menu, and service.  The FBI is interested in discussing options for changing its traditional cafeteria into a place where employees can enjoy a quality food and the contractor can execute a success operation.

Contractors who have experience providing all administrative management, supervision, labor, meal planning, ordering of food products, unloading, storage, preparation, serving, clean up and facility maintenance are preferred, but all are welcome to attend.  In addition, catering services may be required on various occasions.  All interested parties are requested to provide detailed information to include, but not limited to, best practices as it relates to the following:
-Menu Planning 
-Nutrition
-Food Preparation 
-Consumption Analysis
-Pricing/Payment Options 
-Dining Amenities
-Sanitation 
-Equipment Procurement
-Management Responsibilities & education
-Personnel Security/Background

This information will need to be submitted after the Industry Day to allow prospective vendors the opportunity to incorporate any observations from the site visit or FBI requirements into its package.  Please submit all information packages to the Contracting Officer at:

HQ Federal Bureau of Investigation
ATTN: Almeta Austin, RM 6329
935 Pennsylvania Ave, NW
Washington, D.C. 20535

The Industry Day will be held at the 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, West Virginia January  6, 2015. The conference will begin at 9:30 am and end at 12:30 pm. You must register in advance.

<SOLNBR>IARPA-BAA-15-06
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>011415
<ARCHDATE>03232015
<CONTACT>Robert Rahmer, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-15-06@iarpa.gov
<DESC>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Cyber-attack Automated Unconventional Sensor Environment (CAUSE) Program on January 21, 2015, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the Program. The Conference will be held from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM EDT in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the Conference will be to provide introductory information on CAUSE and the research problems that the Program aims to address, to respond to questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and identify potential team partners.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this Program.   IARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposers' Day.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM GOALS</p>
<p>Approaches to cyber defense typically focus on post-mortem analysis of the various attack vectors utilized by adversaries.  As attacks have evolved and increased over the years, established approaches (e.g., signature-based detection, anomaly detection) have not adequately enabled cybersecurity practitioners to get ahead of these threats.  This has led to an industry that has invested heavily in analyzing the effects of cyber-attacks instead of analyzing and mitigating the "cause" of cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The CAUSE Program seeks to develop cyber-attack forecasting methods and detect emerging cyber phenomena to assist cyber defenders with the earliest detection of a cyber-attack (e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), successful spearphishing, successful drive-by, remote exploitation, unauthorized access, reconnaissance).  The CAUSE Program aims to develop and validate unconventional multi-disciplined sensor technology (e.g., actor behavior models, black market sales) that will forecast cyber-attacks and complement existing advanced intrusion detection capabilities.  Anticipated innovations include: methods to manage and extract huge amounts of streaming and batch data, the application and introduction of new and existing features from other disciplines to the cyber domain, and the development of models to generate probabilistic warnings for future cyber events.  Successful proposers will combine cutting-edge research with the ability to develop robust forecasting capabilities from multiple sensors not typically used in the cyber domain.</p>
<p>The CAUSE Program will consist of both unclassified and optional classified research activities and expects to draw upon the strengths of academia and industry through collaborative teaming.  It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary and might include computer scientists, data scientists, social and behavioral scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, content extraction experts, information theorists, and cyber-security subject matter experts having applied experience with cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>Attendees must register no later than 6:00 pm EDT, January 14, 2015 at http://events.SignUp4.com/CAUSEPDRegistration_January2015. Directions to the Conference facility and other materials will be provided upon registration. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 250 registrants. <span><span><span style="background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">If  there are more registrants than available seats, priority will be given  to the first two registrants from each organization. </span></span></span>All attendees will be required to present government-issued photo identification to enter the event. Non-U.S. citizens will be required to present passports.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The afternoon will include unclassified Presentation and Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for teaming opportunities may submit a request through the registration website. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the Conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar organizations that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment or real property, will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>Questions concerning Conference and registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@iarpa.gov. Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-15-06@iarpa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to add additional details: To get a VSWR measurement, there should be two power detectors on the meter: forward and reverse. It should start by turning on the forward RF detector and begin sampling every 10 microseconds. If the meter detects a signal, it will take 500 samples (for a total of 5 milliseconds). If there is no signal detected, the meter would keep sampling for up to 40,000 samples (for a total of 400 milliseconds) looking for a pulse. In this sense, the sampling period is between 5 milliseconds and 400 milliseconds depending on when it first sees a pulse. The same process applies for the reverse power detector. The meter should display a reading every 1.04 seconds.

The information herein below is released for wide dissemination to all parties and is indicative only. The information is subject to modification and is in no way binding to government and the estimate is based on the best information available at this time.</p>
<p>The United States Government (USG), represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the USAID/Kenya Afya Jijini (Nairobi) program and the Afya Pwani (Coast) program. The purpose of this solicitation will be to identify a qualified contractor to implement this new Afya Jijini (Nairobi) program and the Afya Pwani (Coast) program. The primary objective of the Afya Jijini (Nairobi) program and the Afya Pwani (Coast) program is to contribute to the USAID/Kenya (USAID/K) Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) Development Objective (DO) 2 "Health and Human Capacity Strengthened", Intermediate Result (IR) 2.1 "Increased use of quality health services". The activities will build on experiences and lessons learned from the previous integrated health service delivery activities, including the most recent AIDS, Population and Health Integrated Assistance Plus (APHIAplus) Nairobi-Coast, and ensure coordination and communication among development counterparts. The goal is to contribute to CDCS Sub-Intermediate Result 2.2.2 "Improved county-level accountability, institutional capacity, leadership, and management of health service delivery". The purpose of the activity is improved and increased access and utilization of quality health services through strengthened service delivery and institutional capacity of county health systems. To achieve this goal, the USAID/Kenya Afya Jijini (Nairobi) program and the Afya Pwani (Coast) program will focus on three sub-purposes and output areas for the activity as follows: Sub-Purpose 1: Increased and Expanded Utilization of Quality HIV Services; Sub-Purpose 2: Focused Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health; Family Planning; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Nutrition Services; Sub-Purpose 3: Strengthened County Health Systems.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about October 7, 2014. This notice does not obligate USAID to issue a solicitation or award a contract, nor does it commit the US Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals.</p>
<p>Subject to availability of funds, the Government plans to award two separate Cost-Plus- Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion type contracts - one for the Afya Jijini program and one for the Afya Pwani program - for anticipated base periods of three years and the contract shall include two option periods for one year each, making the maximum length of each contract five (5) years. The exercise of option(s) is subject to availability of funds, USG need for the program and satisfactory Contractor performance work under contract.</p>
<p>The maximum overall estimated cost of this procurement is $86 - $88 million. The Afya Jijini Program is estimated to be in the range of $34-$35 million (total costs and fee, if any). The Afya Pwani program is estimated to be in the range of $52-53 million (total costs and fee, if any). The Government is in no way obligated to make an award within this range.</p>
<p>USAID will conduct this procurement through full and open competition, under which any type of organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 shall apply.</p>
<p>Any comment/question regarding this pre-solicitation notice should be directed to the Regional Acquisition and Assistance Office, USAID/East Africa, at the following addresses: Camille Hasha, Contracting Officer, email: chasha@usaid.gov and Rose Kinuthia, Acquisition &amp; Assistance Specialist, email: rkinuthia@usaid.gov.</p>

<DESC>Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of <br> SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the -One Door to the Corps- via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br>  <br> WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0014 <br>  <br> Pre-solicitation Synopsis Notice   Small Business Request for Proposal (RFP) for  Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. <br>  <br> The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Ms. Jennifer Fox at 817-886-1220, e-mail Jennifer.R.Fox@usace.army.mil. <br>  <br> FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.  All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing via email to the Contract Specialist as noted above. Anticipated Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are based upon the projected requirements for Southwest Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas.  Estimated value for this MATOC pool is $537,840,000.00.  This solicitation is one of four solicitations to be placed under the approved Acquisition Plan for construction within SWD and its surrounding areas. <br>  <br> SCOPE OF WORK:  Construction services are to include, but is not limited to: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  Anticipated execution of MATOC contracts are intended for new construction, design-build and design-bid-build facilities. In addition, to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.   <br>  <br> The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the Small Business MATOC pool with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $25,000,000 and a minimum task order limitation of $2,500.  The maximum combination of orders is $75,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of Small Business contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the Small Business MATOC contract is $2,500 that applies to the base period only. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  <br>  <br> CONTRACT INFORMATION: Small Business solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as  quote mark Offerors quote mark ) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   <br>  <br> The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: <br>  <br>  	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach    <br>  <br> 	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than Price (Volume 3).   <br>  <br> Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 3/15/2013 under solicitation number W9126G-13-R-0014.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 09/13/2012.  (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit, it will be conducted after the Phase 2 selection has been made.  Details regarding the Conference will be provided by amendment to the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.     <br>  <br> MATOC:  Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated SOW.    All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.     <br>  <br> The total estimated contract capacity is $537,840,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.   <br>  <br> The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive Small Businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract.  <br>  <br>

Phase1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 06/03/2013. (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition. Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded. If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the unawarded capacity. Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation. The total estimated contract capacity is $537,840,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. <br>  <br> The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive Small Businesses only. Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE USED FOR MARKET ANALYSIS ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS SYNOPSIS. NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED CONCERNS DOING WORK UNDER NAICS 236220. ANY POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION(S) THAT MAY PROCEED FROM THIS NOTICE WILL BE POSTED TO FEDBIZOPPS. ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AT A LATER TIME IF AND WHEN A SOLICITATION IS ISSUED.  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, will use information obtained under this sources sought to develop a design and acquisition strategy to meet the requirements for the construction of the new FY16 DODEA Elementary School to be located at the U.S. Army Garrison, West Point, NY.  <br>  Currently, the US Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) is in the planning stages for a new two (2)-story, approximately 96,000 square foot elementary school with a school population of approximately about 500 students ( Pre-Kindergarten through the 4th Grade) to be located at the U.S. Army Garrison, West Point, NY.  <br>  One of the construction methods being considered for the project is the use of insulating concrete forms (ICF) for the building envelope. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are rigid plastic foam forms that hold concrete in place during curing and remain in place afterwards to serve as thermal insulation for concrete walls. The three basic form types are hollow foam blocks, foam planks held together with plastic ties, and 4' x 8' panels with integral foam or plastic ties. ICFs can be used to form various structural configurations, such as a standard wall, post and beam, or grid. They provide backing for interior and exterior finishes.  <br>  In order to consider the use of ICFs in the construction of the elementary school, the US Army Corps of Engineers seeks to determine the availability of experienced suppliers and contractors who have experience using this method of construction.  <br>  The market research survey seeks to identify industry's experience and capabilities to provide insulated concrete forms in the execution of this project. Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis answering the questions in the attached questionnaire and providing information of at least two (2) relevant projects in which insulating concrete forms were used in the construction of the facility.  <br>  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542; and a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 Million. This sources sought is requesting responses from all Small Businesses under the size standard, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.   <br>  A project will be considered relevant if it meets the following criteria:  <br>  Order of Magnitude: Projects with a construction cost greater than or equal to $10 million.  <br>  Size:  Two stories or greater and/or a square footage in excess of 50,000 GSF.  <br>  Project must have been completed within the last (7) years.  <br>  Offerors responding to this Market Research Synopsis shall be limited to information required above and shall be submitted no later than 1600 (4 pm) EST on 30 December 2014. Provide the attached Information Request Form and associated project information to orlando.nieves@usace.army.mil  <br>    <br>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #A00001 TO REQUEST FOR SF 330s
VA69D-14-I-0884
22 December 2014
The purpose of this amendment is to amend the Request for SF 330s.
The following evaluation criteria in the initial request for SF 330s are deleted in its entirety:
Qualifications of responding firms should include but not limited to the evaluation factors below in descending order of importance:
1.	Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm (including a joint venture or association) with the type of design services required
2.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project
3.	Past record of performance on Contracts with the Department of Veterans' Affairs
4.	Professional capacity of the firm in the designated geographic area of the project to perform work
5.	Maintaining project schedules and project budgets
6.	Knowledge in design and construction requirements 
7.	Cost control effectiveness and estimating accuracy
8.	Location and Facilities of Working Offices to support Project

The evaluation criteria above are replaced as follows:
The following evaluation factors will be used to evaluate the qualifications of responding firms:
1) Specialized Experience & Technical Competence of the Firm.
2) Specific Experience & Qualifications of Personnel Proposed for Assignment to the Project.
3) Maintaining Project Schedules & Project Budgets.
4) Knowledge in Design & Construction Requirements.
5) Cost Control Effectiveness
6) Location & Facilities of Working Offices
This request for SF 330s remains as a 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  In accordance with VAAR 819.7003(b), SDVOSB firms must be verified in the VIP database or hold a "Re-verification" symbol listed next to the firm's name prior to submitting an SF330 on this solicitation.  All interested parties must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).  If you are not registered with SAM, you may register online at http://www.sam.gov.

The A/E firm should be located within a 200 mile radius of CAPT James A. Lovell Federal Healthcare Center, North Chicago, Illinois.  The desired area of consideration is within a 200 mile radius of the CAPT James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center.  This location is requested to aid in the event issues with the design or construction arise for ease rectification. Responses received outside the 200 mile radius may receive a lower rating during the evaluation process.  The 200 mile radius will be determined using the following website: http://www.freemaptools.com/raius-around-point.htm.

FAR clause 52.219-14 is hereby deleted from the previous Request for SF 330s and replaced with VAAR 852.219-10. Therefore, prospective firms are reminded that per VAAR 852.219-10 and by its submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for services (except construction) that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.

A/E firms, which originally submitted SF 330s are hereby given the opportunity to submit a new SF 330 package by noon on Wednesday, December 24, 2014 and are asked to acknowledge this amendment by noon on Wednesday, December 24, 2014. 

If a new package is not submitted by noon on Wednesday, December 24, 2014, the VA will assume that the offeror wants the VA to treat its original package as a new submission.

Submittals will be evaluated per the revised evaluation factors listed above.  Complete SF 330 packages are to be either:

<DESC>The KanguruClone Hard Drive Duplicator 14HD-SATA is used within Project Manager Mission Command's Tactical Ground System to provide Replication, Duplication, Installation and Training (RDIT) of various software, images and Information Assurance products. At the time, the KanguruClone Hard Drive Duplicator is the only product that has demonstrated an ability to duplicate large hard drives (i.e. 2 terabytes), regardless of drive brand-name, without errors. All other comparable networked Hard Drive Duplicators on the market have produced errors when duplicating large drives and/or do not duplicate all brand-name drives resulting in delays being sustained. Thus, the brand-name KanguruClone Hard Drive Duplicator is the only available product to meet Government requirements.
