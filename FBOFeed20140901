<p>(viii) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (APR 2014) applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition as follows:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the<br />responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor A -- APPROACH AND CAPABILITIES - Offerors will be evaluated based on their corporate and individual qualifications to perform the work; adequacy of equipment, materials and facilities proposed; and experience with the types of operations identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor B -- PAST PERFORMANCE -- Performance by the quoter and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to all solicitation requirements will be evaluated. The evaluation will include the quality of supplies and services previously performed, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction and indication of ability to improve performance through proactive management. Evaluation of this factor will be based on the information contained in the proposal and information provided by references. The government may evaluate past performance by contacting references and/or other sources and may also consider other information available.</p>
<p>Factor C - PRICE</p>
<p>Factors A and B are considered to be substantially more important than price in this evaluation process.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offer or if the contracting officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the government.</p>
<p>Note that any and all costs associated with proposal preparation, are the responsibility of the quoter and will not be reimbursed by the government.</p>

<p>(xiii) The following additional clauses are also applicable to this acquisition: Department of Commerce Clauses:</p>
<p>1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY<br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br />Paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>1. Price</p>
<p>2. Technical Capability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof that the training services meet the minimum standards of Item Descriptions, and Quality Products (i.e., instructor credentials and/or training data shall be attached to the price proposal). See attachment one (1) for scope of service and part descriptions. All offerors shall submit description of the service being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>(ii) Next, the Government will evaluate the lowest offeror's technical information as referenced in paragraph (a) 2 above. Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as "acceptable" or "unacceptable" by personnel designated in 374 CS.</p>
<p>(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a) 2, a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then evaluate the next low offeror in the same manner to determine if they meet the technical <br />capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</p>
<p><br />252.225-7043 Antiterrorism/Force Protection for Defense Contractors Outside the United States (MAR 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "United States," as used in this clause means, the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.</p>

<p>(3) Provide, to Contractor and subcontractor personnel, antiterrorism/force protection awareness information commensurate with that which the Department of Defense (DoD) provides to its military and civilian personnel and their families, to the extent such information can be made available prior to travel outside the United States; and</p>
<p>(4) Obtain and comply with the most current antiterrorism/force protection guidance for Contractor and subcontractor personnel.</p>
<p>(c) The requirements of this clause do not apply to any subcontractor that is:</p>

<p>(d) Information and guidance pertaining to DoD antiterrorism/force protection can be obtained from 374aw.atfp@us.af.mil or DSN 225-6340.</p>
