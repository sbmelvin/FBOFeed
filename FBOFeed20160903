<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.&nbsp; Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.
<p><br />Background: <br />The 91st CST Analytical Laboratory System (ALS) has a requirement for a "Liquid Nitrogen Generator (LN2)". The ALS requires a constant supply of liquid nitrogen (LN2) to operate the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) for Proficiency Analytical Testing and to maintain an incident response ready posture. Currently, LN2 has to be ordered and delivered on an average monthly frequency from a local gas supply company. An alternative to LN2 cylinder rental and gas delivery is a liquid nitrogen generator, which pulls nitrogen from the air and compresses it to a liquid state. Consumables for LN2 generators typically consist of electricity and single filter replacement on an as needed basis, which is also the only regular maintenance requirement noted by various manufacturers.</p>
<p>Minimum Specifications Required:<br />a. 115VAC 60Hz, Single Phase voltage supply<br />b. No larger than 36"(W) x 36"(L) x 72"(H) footprint<br />c. Up to 8 Liters per day LN2 production<br />d. Transfer tube from LN2 generator to portable storage dewar</p>
<p>Any information, brochures, pamphlets, or capability statements from vendors would be appreciated.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is F1M2X56211AW01. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intents to award a sole source contract IET Labs INC for the 437th Maintenance Squadron (437 MXS) at Joint Base Charleston (JBCHS)- Air Base, SC.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to IET Labs INC; 1202 VFW Parkway, West Roxbury, MA, 02132-4208. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to repair and calibrate an IET RS925D Resistance Decade for 437 MXS at JBCHS.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) One source is capable of providing due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and software.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: IET Labs INC., a small business, is the sole designer, manufacturer, service provider and distributor of the ET RS925D Resistance Decade requiring repair. All parts, equipment and information necessary to perform this service is proprietary to IET and not made available to other vendors.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of GSA was conducted but no sources capable of providing the repair were identified. A search of the open market within industry (NAICS 334416) was conducted. Four companies were contacted via telephone, however, none of the four companies were able to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: IET does not have any authorized service providers and individual replacement parts are not available for resale. In order to complete the necessary repair, the unit must be sent to the manufacturer. Any damage to the equipment caused by an unauthorized service provider would result in replacement costs in excess of $15k..</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: N/A</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />The Government will surveille the market for any changes or new entries to the market place that may allow for the use of other vendors in future requirements.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intents to award a sole source contract T-Metrics INC for the 628th Medical Group (628 MDG) at Joint Base Charleston (JBCHS)- Air Base, SC.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to T-Metrics INC; 4430 Stuart Andrew Blvd, Charlotte NC 28217-1543. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii).

<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to upgrade the existing T-Metric (TM) 2000 ACD port drivers for the communication distribution system for 628 MDG at JBCHS. Conversion of the existing CS-1000 TDM switch to an Avaya CM6 TDM Switch is required in order for the system to be inter-operable with existing network and facilitate compliance with the DoD Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) migration.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) One source is capable of providing due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and software.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The system currently in place utilizes software proprietary to the manufacture, T-Metrics. The drivers that are needed are only manufactured and supported by T-Metrics. Additionally, T-Metrics does not have any authorized services providers and does not allow other vendors to service or alter their equipment. If an unauthorized service provider were to alter or service the communication system, it would void the current sustainment agreement.</p>

<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of GSA and the open market was conducted but no sources capable of providing the service were found. The Manufacturer was contacted and queried about authorized service providers, to which they identified they do not have.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: In order to use another vendor, the port drivers would have to be replaced and another brand tested to ensure compatability with the entire communication distribution system- resulting in substantial duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: N/A</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD in support of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed priced award for software. The authority for the sole source justification and other than full and open competition procedures will be FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) Only One Source Reasonably Available.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 511210.</p>
<p>The vendor for this requirement is Qiagen, Inc.  Qiagen is the manufacturer and sole distributor of their software.  There are no licensed authorized resellers.</p>
<p>The Diagnostic Systems Division (DSD) of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) requires Qiagen software to analyze large amounts of scientific data, specifically gene expression, proteomics, and metabolomics data in the context of signaling cascades/pathways and systems biology.  This software is necessary for analysis of large amounts of data that require a systems-based analysis.  This action is for a software renewal of five licenses currently in use by the USAMRIID DSD. The milestones of a Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funded research effort are based on the systems biology capabilities of Qiagen software.  Continued usage of this software is necessary to enable future research to correlate with present and past data analysis and to provide comparable, accurate and precise data results.  It is not possible to deviate from continued use of this software; lack of continued usage of Qiagen software would abrogate continuity and violate established research protocols.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided.  No request for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD in support of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed priced award for TaqMan Gene Expression customized plated assays.  The authority for the sole source justification and other than full and open competition procedures will be FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) Only One Source Reasonably Available.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 325414.</p>
<p>There are several competing technologies available for gene expression analysis using real-time PCR, but the most widely used are 5' nuclease assays utilizing TaqMan&reg; self-quenching probes and SYBR&reg; Green intercalating dye-based assays.  Whereas multiple vendors offer off-the-shelf SYBR&reg; Green-based real-time PCR assays targeting specific host genes, ThermoFisher Scientific, dba Life Technologies, holds exclusive rights to TaqMan&reg; real-time PCR assay technology, and they do not utilize third-party distributors for their predesigned inventoried or made-to-order TaqMan Gene Expression Assays.</p>
<p>USAMRIID's Diagnostic Systems Division (DSD) has ongoing Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) funded Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts to identify and verify host biomarkers indicative of various infectious disease states.  For past efforts, USAMRIID has utilized both SYBR&reg; Green-based RT2 Profiler assays sourced through Qiagen, Inc and TaqMan&reg; probe-based assays obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (and its subsidiaries).  USAMRIID has found that the TaqMan&reg; probe-based assays are essential: their background fluorescence and higher sensitivity are critical requirements to interpret and analyze data.  TaqMan Gene Expression Assays can only be sourced through ThermoFisher Scientific (doing business as Life Technologies) in order to maintain research data integrity and continuity with previous efforts.  At this time, sourcing real-time PCR assays from a different vendor that uses a different assay technology would negatively affect mission oriented deliverables as well as protocols for funded research efforts.</p>
<p>USAMRIID DSD also has DTRA-funded collaborative RDT&amp;E efforts with Duke University researchers, who have developed host-based human biomarker assays using inventoried or made-to-order TaqMan&reg; Gene Expression Assays sourced from ThermoFisher Scientific.  In order for DSD to transition these human-focused assays to USAMRIID and evaluate them using biodefense-relevant  non-human primate infection models, USAMRIID needs to use the same ThermoFisher product as our collaborators are using for their work in testing human patient cohorts.  An important deliverable to DTRA of this research effort is for USAMRIID DSD to ascertain the potential for direct portability of the collaborators' assays to our research.  Sourcing real-time PCR assays from a different vendor that may also use a different assay technology would not address the agreed upon deliverables of our funded research efforts.</p>

The authority for the sole source justification and other than full and open competition procedures will be FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) Only One Source Reasonably Available.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 334516.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor for this action is Carl Zeiss Microimaging. Carl Zeiss Microimaging is the sole manufacturer of a highly integrated microscope containing the Apotome technology, which has the ability to optically section biological samples. The Apotome technology, to which Carl Zeiss LLC holds an exclusive patent, is the only microscopy system that offers: 1) the ability to optically section biological samples, a feature not available on standard confocal microscopy systems; 2) built-in software that is compatible with existing microscopy systems in the laboratory; 3) it offers weight and dimensions which are compatible with the footprint of the end-user's BioSafety Level 3 area; and 4) internal field service engineers do not have access to BioSafety Level 3 areas to perform equipment maintenance on the Axio Imager; this issue is resolved because the equipment itself offers self-equipped scanning and built-in preventive maintenance programs.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source award is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided.  No request for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses shall be sent via electronic e-mail to the POC, Jeff Flook, at jeffrey.l.flook.civ@mail.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE, FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT TO HSQ TECHNOLOGY, A CORPORATION TO PROVIDE SERVICE SUPPORT FOR THE CUSTOM DESIGNED SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION (SCADA) SYSTEM SERVICES.
<p>The Department of Defense (DOD), Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition Directorate, (WHS/AD) intends to award a sole source contract under the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); and as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. WHS/AD intends to issue a follow-on contract to HSQ Technology, A Corporation in an effort entitled "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System Services." The anticipated period of performance will be for twelve (12) months. We anticipate awarding a contract to HSQ Technology, A Corporation to provide Operations and Maintenance on all associated hardware and software installed in the SCADA System as currently configured at RRMC, consisting of Servers, Work stations, Switches, Remote Terminal Units (RTU) and Field Devices at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex (RRMC), Adams County, PA.</p>
<p>The follow-on contract is necessary to continue current operations and maintenance service support for the SCADA System. Failure to issue a bridge contract would create an unacceptable, significant lapse in providing operations and maintenance services for a custom designed SCADA System acquired by the Government. The SCADA System manages multiple facility resource control and monitoring systems that interface with existing subsystems, such as power distributions, energy management, HVAC, escalators and elevators. To compete this requirement at this time would cost substantially more due to additional proposal preparation costs, a. This cost would not be overcome through competition. This notice of intent is NOT a request for proposals or quotations. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement via email in Microsoft Word format with a file size less than 5MB to: Marshall D. Edwards, Contract Specialist, via EMAIL: marshall.d.edwards6.civ@mail.mil <br />SUBJECT LINE: Response to NOI to Sole Source SCADA System Services<br />RESPONSE DATE/TIME: NO later than 5:00 pm Eastern on Tuesday, 6 September 2016.<br />All information submitted should support the offeror's capability to provide the services required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.

Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. The Government reserves the right to cancel the Sole Source Award.

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>Delivery Tickets/Packing Slip</p>
<p>Delivery Tickets/Packing Slip: All shipments must be accompanied with a <br />delivery ticket/packing slip. Delivery ticket/packing slip will be prepared<br />in duplicate by the contractor and must contain the following information: <br />(a) Name of supplier, <br />(b) Purchase Order (SF 1449) or Delivery Order Number (Federal Supply<br />Schedule/DD 1155) <br />(c) Date of Purchase Order or Delivery Order Number <br />(d) Itemized list of supplies furnished <br />(f) Quantity, unit price and extended prices of each item less applicable<br />discounts (unit prices and extended prices need not be shown when<br />incompatible with the use of automated systems, provided that the invoice is<br />itemized to show this information); and <br />(g) Date of delivery or shipment. The receiving activity designated Purchase<br />Order or Delivery Order Number must sign two copies of the delivery<br />ticket/packing slip. The signature of the designated receiving activity<br />constitutes acceptance by the Government. One ticket should be retained by<br />the receiving activity and one copy returned to the contractor or their<br />agent. The vendor or their agent should be notified that signed delivery<br />ticket/packing slip may be required, upon Government request, to support<br />their Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) invoice.</p>
<p><br />Warranty Information: Contractors/Vendors must provide warranty information for offered equipment, product(s), and/or services that will be used to determine "best value" offers. Standard manufacturer/ provider warranties are acceptable however differing warranties must be declared for each equipment, product, and/or services item(s) that differ from the standard manufacturer/provider warranty. Though this information will be collected and used as an evaluation factor in determining the "best value" offer it will be the responsibility of the Government (end-user/requiring activity) to coordinate with the contractor/vendor to ensure the specific repair/action being requested is covered under warranty at no-cost to the Government prior to the rendering of services/repairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Special Delivery Term: Your award has been marked for shipment to an<br />alternative Government delivery location to be repackaged due to shipment of<br />hazardous items, other similar reasons, or for shipment via a more economic<br />cost alternative (i.e. ship). Government ownership shall be deemed<br />occurred when the contractor delivers the goods to the alternative<br />Government delivery location therefore entitled to payment upon presentation<br />proof of delivery and packing slip(s) showing delivery was received at<br />destination (i.e. Tracy, CA). IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)<br />12.402(a) acceptance of a commercial item is based upon the assumption that<br />the Government will rely on the contractor's assurances that the commercial<br />item tendered for acceptance conforms to the contract requirements. The<br />Government inspection of commercial items will not prejudice its other<br />rights under the acceptance paragraph. Additionally, although the paragraph<br />does not address the issue of rejection, the Government always has the right<br />to refuse acceptance of nonconforming items found non-conforming outside of<br />damages caused by the Government either at the alternative Government<br />delivery location, during shipment to the final Government delivery<br />location, or at the final Government delivery location. Therefore, the<br />final iRAPT Acceptor shall process/accept contractor invoices submitted upon<br />receipt of proof of delivery and packing slip(s) using the delivery date<br />found on such documentation as both the iRAPT Receipt &amp; Acceptance dates.<br />Required agency delivery supporting documentation (i.e. circle, sign, and<br />date packing slip &amp; SF 1449/DD1155) shall be completed by the final<br />destination upon receipt of the shipment and filed accordingly along with<br />the contractor proof of delivery &amp; packing slip(s). The contracting officer<br />shall be the final decision authority regarding acceptable contractor<br />delivery supporting documentation at the alternative Government delivery<br />location.</p>

<p><strong>Note to the Proposed Contractor</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List</strong></p>
<p>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<DESC>This is a busy time of year, and we know we are not the only agency soliciting year-end requirements. We are also mindful of the fact that we have recently issued multiple solicitations for a variety of IT- and IT-security related needs. All this traffic can be confusing and overwhelming. It's easy to get lost in the noise.
<p>Still, and for reasons we cannot explain, we received no bids in response to our original solicitation to all eligible, Cisco-certified resellers/providers for replacement of our outdated core switch (see original issuing statement, below).</p>
<p>If your firm would like to pursue this opportunity, please review the attachments provided and submit your response to &lt;bfalk@ushmm.org&gt; via e-mail on or before 5 PM ET Wednesday, September 7, 2016.</p>
<p>Please note that we will engage with all communications we receive from eligible, responsible, Cisco-certified providers in this time frame. However, because this is a time-sensitive FY16 requirement, please note that we will give first preference to all responsive offers we receive by 5 PM ET Wednesday, September 7, 2016.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
*********************************************<br /><br />The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) is in need of replacing its outdated core switch.  The core switch is the central switch that is at the center of the hub-and-spoke network architecture that the Museum uses for day to day operations. This solicitation seeks to hire a Cisco Gold-certified or better partner(s) to source and/or perform an in-place upgrade to a fully-functioning core switch with redundant supervisor modules and multi-path iSCSI connectivity to SAN VLAN (the "New System").
<p>Museum contemplates issuing a single or multiple award(s) of a Firm Fixed Price contract(s) or order(s) resulting from this solicitation to accommodate sourcing of the equipment and its installation.</p>
<p>A Cisco point of contact has been included with this solicitation to confirm stated equipment requirements.</p>

<p>A ceiling increase is required to complete the network deprecation portion of the Enterprise IT Services Support Contract (EITSSC) order, during which six (one each for the Non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secret Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (SIPRNET)) supporting USSOUTHCOM's operations will be deprecated (collapsed onto) the Headquarters NIPRNET and SIPRNET.  The six networks being deprecated are those NIPRNET and SIPRNET networks currently dedicated to supporting:</p>
<p>The networks will be deprecated onto the existing Headquarters NIPRNET and SIPRNET networks, and the new centralized networks will be supported primarily from USSOUTHCOM Headquarters, in Miami, FL, reducing high costs associated with operating and maintaining eight, instead of two, networks.</p>
