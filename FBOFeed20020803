<DESC>The Federal Occupational Health Services (FOH) through the Division of Acquisition Management, Program Support Center, HHS, intends to modify Contract Number 232-01-0046 currently being performed by Compliant Corporation.  The purpose of this modification is to provide additional Automated External Defibrillator and CPR training Classes due to unforseen growth in the FOH AED program.   The Contract was awarded to provide a maximum of 125 classes per year for a basic period.  The Contract also includes two twelve month option periods.   We are currently in the basic year of the Contract and have held all 125 training classes and have an immediate need to provide approximately 220 additional classes before September 30, 2002.  This unforseen growth in the basic period also effects the optional periods.  For option periods one and two FOH anticipates needing a total of 1,000 classes over the original estimated total of 250.  Complient is the only source that can provide the Federal Occupational Health with the required amount of training before September 30, 2002 along with a complete training system that includes a single point of contact for FOH?s clients.  Coordination and delivery of on-site training that is integrated into an ASP-based software platform for comprehensive documentation of classes delivered by either Complient or obtained by FOH?s end-user client. Compliant?s unique capability to provide this internet accessible database for the storage and management of training information is complemented by their proprietary ownership as the one and only single centralized location with the ability to control, schedule and document training nationwide.   The proposed modification for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Capability statements demonstrating the ability to provide the services required will be reviewed.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available, therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this modification is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Office will proceed with award of the modification to Compliant Corporation.
