This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS,
submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>A provision of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, authorizes non competitive contracts to be performed by only one or a limited number of sources via 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1); Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) (A) and (B). As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) authority of Subpart 6.302-1, <em>Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements</em>, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District intends to execute, without competition, a bilateral Contract Modification under Contract W912P6-11-D-0004 (sole source, Modification P00017). The incumbent Contractor is KOKOSING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY/O'BRIEN &amp; GERE, JV; the address for this organization is 17531 Waterford Road, Fredericktown, Ohio 43019-9561, with Company Cage Code No. "6GS86."
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resulting modification will implement a new Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) with a realistic quantity of 7,000 tons of debris disposal, making it possible for uninterrupted dredging operations . The provisions of the CLIN will require that debris be separated from the dredged sediment, so that the sediment can be pumped with water into the Confined Disposal Facility of the Indiana Harbor Canal in East Chicago, Indiana.</p>
<p><br />A variety of debris is being encountered during dredging of the Indiana Harbor &amp; Canal (IHC) that requires disposal into a confined disposal facility (CDF). In the midst of the dredging operations, it has been determined that the quantity included in the solicitation, which resulted in the conformed contract bid schedule was substantially understated. Prior to dredging after contract award, the Harbor had not been dredged for over 40 years. Therefore there was no comparable data base for determining the debris to be expected at Indiana Harbor. Now that dredging has been performed under the Contact, contract records show that the debris is not uniformly distributed across the areas dredged to date and additional quantity must be disposed to ensure uninterrupted dredging operations of approximately 400,000 cubic yards. At this level of dredging quantity, records clearly show that the Contractor's rate of debris accumulation dictates approximately 7,000 tons of debris disposal.</p>
<p>KOKOSING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY/O'BRIEN &amp; GERE, JV, the incumbent Contractor possesses an extensive breadth of capabilities. It has designed and installed a unique dredging/offloading/debris disposal system consisting of multiple components and pieces of equipment, which took over a year to design, fabricate and install. Much of the equipment was fabricated and built just for the unique dredging and disposal requirements at IHC. It has done an excellent job improving and adjusting the system based on their experience throughout the first year of dredging. It is using the most effective and efficient crane and crane platform barge along with the required environmental bucket available to accomplish the dredging. The 3 barges to transport dredged material are specifically built for this project to maximize dredging and hauling times. The debris separation barge (DSB) is a state of the art piece of equipment that was specifically constructed for this project, with pumps sufficiently sized to pump sediment from the DSB to the CDF and provide adequate water coverage over the pumped sediment to avoid unacceptable air emissions. The screen used to separate sediment and debris from dredged material on the DSB has been tweaked and modified to optimize the separation process and avoid damage to pumps. The hydraulic excavator, the two front-end loaders and the container box with Government furnished crane utilized to accomplish the disposal of debris from the DSB into the CFD could not be more efficient.</p>
<p>One of the key tasks performed under this contract include the dredged material being transported by barge to the CDF where the debris must be separated from the dredged material so that the remaining sediment can be disposal hydraulically into the CDF. The debris collected during mechanical dredging activities and separated from the sediment must then be mechanically disposed of into the CDF. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have a separate contract to handle the disposal of only debris in excess of the tons provided in the original contract award. Therefore, this contractual requirement is only obtainable from a single source, the incumbent Contractor.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this notice is to publicize this contract action prior to contract modification, as mandated in FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and FAR Subpart 6.3 (Other Than Full and Open Competition). The contract type will remain Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and the period of performance will not be extended.</p>
<p>This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.
