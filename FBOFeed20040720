<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and Bureau of
Health Professions (BHPr) intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis to modify Contract No.: 250-03-0018, with National PACE Association (NPA) of Alexandria, Virginia.

The purpose of this modification is to expand the existing Workshops, Desk Review’s and On-Site Consultations.  Due to the overwhelming interest in the rural PACE Technical Assistance contract, the Government determined another workshop will allow additional organizations that were not able to attend the first two workshops to attend a third one.  The workshop will allow the organization to receive a market self assessment thus leading to a desk review and on-site consultation.
This modification to the current contract will allow NPA  to assess the nature of current and potential future partnerships of the now expanded interested rural providers with health professions training programs, including successful examples of collaboration and barriers to collaboration between rural providers who might participate in the PACE program and health professions training programs.  Because any other organization would have to duplicate the development of protocols for identifying the levels of varying needs of rural entities interested in PACE, NPA is the only responsible source capable of providing these services without substantial duplication of cost, which would not be expected to be recovered through competition and under the authority found in 41 USC 253(i), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). 
This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. 

Cite solicitation #04-N250-5037 HA when corresponding.  

WE WILL RESPOND TO WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE ONLY.

<SUBJECT>61--Rapidly Deployable Emergency Spare Transformers
<SOLNBR>DE-RP26-04NT42193
<CONTACT>Raymond Jarr, Contracting Officer, 304-285-4242, lisa.kuzniar@netl.doe.gov;Lisa Kuzniar, Contract Specialist, 304-285-4242, lisa.kuzniar@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to issue a competitive solicitation, No. DE-RP26-04NT42193, entitled ?Rapidly Deployable Emergency Spare Transformers.?  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335311 with a size standard of 750 employees.  The solicitation will be available for downloading on the DOE Interactive Industry Procurement System (IIPS) located at: http://e-center.doe.gov on or about September 1, 2004.  If you need technical assistance in registering with IIPS, downloading the solicitation, or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk at IIPS-HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. The goal of this project is to procure, store, and make preparations for the deployment of EHV transformers, of two different voltage ratings, whose design is appropriate to replace damaged EHV transformers at substations on the electrical grid if the need should arise.  This project seeks to procure three single-phase autotransformers with a nominal 500/230 kV rating and six single-phase autotransformers with a nominal rating of 345/138 kV.  The power rating of each single-phase transformer will be 200 MVA and will be used to form three phase transformer banks rated at 600 MVA. The salient characteristic of the Rapidly Deployable Emergency Spare Transformer concept is to provide a transformer that can be stored on a long-term basis at selected storage sites with a minimal amount of equipment monitoring and maintenance to be kept ?ready ?to ?use? so that they can be deployed from the storage site to a utility substation via 60 ton low-boy trailers on the nation?s highway system, and that can be deployed rapidly; i.e., approximately 96 hours (this assumes no more than a 300 mile transport from the storage site to the utility substation) from the time of decision to deploy until the transformer is connected to the grid at the utility substation and is energized.  The transformer design must also be compatible with the existing infrastructure of the nation?s electrical substations in terms of its flexibility to be physically installed in a wide range of substation layouts and within various available substation ?footprints?.  Once in service, they should also be readily operable and maintainable by personnel responsible for the substation without substantial additional training. The Scope of Work includes three major tasks: first to define the specific transformer performance characteristics necessary to be compatible replacement units for a high percentage of the transformers at that voltage rating at designated regional substations of interest; second, the design and manufacture of the transformers; and third to define and develop portions of the logistical support mechanisms necessary for the long term storage and the rapid deployment of the transformers.  Rapid deployment of the transformers includes transport from its storage location to the utility substation, installation, testing and operation.  To achieve the rapid deployment mission it is anticipated that the transformer design characteristics, including those that affect the long term storage and a minimum of field assembly of these transformers, may need to differ significantly from, and possibly require a unique design, compared to manufacturer?s existing transformer designs.  However, the transformer design should be based on proven design methodologies, technologies and materials and should not be experimental in nature.  A high reliability for these transformers is an important requirement. Questions/comments relating to this solicitation shall be submitted electronically through the ?Submit Question? feature of the IIPS at http://e-center.doe.gov.  All responses to solicitation questions will be released on the IIPS Internet page.  The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS; no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be available.  Telephone request, written request, or facsimile request for a copy of the solicitation package will not be accepted and/or honored.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a new geothermal power plant for MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas Company.

This project will develop plans for the development of a geothermal power plant, and will serve as a blueprint for other MOL-owned wells capable of geothermal production.  

Fully aware of the commercial potential held within its hydrocarbon wells, MOL has developed a program to evaluate the economic benefits of entering the geothermal business.  MOL envisions that a successful entry into the marketplace would make geothermal energy a core product among its suite of offerings.  This would also mean that MOL would qualify for greenhouse gas emission credits within Hungary.  An important aspect of MOL’s geothermal program is the development of a geothermal plant with which to kick-start the company’s entry into the marketplace.

In addition to generating a new source of electricity for the region, the new plant would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing a portion of fossil fuel generated electricity with that of geothermal generated electricity.  This project would also assist MOL in complying with European Union (EU) Directives for air pollution.  

Hungary is committed under EU agreements to increase the use of renewable energy by 59% by 2010, and is obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by four million tons annually.  Important companies such as MOL must reduce their emissions through allocated targets or else face stiff penalties, including large fines.  Geothermal energy is one area where MOL can achieve these targets and do so in a manner that would create additional revenues, while still contributing to economic development in the region in an environmentally safe manner.  The success of this plant would likely spur MOL to consider identical facilities at numerous other sites throughout Hungary.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $167,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, September 6, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to issue a purchase order for the following items:  Bullard Cool Vest, Isotherm 2, Qty: 105.  Specifications for the Bullard Cool Vest (Isotherm 2)
Cooling vest to be worn over personal protective equipment to allow emergency responders to work for longer periods in high heat.  Shall use phase change technologies, not gels or ice packs, design shall be centered on maintaining a temperature of 55 degrees F, shall provide two hours cooling at 90 Degrees F, device shall use an easily adjustable mesh vest made to fit from medium to large sizes, shall be capable of completely recharging cooling ability in 20 minutes, shall be constructed of a flame retardant material, vest must be lightweight (less than 7 LBS), vest must not produce condensation during wear, and interchangeable cooling system with Front and back replaceable inserts.  Line item # 2:  Isothern replacement packs.  Qty:  105 Specifications for the Isotherm replacement packs:  
No waiting.  No down time.  Keep extra cool packs ready for instant on-site changes; made of specially engineered plastic, Isotherm packs designed to expand up to 400% without damage.

Cool packs may be re-energized thousands of times providing hours of safe, controlled body temperature management.  Placed in a cooler of ice water, the cool packs will fully recharge in approximately 20 minutes.  However, ice water is not necessary as the phase change technology actually begins recharging the packs whenever they are placed in an environment that is cooler than 55 degrees F.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with RMA (the incumbent contractor).  The period of performance will be one year with four option years.  

The purpose is to maintain consistency in credit risk diagnostic tests taken by OCC's bank examiners.  As part of the new curriculum development process, the OCC determined that it was imperative to obtain a baseline measure of the bank examiner's credit skill level.  This was accomplished in the present contract with RMA.  The RMA credit risk diagnostic identified examiner credit skill levels and also measured progress in enhancing those skills as the new credit curriculum was implemented.  

Because diagnostics are structured differently (e.g., different key categories, different questions), all of the work to-date in establishing a baseline and using it to craft the new credit curriculum would be lost if we were to change contractors, thus changing diagnostics. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation document is available. 

If you have any questions, please email them to thora.stanwood@occ.treas.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Weather Service (NWS) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with INH Technologies in Bendbrook, TX to purchase 100 Remote Off-Air Monitor System (ROAMS) RF Transmitter Monitors. These ROAMS have been developed by INH Technology and are designed to assist in determining problems that may occur at NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitter sites, both local and remote. When installed at a transmitter site, the ROAMS monitors the status of several key operational parameters of the transmitter system at the site. When it detects an error or fault condition in the monitored parameters it reports that condition by placing a telephone call to a designated location. ROAMS also is used by the Console Replacement System (CRS) to capture NWR specific area message encoder messages for validation purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested companies may submit a written capability statement listing data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a system capable of meeting the previously cited requirements.  This must be received by the Government within 15 days from the posting of this notice. A determination not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the Government’s discretion. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification made to request for proposal DOL049RP00054 for Information Technology Facility Support, Programming, and Repair Services released on July 19, 2004.  The entire procurement announcement and this modification are viewable in the Federal Business Opportunities website.  The procurement is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS 541519, size standard $21 million.  Due to DOL requirements, participation in the procurement is restricted to sources falling under the set-aside provisions which have existing management and performance in both the Salt Lake basin and Washington, DC metropolitan area.  Due to possible differences in file formats between Windows NT versus Windows XP, this modification provides what is hopefully a clean version (without visible edits of draft versoins) of the Statement of Work when viewed under Windows XP.  There are no other changes to the previous notice including the proposal due time and date.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 04: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the due-date for submission of BPA responses. In order to be considered for the first task order, vendors must submit a response as required by the date due as originally published. These responses will be the only ones evaluated for award of the first task order and BPAs.  Vendors are not precluded from submitted a response to the BPA only (without a quote for the first task order) after the due date. However, there is not guarantee if and when these late responses will be considered.


ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements with venders capable of providing short-term, project-based specific scientific and technical support.  During government fiscal year 2003, NOAA’s headquarters acquisition office acquired over $92 million worth of supplies and services to support the mission of the Ocean Service, Marine Fisheries Service, and Research Office.  Approximately 70% of the 1,200 transactions issued in 2003 were simplified acquisitions for services and supplies that directly support NOAA programs.  A portion of these simplified acquisitions were individual agreements for short-term (i.e., 6-12 months) technical and scientific services that required specialized skills to address a diverse range of projects that support programs and NOAA’s overall mission.  The type of projects include services to collect and analyze scientific data, creating, reviewing and revising scientific and technical plans and reports, reviewing program plans, procedures and results for compliance with pre-stated goals, building and sustaining coalitions among scientific and technical experts, implementing program plans, providing litigation support, and coordinating program/project actions among Federal, state and local governments as well as industry and citizen groups.  The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and scientific knowledge combined with detailed knowledge of NOAA’s mission, objectives and line office operating plans.  The following is a partial list of the types of labor that have previously been sought to work on short term projects:  physical oceanographer, coastal scientist, oceanographer, marine biologist, marine ecologist, environmental scientist, fishery biologist, and natural resource economist.   The level of experience can vary from junior level (graduate students) to principals and senior scientists.  NOAA’s mission, line offices and program objectives can be reviewed on its webpage: www.noaa.gov. 

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to create a more efficient process for acquiring and managing the scientific and technical support services described above, NOAA is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements to small businesses holding MOBIS Contracts (SIN 874) under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  The first task order to be placed against the BPA is also included with this announcement.  

Small businesses holding GSA MOBIS schedule contracts (SIN 874) who are interested in being considered for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the services described above should review the attached documents.  These documents include:  (1) A detailed Request For Quotation (RFQ-07_08_04); the prospective Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA 07_09_2004); and the first task order (BPA Task Order 0001).

<DESC>The Department of Air Force is seeking qualified entities for a Military Housing Privatization project for Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Group I (Altus AFB OK, Luke AFB AZ, Sheppard AFB TX and Tyndall AFB FL). This project involves a real estate transaction to privatize all of the military family housing at these four bases into one initiative.  The Government will lease approximately 1370 acres of land at the four bases for 50 years and convey 3793 existing housing units and other improvements to one successful offeror.  The successful offeror will own and operate the rental housing development of 2875 homes at the four bases for military families for 50 years, as well as finance, plan, design, and construct improvements in the development.  

A Financial Forum for commercial Lenders will be conducted at the Hilton Dallas Lincoln Center in Dallas TX on Wednesday, 1 September 2004, from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm.  This forum will include general briefings on the Air Education and Training Command One-step Request for Proposal and their base grouping methodology.  The objective of the Financial Forum is to convey pertinent information on the project and to gain insight into the Financial Lender’s position on how to improve the project financially.  Individual sessions will be scheduled during the forum for Lenders to ask pertinent questions for each base and the concept as a whole and to provide their ideas on how this project could be financed.  A separate Developer’s Industry Forum will be held at a later date and will be announced separately.  For additional information and to register for this Lender’s forum, please visit http://www.pscmhc.com.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information for planning purposes on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of an air to ground missile system similar to the AGM-114 Hellfire or Brimstone-class designed for fighter/attack jets.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is conducting an initiative to evaluate the concept of using numerous, light (<150lbs), lethal missiles for engaging a wide range of moving and stationary surface targets from conventional USAF fighter and attack jets.  Preliminary modeling and simulation results from this initiative indicate a variety of operational advantages may be offered by this concept.  The envisioned system should utilize either proven semi-active laser homing or active seeker technology to provide precise guidance either from the employing aircraft or off-board designators.  In addition, the envisioned standoff range would be at least equal or better than current AGM-114 launch from medium altitudes.  Target sets and current technology suggest blast/fragmentation, thermo baric, and shaped charge are the desired range of warhead options.  High weapons load out, low collateral damage potential, and simplified maintenance are some of the other envisioned benefits from this class of weapon.  The AEFB is primarily interested in -Off-The-Shelf products that could be adapted for this purpose.

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN_19 August 2004_ to Major. Patrick Sullivan, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Major Sullivan can be reached at (208) 828-3511.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for the envisioned effort.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<SUBJECT>A -- UTILIZATION OF AN ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING DRUG IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN MEN WITH LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTABLE TO BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA
<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the Office of Dietary Supplements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug and matching placebo for use in a National Institutes of Health sponsored multi-center clinical trial in men with lower urinary tract symptoms attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

INTRODUCTION:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the Office of Dietary Supplements is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate if treatment with  Serenoa repens or Pygeum africanum or an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent serving as an active control delays or prevents the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to placebo.  Treatment will be administered in a double-blind fashion.  The trial is known as the Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Urological Symptoms (CAMUS).  The four-arm trial will enroll approximately 2,800 men over a period of two years.  The following centers will be enrolling study participants:  Northwestern University, Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada), Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, Washington University, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the University of Colorado, Yale University, New York University, Columbia University and the University of Maryland.  Central data collection and analysis will be performed by the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.

STUDY GOALS:  The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if treatment with Serenoa repens or Pygeum africanum or an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent selected as the active control will delay or prevent the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to placebo.  The treatment period will range from four to six years.  The primary outcome is the time to clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia defined as one of the following:  an increase from baseline in the American Urological Association symptom score index of 4 or more points confirmed at the next scheduled study visit, acute urinary retention, recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections or urosepsis, new incontinence or progression of minor incontinence, and initiation of active, unblinded therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia, including phytotherapy, alpha-adrenergic blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or any invasive therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  The protocol for this trial has been approved by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board established by the NIDDK.  It is anticipated that recruitment of study participants for this trial will begin in spring 2005. The Collaborator providing the alpha-adrenergic blocking drug will be expected to provide drug without charge for the expected 4-6 year treatment period for approximately 2,800 participants.  The Collaborator will also provide sufficient matching placebo without charge.  It is also expected that Collaborator will ship drug and placebo to a NIH-supported Drug Distribution Center free of charge.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:   A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  Capability Statements related to treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should address the following criteria:  timeline for ability to provide drug and placebo after selection of Collaborator is determined, approved daily dose of drug, previous studies of efficacy of drug in treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia and known side-effects of drug.  Statements may not exceed 10 pages.

TERMS:  The collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at 
http://techdev.niddk.nih./forms.htm.  No funding from the government is available.

SUBMISSION DATES:   A written statement of interest must be submitted by August 4, 2004 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by August 19, 2004.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and proposals are hereby being requested.  Solicitation NIH-AG-260-04-09 is a Request for Proposal. This requirement is a re-competition of contract no. N01-AG-0-2103 with BioReliance, Inc. The duration of the proposed firm fixed contract is one year with four (04) successive one year option periods. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisitions Circulars’s (FACs) 97-03 and 97-04.  This is an unrestricted acquisition and not set aside for small businesses. SECTION C: The objective of this project is to provide an independent surveillance of the health status of rodents maintained in contractor facilities for the aged rodent colonies. The evaluation to be performed will include gross pathology, histopathology, microbiology, parasitology and serology.  The Project Office will select animals from the colonies in a manner which samples the range of strains, ages and holding rooms that characterize the colonies. The number of animals to be tested each year is dependent on the number of contract colonies in operation each year.  There are five colonies to be covered by this contract: the Fisher 344 rat colony; the multi-genotypic mouse colony; the caloric-restricted colony (rat and mouse); the hybrid rat colony; and the new mutant mouse aging colony when it is established.  Each rodent colony contract is a nine-year contract with the renewal contract for each colony beginning in year 7 of the original contract, with a 3 year overlap of the contracts to ensure constant supply of animals.  The first year of the rodent colony contracts is devoted to re-derivation of strains, so there are no animals to be tested in that year.  Years 2 through 9 represent the build-up and maintenance of the active colonies, when health monitoring is performed regularly.  Eighty percent of the animals will be evaluated with the basic profile, and 20% of the animals will be evaluated with the comprehensive profile. Specifically, the contractor shall perform clinical evaluation of mice and rats selected by the Project Officer from the NIA colonies and shipped (at no cost to the contractor) on a quarterly basis.  Total numbers of rats anticipated on an annual basis 280, 330, 360, 240, 180 and total number of mice on an annual basis 160, 300, 240, 180, 180 for years 1 through 5 respectively.  No more than 30 animals will be shipped in any one week.  Animals will be identified as to which barrier and room from which they were shipped. In the event of an apparent outbreak of disease, or serious question regarding the health status of a group of animals, the contractor shall immediately contact the Project Officer by telephone and follow-up with written notification.  This schedule may be altered after consultation between the Project Officer, the NIH Contracting Officer, and the Contractor  in such an event.  Upon receipt of animals from the Colony Contractor, the Contractor shall divide each quarterly shipment of animals from each contract into two (2) groups.  One group consisting of 80% of the animals and representing each barrier and room will be tested for agents listed below under Basic Profile.  The other 20% of animals will be tested for the agents listed under the Comprehensive profile.  Specifically, the contractor shall: 1) Describe general conditions of all animals, weight, and any visible lesions or symptoms, 2) Conduct a gross pathology examination on all animals using procedures that will maximize the chance for detection of the agents listed below, c) Eighty percent of the animals will be evaluated with the Basic Profile (below) and the other 20% will be evaluated with the Comprehensive Profile, which includes the Basic Profile plus additional tests listed under Comprehensive Profile.  All tests are applied to both rats and mice unless indicated specific to either rats (R) or mice (M). BASIC PROFILE: Viruses-MHV (M), Ectromelia virus (M), Mouse parvovirus(es) (M), Theiler’s (M), PVM, LCMV (M), Rotavirus (M), Sendai, Rat Parvoviruses (R), Rate Coronovirus (R); Microbiology- Mycoplasma pulmonis, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii (4280), Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella enteritidis; Parasitology - Spironucleus muris, Giardia sp., Cryptosporidium sp., Syphacia sp., Hymenolepis sp., Mites; Histopathology- GI tract, Small intestine, Cecum, Colon, Respiratory tract: Nasal passages, Middle ears, Lungs, Trachea Liver.

Disposal of Tissue/Slides: a)Excess tissue can be disposed of upon completion of the analysis.  Slides and embedded tissue blocks are to be archived for a period of 5 years, after which they may be discarded unless otherwise specified by the Project Officer and b) The contractor must be prepared to accept delivery of archived slides and tissue blocks from the current contract with BioReliance, Inc. and store them for the remainder of the five year archival period. SECTION D: All deliverables required under this contract shall be packaged, marked and shipped in accordance with Government specifications.  The Contractor shall guarantee that all required materials shall be delivered in immediate usable and acceptable condition.  SECTION E: INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE - The deliverables shall be inspected and accepted at destination by the NIH Project Officer.  SECTION F: REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES - The following reports and deliverables are required: 1) The data generated from these evaluations will be gross pathology, histopathology, microbiology, Parasitology, and serology data on each individual animal submitted for evaluation.  Data shall be collected on forms supplied by the Contractor in a format approved by the Project Officer.

The final report shall consist of the work performed and results obtained for the entire contract period of performance.  The Contractor shall submit, with the final report, a summary of salient results achieved during the performance of the contract.  The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation: FAR 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS; FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this solicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The proposals received in response to this RFP will be reviewed by an ad hoc review group established by the NIA Scientific Review Office. The following factors, listed in order of relative importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:  I. Experience: (60 points)Documented evidence of experience in pathological, microbiological and serological assessment of health status of mice and rats, with specific experience in tests required in the scope of this work.  Evidence of knowledge specific to pathological assessment and health status of aged mice and rats.  Specific evidence (e.g. publication, training, prior experience) specific to aged rodents should be provided. II. Facilities: (20 points) Suitability of facilities for short-term maintenance of animals to be evaluated prior to evaluation.  Must detail effective system to protect these animals from contamination by other animals passing through facility.  Must demonstrate competence in laboratory quality control through such measures as: copies of lab protocols, quality control procedures, lists of reference reagents, and history of reliability. III. Awareness: (20 points)A demonstrated awareness of diseases, degenerative problems, and other conditions likely to be observed in the conduct of this project and the significance of these observation to the general health status of the colonies being monitored. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR  An evaluation of offeror's past performance information will be conducted subsequent to the technical evaluation.  However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal would not be selected for award based on the results of the evaluation of factors other than past performance. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. 
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.  
When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of past performance information:+2Excellent - Based on the offeror's performance record, no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again.+1Good - Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Sources of information state that the offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would do business with the offeror again. 0None - No past performance history identifiable.-1	Marginal - Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Sources of information make unfavorable reports about the offeror's performance and express concern about doing business with the offeror again.
-2	Poor - Based on the offeror's performance record, serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Sources of information consistently stated that the offeror's performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the offeror again.  EVALUATION OF SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION-SDB participation will not be scored, but the Government’s conclusions about overall commitment and realism of the offeror’s SDB Participation targets will be used in determining the relative merits of the offeror’s proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered to offer the best value to the Government. The extent of the offeror’s Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Targets will be evaluated before determination of the competitive range.  Evaluation of SDB participation will be assessed based on consideration of the information presented in the offeror’s proposal. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform. Offers will be evaluated on the following sub-factors: (a)Extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified.(b)	Complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform.(c)Realism of the proposal.(d)Extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition. PRICE: Price is to be proposed on a cost per animal basis.  The technical proposal shall receive paramount consideration in making an award under this solicitation; offeror must include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with its offer; FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS; FAR52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition with the following additional clauses: 52.203-6 RESTRICTIONS ON SUBCONTRACTOR SALES TO THE GOVERNMENT with ALTERNATE I, 52.203-10 PRICE OR FEE ADJUSTMENT FOR ILLEGAL OR IMPROPER ACTIVITY, 52.219-8 UTILIZATION OF SMALL, SMALL DISADVANTAGED AND WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS, 52.219-14 LIMITATION ON SUBCONTRACTING, 52.222-26 EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, 52.222-35 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR SPECIAL DISABLED AND VIETNAM ERA VETERANS, 52.222-36 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR HANDICAPPED WORKERS, 52.222-37 EMPLOYMENT REPORTS ON SPECIAL DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM ERA, and 52.225-3 BUY AMERICAN ACT.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-04-238, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-16.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339111 and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to purchase console upgrades for five Bruker DMX NMR spectrometers: (1) 750 MHz Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer – serial no. BH077195; (2) 600 MHz Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer – serial no. BH071294; (3) 600 MHz Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer – serial no. BH071194; (4) 500 MHz Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer – serial no. BH077295; and (5) 500 MHz Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer – serial no. BH059393. The five Bruker DMX NMR spectrometers were purchased from Bruker Biospin Corporation, 15 Fortune Drive, Manning Park, Billerica, MA 01821.  
 
The Mandatory Technical Specifications are as follows:

	• All specifications must be demonstrated on site.
•	Delivery shall be scheduled to coincide with the installation of the Bruker 900 MHz spectrometer on the NIH Bethesda campus (Building 6) in July 2006. 
•	The console upgrades delivered in July 2006 shall correspond to new 2006 consoles incorporating all board levels and upgrades available at that time (i.e. July 2006).
 

1.	The spectrometer software and operation for all five consoles shall be fully compatible with other Avance NMR spectrometers in NIDDK.
 
2.	Each spectrometer must provide a minimum of five frequency channels together with the capability of producing different asynchronous or synchronous composite pulse decoupling and different shaped pulses on all five of these channels simultaneously and independently. The composite pulse decoupling schemes must be freely programmable by the user and include the option for pulse shaping of the individual elements of the composite pulses. All five channels shall have identical specifications at low rf power levels, except that only two channels require operation over the frequency range for 19H and 1H, and a minimum of three channels shall operate over the frequency range for all other nuclei.
	
3.   	Each system shall be equipped with hardware and software for mapping the magnetic field profile within the sample in three orthogonal dimensions on regular triple resonance probes and in the z-direction on the cryogenic probes, and software for making the required homogeneity adjustments under computer control.  The spectrometer also shall include the capability to automatically adjust the homogeneity of the magnetic field during the course of multi-hour experiments that include pulsed field gradients, without interruption of the actual experiments or having any other noticeable effect on the acquisition process.

4.	The console electronics for all 5 systems shall be capable of 0.5 degrees phase resolution, 0.1 Hz frequency resolution and a 90 dB attenuation range on all five channels. The RF phase shall vary by no more than 3o over an attenuation range of 50 dB from full power. Rectangular pulses generated with the pulse shaping unit shall have phases and power levels indistinguishable from regular pulses specified to be at the same numerical attenuation setting.
 
5.  	The console for all 5 systems shall be able to pulse and observe 2H nuclei without physically recabling the console.

6.   The long-term pulse amplitude stability on all channels for all 5 systems shall be better than +/-1% and phase stability shall be better than +/-1o as measured over a 24 h period in a room where the temperature changes by less than 1.5 oC.  This stability is measured from the relative difference between 1D spectra, recorded with a 30o flip angle pulse, at various times during a 24 h period. 

7. 	The console electronics for all 5 systems shall permit application of user defined shaped pulses to operate independently on each of the five available channels. The shaped pulses must allow a minimum of 16000 user-definable elements within a single pulse shape. The dynamic range of each channel for shaped pulses must be at least 80 dB total range, with 0.1 dB resolution.

8. 	Each system shall be capable of independent and simultaneous control over amplitude, frequency, phase and duration of pulses for all five frequency channels and over internal real-time clock pulses for triggering of external devices. 

9.    The console for each system shall be equipped with a digitizer of at least 16 bits allowing simultaneous sampling of the quadrature receiver channels for spectral widths of up to at least 1 MHz. The system shall also be capable of oversampling and digital filtering of the NMR audio   signal. In addition, no DC offset correction in the time domain shall be required on data acquired with a single scan, independent of receiver gain setting.

10. 	Each console shall provide access to at least 8 TTL lines that can be addressed by the pulse program for external device control, and are not dedicated to other spectrometer functions.

11. 	Each system shall be equipped with a pulse program controlled pulsed field gradient power supply, capable of generating a field gradient along the z axis with a strength of at least 50 G/cm and at least 45 G/cm in the x and y directions, for the 5 mm probeheads.  The recovery of the magnetic field and its homogeneity shall be such that a signal acquired 200 us after a rectangular 1 ms gradient applied simultaneously in the x, y, and z directions at 25 G/cm in each direction, (z direction only for cryogenic probeheads) differs by less than 3% from that acquired without the preceding gradient pulse.  This shall be measured for a sample of 2 mM sucrose in D2O solution, using 1 Hz exponential line broadening and identical  phasing by direct subtraction of the spectra acquired with and without gradients.

12.	Before high-power amplification, pulse rise and fall times shall be <50 ns, measured between 10% and 90% amplitude levels.  Fast power switching (less than 500 ns) on each system shall be provided on all five of the channels, regardless whether the preceding pulse is shaped or rectangular.

14.	Each system shall be equipped with a variable temperature control unit capable of providing less than 0.01oC sample temperature variation per 1oC room temperature change. The sample temperature control, using the pulsed field gradient triple resonance 5-mm probehead must operate over a range of 5oC to 60 oC with setting and control being independent of room temperature, without the requirement of external cooling substances such as liquid nitrogen or dry ice, on both regular and cryogenic probeheads.  The system shall be capable of operating in the variable temperature mode using dried air (with a dewpoint of –70 F and pressure, 80 psi, 3 cfm) and meet all the above listed performance specifications. The sample temperature shall be adjustable in 0.1oC increments.

19.	The experimental excitation profile of a 1-ms G3 shaped pulse, generated by the pulse shaping unit on each system shall be within a factor of 1.5 of the theoretical profile, over an offset range of at least +/-10 kHz on both 1H and 13C channels. 

20.	Each system shall be equipped with a SCSI interface for control of up to at least 8 external devices.

21.	Each system shall have the capability of processing and analyzing data from a previous experiment while simultaneously acquiring data for a new experiment. This shall hold true for both one- and multi-dimensional experiments, up to four dimensions.

22.	The host computer system shall operate under the LINUX operating system and provide standard utilities, TCP/IP network tools, and availability of a C compiler. Additional copies of the NMR acquisition and processing software shall be provided to ensure that all spectrometers make use of the same software, corresponding to the most up to date version of the software produced by the vendor.

23.	For all 5 spectrometers, the vendor shall take full responsibility for the entire system.

Besides demonstrating that the above listed requirements are met, each system shall be able to conduct the following tests successfully after installation in the buyer’s laboratory on both the cryogenic and room temperature probes (all tests shall be conducted at 25 oC, while operating in the temperature controlled mode):
(A) The largest intensity observed in any of 10 consecutive 1H-13C spin-echo difference spectra (total of 2 transients per difference experiment) for the anomeric proton at 5.4 ppm in a sample containing 10 mg sucrose in 0.25 ml D2O, in a Shigemi thin-wall sample cell, using the following pulse sequence:

		1H       90x   - 3 msec -         180x           - 3 msec -  Acquire
		13C                               90x           90+/-x

	shall be smaller than 1% of the corresponding intensity observed in a single transient spectrum.  The S/N for the anomeric resonances in the difference spectrum shall be >80:1 for the room temperature probes, and >200:1 for the cryogenic probes.
Parameters: 25 oC, SW = 10 kHz, exponential line broadening 1 Hz, 13C transmitter at 100 ppm, non-spinning, full power 13C pulses, 4 dummy scans, acquire a total of 2 scans, acquisition time 1.5 sec (16K complex points, repetition rate 2.5 sec (including the acquisition time).
(B) For the same sample, the recovery after a rectangular 1-ms 25 Gauss/cm simultaneous x/y/z pulsed field gradient (1-ms z gradient for cryogenic probes) shall be such that a 1D spectrum (10 kHz spectral width, 1.64 s acquisition time, 1 Hz line broadening, single transient) recorded 200 microseconds after the end of the gradient pulse shall differ by less than 5% from a spectrum recorded in the absence of this gradient pulse (using identical phasing and processing parameters).  

25.	In the case of each system, the upgraded console shall meet or exceed the best S/N and lineshape performances on both room temperature and cryogenic probes achieved by each system immediately prior to the upgrades. S/N shall be measured on two samples: ASTM 0.1% ethylbenzene; 0.5 mg sucrose/ml in D2O.

26.	Any glitch levels shall fall below the S/N threshold for each system on both room temperature and cryogenic probes, for direct observation of 1H, 13C or 31P, in the presence of simultaneous moderate power levels broad-band decoupling 13C (5 kHz RF), 15N (1 kHz RF) and 31P (1 kHz RF; only for 600 MHz systems equipped with QXP probe) on the not-observed channel.

27.    For each system the spectrometer console and all electronics shall be covered under full parts and labor hardware and software warranty for a period of one year and a full parts warranty for an additional period of four years starting from the date that all guaranteed specifications resulting from this contract have been met in the buyer's laboratory.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires full software support for the Hewlett Packard (formally Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)) VAX and Alpha systems and its backup site.  I.  SOFTWARE SUPPORT:  A.  The Government requires the Contractor to provide the following specific levels of support:  A.1) The Contractor shall support all software components and functional features of these items.  This support shall include troubleshooting and problem solution of current software products.  Also, the Government requires that the Contractor make available any "patches" and future software updates and releases and supporting documentation as provided by the original manufacturer over the life of the contract. The Contractor shall demonstrate ability to meet this requirement by showing evidence of agreement with manufacturer or other means of accomplishing the upgrades in such a manner as to be legally and technically acceptable to the original manufacturer. The Contractor shall establish a point of contact where the Government may place trouble calls regarding software.  A qualified respondent shall initiate a reply after receipt of the Government's trouble call; A.2) Software updates shall include documentation, corrections, updates, enhancements and the right under this contract to successor products.  Successor products, i.e., new software level releases, if accepted by the Government, will be provided at no additional charge; A.3) Software shall be provided in the same code format as other software provided hereunder with the same rights in data applicable thereto; and A.4) In case of new software level releases, the Government may elect to accept the later version of the software, and if accepted, software support will be provided at no additional cost and no additional charge.  Any reprogramming or additional equipment required to accommodate such later versions will be at the Government's expense.  If the Government elects not to accept such later versions, the Contractor shall continue to correct any latent defects of software supplied under this contract. Such obligations to correct latent defects shall be limited to that necessary to permit the Government to process its normal workload.  B.  The Government also requires the Contractor to provide the following support:  B.1) Response Time - It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide a level of support necessary to ensure that system problems do not cause downtime.  Accordingly, the Government established a requirement that from the time the Government notifies the Contractor that a system problem exists, the Contractor shall respond within four (4) hours.  Within this response time interval, the Contractor may initially (so as to reduce system downtime) telephonically respond directly to on-site government personnel with appropriate instructions, which may return the system to full operation; B.2) All services rendered under this contract will be performed by competent personnel, experienced and qualified on the software listed for the base year clins and the option years; B.3) Point of Contact -The Contractor shall provide the Government with the telephone number of a primary point of contact for on-call service 24 hours per day, 7 days per week; B.4)  Response Time Credit -The Contractor shall grant to the Government a credit in the amount of 1 % of the total monthly support charge for each hour of delay, beginning with the time of notification plus permitted response time, and ending with the actual completion time.  In no event will the total credit exceed the total dollar value of the monthly support charges for Clins/Subclins. II. OPERATING SOFTWARE ALTERNATE I:  Operating system software refers to those routines that interface directly with hardware, peripheral devices, the computer operations, and applications and utility programs.  III.  DISCONTINUATION OF SOFTWARE SUPPORT:  The Government may discontinue any support on any item covered under the terms of this contract by giving the Contractor 30 days written notice prior to the date of discontinuation.  If service is discontinued under this clause, the Contractor shall be entitled only to payment for services rendered prior to the effective date of discontinuation. There shall be no additional discontinuation costs due the Contractor for discontinuations effected under this clause.  IV.  REQUIRED STANDARD WORKMANSHIP:  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the quality of all services rendered hereunder shall conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade or field of endeavor.  All services shall be rendered by or supervised directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade or field, and holding any licenses required by law. V. MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR:  The Contractor shall provide all necessary maintenance services as specified herein at the prices shown for the Clins (Option Years included) and shall keep the equipment in good operating condition.  Fully trained and competent maintenance personnel in accordance with the contract and the statement of work will provide maintenance coverage.  “Fully trained” is defined as capable of performing required maintenance without trial and error, or in effect, without learning on the job at the expense of this contract.  In no case shall the Government be obligated to pay for trainee cost(s), nor does the arrival of a trainee meet response time or any other requirements of this contract.  Personnel who are “in training” will not be utilized except as observers and helpers to qualified personnel.  If during the performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer questions the adequacy of the qualifications of personnel assigned to this contract, the Contractor shall have the burden of proving the personnel meet requirements.  VI:  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY:  The information technology (IT) being acquired under this solicitation/contract shall accurately process date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing, and sequencing) form, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000 and leap year calculations, to the extent that other information technology, used in combination with the information technology being acquired, properly exchanges date/time data with it.  All non-compliant IT must be upgraded to be year 2000 compliant prior to the earlier of either December 31, 1999 or the earliest date on which the IT may be required to perform date/time processing involving dates later than December 31, 1999.  VII:  PERIOD OF CONTRACT:  Any contract awarded as a result of an offer submitted in response to this solicitation shall be effective from the date of contract award and shall continue for a base period and four (4) one year options, unless sooner terminated under the terms of this contract.

<DESC>Amendment #1 Questions and Government Responses Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Announcement: PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared under FAR Part 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this request. Questions and Government Responses: You will find the solicitation RFQ 35858 documents and questions and the government's response on the following website:  http://govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp Or below: Due Date: Technical and Cost proposal are due via email no later than Friday, July 23, 2004, 2pm Eastern Standard Time to: robin.doyle@mms.gov.  No phone calls concerning this acquisition will be accepted.   Questions RFQ #35858 Department of Interior Policy, Management, and Budget Assistant Secretariat Question:  My question concerns 52.212-3, points (b) and (1).  Since I am registered at the Central Contractor Registration is that sufficient under point (b), or should I answer the questions of (1) and submit those answers along with my technical proposal? Government's Response: The Cert & Reps, 52.212-3 is required to be answered and accompany your proposal package regardless if you are registered under Central Contractor's Registration.  Question:    All concern the material necessary to develop an acceptable Price Proposal, which I understand should be developed as a time and material contract with a fixed price labor rate.     Appendix 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors, says that a "separate price summary shall be provided for the base period and each option period. Accordingly a cumulative summary price sheet shall be submitted, which is inclusive of the base period and all options." (page 7 or 10)     I do not understand what base period and option period mean in the context of this contract.       As I understand the requirements, I am to provide an hourly rate for each labor category.  Are these categories formal classifications, or can I fulfill the requirements by listing only one category, editor/writer, with one representative, me, at a set hourly rate?  And am I to propose a total dollar amount of the contract, subject to the threshold ceiling? Government's Response: I am sorry for the confusion.   This will be corrected and posted to the website.  It should read as follows: PRICING QUOTE Your cost quote shall be a separate volume from your technical submission.  Cost Quote is to be submitted as a time and material contract.   Offerors' cost quote must clearly identify the basis of the estimate.  The Offeror must identify the labor category(s) to be utilized for this effort, a description of the skills and experience per category.  Labor rate detail must be provided.  All odc's and travel detail must be provided.  Detailed Subcontractor rate information shall also be included, if applicable. 1.      Cost quote shall be based on a Fixed Hourly Labor Rates 5 year period of performance. 2.      The following information MUST BE PROVIDED with your COST Quote submission:   a.      Tax identification number (TIN) b.     Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS) c.      Complete Business Mailing Address  Question:  There is a hint at this being a small business set aside, but nothing that specifically states same... Is this effort a set aside for small businesses? Government's Response: This is not a small business set aside.   Question:  This is a nice announcement, but where are you hiding the RFQ? The search function says it does not exist. Government's Response: All the information is at our website under  Title:  RFQ 35858 DOI Policy Management Writing Support.  Below is the link. http://govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp Question:  What provided the impetus for this engagement? Government's Response: The impetus for this engagement is described in the SOW.  Interior's Office of Policy, Management and Budget does not have the expertise or human resources available to handle all of the writing projects that emerge during the course of a fiscal year. Question: How many writers are required in the proposal response? Government's Response: We have no requirements regarding the number of writers in the proposal response. Question:  Would the writing role involve drafting SOWs and working on pre-award phases of engagements? Government's Response: The writing role may involve drafting SOWs.  It is highly unlikely that the writing would involve working on pre-award phases of engagements. Question: Would the writing role involve supporting a specific MMS project or group of projects? Government's Response: The writing role will involve a specific, defined project for Offices within the Department's Office of Policy, Management and Budget (as per the list of offices contained in the SOW). Question: Are there specific projects already identified where writing resources will be engaged? Government's Response: No specific projects for the future are currently identified.  Past projects are referenced in the SOW. Question: When do you anticipate making this award? Government's Response: We anticipate making the award by September 2004. Question: What is the anticipated term of the contract?   Government's Response: The anticipated term of the contract will be three years.

<DESC>This modification to the original combined synopsis/solicitation provides additional information, and answers to questions presented by prospective offerors regarding the requirements of this Request for Proposals.

Q:  1.	“Section 1 of Work Statement “a campaign of recruitment visits to Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs)”…this statement leads us to believe that the criteria for participation in this program is attendance at one of the accredited HSIs”.
a.  Please advise if students who self-identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino Americans, who do not attend an HSI, will be eligible to participate in this program…the response to this question will have a direct impact on the scope of our recruitment effort”

A: Contractors are not required to solicit students exclusively from Hispanic Servicing Institutions (HISs).  As long as the student self-identifies as Hispanic it satisfies the requirement.

Q:  Section 7 of Work Statement “contractor will assist interns in arranging safe, ….housing.”. Please clarify if the contractor is expected (or should propose) to pay for any portion of the housing costs? 

A: Contractors are responsible of arranging safe and affordable housing. Contractors are not expected to subsidize housing.

Q:  a. Section 7 of Work Statement “In case of field placements…”. This statement leads us to believe that there may be some field placements (outside of the Washington DC area).  Please advise if these “out-of-town” students would also be expected to attend the Orientation in Washington DC, and if so, should this cost be included in the proposal?
b.  Can you provide an estimate of the % of students who could be placed in field locations, based on historical participation?

A: Contractors are expected to provide orientation to all interns (local and field). If the contractor can not bring the students to Washington, DC, they must provide on-site orientation to field students. If the contractor should include such costs in their proposal, these costs shall be priced separately and will be billed at actual cost if different from estimated cost.  Giving a rough estimate, around 20% of our students will be working in the field (year round percentage). 

Q: Please clarify if ONLY currently enrolled students are eligible for participation, or if recent graduates will also be considered eligible (by recent graduate, we define this as within 6 months of graduation)

A: Yes, only current students will be considered. 

All proposals must include a completed copy of provision 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATION AND CERTIFICATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

Statement of Work
DRC Tape/SAN Upgrade 

1.	BACKGROUND.
The DLA Resource Center (DRC) sponsored by (J-632) performs an annual Disaster Recovery applications review with each of the field activities.  This review is necessary to determine upgrades/adding additional equipment to the DRC.  During the FY04 DR applications review several new library tape drives and the tape SAN ports upgrades were identified in order to keep the DRC compatible with the field sites.  The DLA Resource Center cannot afford to be non-compatible with the DLA field activities in the event of a disaster.

2.	OBJECTIVE/SCOPE.
The DLA Resource Center (DRC) is sized and configured for recovery and processing of DLA’s critical business systems for any DLA field activity in the event processing capability is lost due to a disaster situation at a production data center.  The DRC must be maintained in a ready mode, and DLA field activities routinely relocate their critical systems processing to the DRC in order to exercise all recovery procedures.
During the FY04 annual DR applications review, several new systems were identified along with faster tape drives and the requirement for additional tape SAN ports (see list below).  The primary objective of the DLA Resource Center is to ensure the DLA field sites can recover their critical business systems in the event of a site disaster.  In order to provide such assurance, the following library and tape SAN (Brocade 12000 Switch) are necessary.
