<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA):  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG) intends to award on a sole source basis a fixed price contract for the production of the Miniature COMSEC Unit, MCU-110A and MCU-110B unit.  The MCU-110A & B unit was developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) L-3 Telemetry West (TW), 9020 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, CA 92123, CAGE CODE: 9U244, as a propriety product and received National Security Agency (NSA) certification as a Type-1 CRYPTO unit under the NSA Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP).  The proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  The Air Force does not have complete technical data or technical expertise to compete this requirement. The lack ofcompete specifications, schematics/drawings and parts lists prohibits the use of Full and Open Competition procedures.  L-3 TW is the only vendor with the required engineering knowledge, expertise and the complete drawing package to accomplish this requirement.  If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ralph Urias, at 210-925-2614, ralph.urias@us.af.mil within fifteen (15) days of this publication.

<DESC>TITLE: NNA06BC19C, ELORET Corporation NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the Aeronautics andExploration Mission Modeling and Simulation (AEMMS) service contract for an additionalsix months. This extension will provide on-going mission critical support pendingcompletion of the procurement process and award of the follow-on contract. A modificationreflecting this extension will be issued on or before June 30, 2010, which is theexpiration date of the current contract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA06BC19C which wasawarded to ELORET Corporation on May 19, 2005. This award was the result of full and opencompetition, after exclusion of sources, to a small business. The current contractconsists of a five year performance period, commencing from July 1, 2005 through June 30,2010. NASA is using the authority under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999), forthe six-month extension consisting of a two-month base and four one-month option periods.The extension will result in a contract performance period of five years and six months,if all options are exercised by the Government. The AEMMS contract includes mission-critical analytical and experimental support forvarious NASA programs including CEV Aerosciences and Thermal Protection System Insightand Oversight, CLV Risk Analysis, and, under the ARMD Hypersonics Project, and TSTOconcept design in partnership with the U.S. Air Force. The AEMMS contract supplies NASAAmes with engineering and science services, including vehicle modeling and analysis, andanalytical software tool development. Personnel skill sets include staff engineers,research and development scientists, computational fluid dynamics experts, and it supportstaff. Because ELORET possesses unique expertise in meeting the requirements of NASA AmesResearch Center, no alternate source could adequately provide this support during thisbrief extension period. The purpose of this contract action is to bridge the performance period between the endof the current contract and the anticipated award of the follow-on contract. Marketresearch has been performed and the procurement process for the follow-on contract hascommenced under NNA09274979R-NCV. The follow-on contract has been solicited on acompetitive small business set-aside basis. The Government requires continued performance of the services specified in the contract. Award to another source at the same time the follow-on competition is in process wouldresult in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling theGovernments requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested parties may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact notlater than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 10, 2010. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<ARCHDATE>07012010
<CONTACT>Tim Costas, 202-385-8570

<a href="mailto:tim.costas@faa.gov">tim.costas@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has revised the Terminal Automation Modernization Replacement (TAMR) Phase 3 approach.
TAMR3 is now structured into two segments:
Segment 1 - Near-term Terminal Automation requirements.Segment 2 - Solution Implementation to meet mid-term NextGen requirements and potential automation convergence.  
Using the TAMR3 Segmented approach, the FAA will immediately address upgrading New York TRACON (N90) to support Automated Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B).
Significant Segment 1 activities are as follows:
1.	Pending analysis, upgrade seven Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) 3Es to support ADS-B.  
The seven ARTS 3E sites are:
New York TRACON (N90), (already addressed above)Potomac TRACON (PCT), Atlanta TRACON (A80), Louisville TRACON (SDF), Dallas-Ft.Worth TRACON (D10), Northern California TRACON (NCT), and Southern California TRACON (SCT). 
2.	Identify and upgrade priority ARTS 2E sites to support ADS-B. 
3.	Establish new contract vehicle(s) to sustain Legacy Common Automated Radar Terminal Systems (CARTS) and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems (STARS) beyond 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Segment 2 will be further defined in accordance with FAA's NextGen Implementation Plan dated March 2010 to meet the Agency's needs for an automation platform that can support NextGen requirements and provide the FAA the most cost effective solution.
In arriving at the TAMR3 segmented approach, the FAA considered the responses to TAMR3 Request for Information (RFI) One and Two from industry.  The FAA may conduct industry meetings with vendors that responded to above RFIs and will hold more opportunities for industry to provide comments and recommendations for a Segment 2 solution.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to explore the predictive validity of Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program tests. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver's ability to safely operate his/her car has not been definitive. Tests used to assess impairment from drug use are usually developed for the specific study in which they are used, and are, in many cases, unstandardized. Those tests used more widely, especially by law enforcement officers, have not been specifically validated to determine impairment based on drug use (other than those that have been thusfar standardized for determining recent alcohol use). Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence. The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs. This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.</p>
<p>During an evaluation, the DRE collects information on the suspects's current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect's pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function. The DRE also examines the suspect's visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively). This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) "Face Sheet", by all DREs. Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form. The DRE also summarizes his or her observations in a narrative statement. Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures are more directly relevant. Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to:<br />(a) gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;<br />(b) code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample;<br />(c) determine accuracy of the DRE opinions using the corresponding toxicological confirmation results; and<br />(d) analyze the data to identify of groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.</p>
<p><br />Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (18) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-10-R-00376). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about May 7, 2010. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
In less than 100 years there have been four influenza pandemics: The Spanish Flu of 1918, the Asian Flu of 1957, the Hong Kong Flu of 1968, and most recently the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. Production of a vaccine to immunize against the influenza strain causing the next pandemic must occur as quickly as possible at any time of year. The ability to achieve this objective currently is limited by the seasonal nature of influenza vaccine production and seasonal variability in the availability of supplies essential to vaccine manufacture. Assuring the early availability of a sufficient quantity of vaccine for the U.S. population in the setting of a pandemic will potentially prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars.
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has an obligation to promote capabilities that assure a pandemic vaccine can be produced at a U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine facility at any time of the year, without limitations imposed by the availability of essential supplies. In addition DHHS is interested in development of investigational influenza vaccine lots against potential pandemic strains. An ongoing program is designed to support these interests.
The purpose of this requirement is twofold: (1) to assure the year-round availability of sufficient embryonated hens eggs and other essential supplies to support production of pandemic influenza vaccine at full current capacity; and (2) to produce investigational lots of pandemic-like influenza vaccine for clinical testing.
It is anticipated that the resulting contract duration will be for a 36-month base with three 24-month option periods. This requirement will be Full and Open to all sources; it is anticipated that a Request for Proposals will be issued for this requirement on or about 15 days after the release of this synopsis. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps posting system at http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the Vendors option followed by selection of the DHHS. As such, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored. Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 325412. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The 631st Electronic Systems Squadron Eagle Vision Program is requesting information only for the enhancement of the Eagle Vision system through the addition of the Pleiades satellite capability using existing commercial-off-the-shelf products (COTS).
Eagle Vision is a system that collects and processes data transmitted from commercial satellites including SPOT 2, 4, & 5, IKONOS, Radarsat 1/2, and TerraSar-X. Eagle Vision includes an antenna, and shelterized and transit-cased processing equipment that collects and processes imagery into standard commercial formats. Pleiades will provide two identical sub-meter satellites, the only capability to provide the time-critical revisit at this resolution.  Pleiades imaging will satisfy military Warfighter tactical objectives for geospatial intelligence, homeland security, humanitarian missions, and disaster relief.  Pleiades provides high accuracy, in-orbit pointing agility, minimal programming conflicts, daily worldwide access, and fast revisit frequency.  Pleiades can collect same-orbit broad-area imagery and stereo-imaging to support detailed mapping. Pleiades HR-1 and HR-2 satellites will launch early 2011 and late 2011 respectively.  
This is a Request for Information (RFI) on the COTS capability to order, downlink and process Pleiades mission data to produce Level-1 scenes in formats certified by SPOT Image.  All Pleiades formats and collection modes will be supported.  The upgrade will be compatible with the existing Eagle Vision ground station processing architecture and will be seamlessly integrated into the existing Eagle Vision systems.  Interested parties are invited to provide technical information, cost of capability, and describe customer base and experience providing such products.  Completion of all work is required no later than 12 months after award of contract. The earliest anticipated award date is January 2011.  Please provide the name of your firm, address, point of contact, phone/fax, and an electronic mail address if available.  
Interested parties should provide product information meeting the above stated requirements no later than 20 days from the date of this notice.  All responders are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern or woman-owned small business.  In addition, contractors will indicate whether or not their equipment and services are offered through the GSA schedule or any other government-wide acquisition contract.   Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting (CCR) System.  The government may solicit firms meeting the screening criteria in this RFI.  
Please submit responses via e-mail to diane.oneil@hanscom.af.mil, kiel.anderson@hanscom.af.mil, and jason.moll@hanscom.af.mil no later than 2:00 PM EDT, 23 June 2010.  Please direct any question regarding this RFI to Diane O'Neil, Contracting Officer, (781) 266-1050; Kiel Anderson, Contract Specialist, (781) 266-0502; or Captain Jason Moll, Program Manager, (781) 266-0548.  
This RFI is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The information you provide will be evaluated to identify qualified potential offers.  ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.
An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution.  In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.

<DESC>Subject:  Request for Information (RFI)Less Sensitive Minimum Smoke Ignition Material<BR>Pursuant to FAR 15.201, this notice is being issued as Research and Development Information Sought.<BR>Description:  The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is soliciting information on technology in the areas of less sensitive, minimum smoke energetic materials to aid in the development of safe ignition systems for minimum smoke propulsion systems. <BR>Capabilities:  Currently, the AMRDEC is analyzing candidate energetic materials that provide low smoke characteristics during combustion and exhibit low vulnerability to accidental ignition due to environmental stimulus.   Studies have been conducted to determine thresholds for ignition sensitivity to various stimuli such as friction, impact, electrostatic discharge (ESD), stability at constant temperature, self heating and compatibility.  Additionally, studies have been conducted to establish maximum limits on the quantities and types of smoke generated during combustion of the energetic materials.  Currently, energetic materials approved for use in rocket motor ignition systems are limited to those prescribed in MIL-STD-1901A.  This document is entitled; Safety Criteria for Munition Rocket and Missile Motor Ignition System Design and is the Department of Defense design criteria standard.  The composition of Boron/Potassium Nitrate (BKNO3) per MIL-P-46994 is the only approved pyrotechnic material for use in a position leading to the ignition of a rocket or missile motor without interruption.   Although, BKNO3 is an excellent ignition material, it is less desirable from a smoke emissions standpoint than other non-approved materials and was previously only used in very small quantities in rocket propulsion systems requiring minimum smoke characteristics.  <BR> Minimum smoke ignition materials commonly used in Army propulsion systems are double base propellants (nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine) and would not, in an unmodified state, be approved for use in future ignition systems per the standard, but may be acceptable from a smoke signature requirement perspective.  MIL-STD-1901A also identifies explosives that are acceptable for use in ignition systems.  Although these materials have useful attributes from a minimum smoke standpoint, in pure form they would not lend themselves to being practical rocket motor ignition materials especially as a primary ignition charge.<BR>Information is being requested on candidate materials or technologies to support the development of or identify existing materials to meet these requirements or is suitable for testing to evaluate their desirability for this application. The intent of this solicitation is to request information on energetic materials or energetic materials technologies with the potential of meeting the signature and the sensitivity requirements as stated.    For information or planning purposes, the AMRDEC is interested in items meeting the following specifications: <BR>a.	An ignition material that is suitable to meet the safety sensitivity requirements of MIL-STD-1901A (that is equivalent to or less sensitive than BKNO3 per the test requirements of MIL-STD-1751 for pyrotechnics).<BR>b.	An ignition material that is comparable to double base propellants from the standpoint of smoke signature characteristics.<BR>c.	An ignition material that is comparable to BKNO3 in thermal output and other desirable properties such as high burning rate, low pressure exponent, combustion at low pressures under dynamic conditions and excellent aging characteristics.<BR>d.	A material or the ingredients for candidate materials which are commercially available.<BR>e.	An ignition material or ingredients for candidate materials that lend themselves to manufacture by casting into rods, sticks, sheets, or pressing into pellets or machining to final shape.<BR>It is recognized that it may be very difficult to meet all of the objectives covered by this RFI and that some compromises may have to be made, but the dual objectives of mission requirements with regard to smoke signature and the safety requirements of  MIL-STD-1901 must be met.  Industry comments on this subject and especially with respect to materials, classes of materials, recommendations on energetic binders or oxidizers that should be considered, are requested.  The testing of promising vendor furnished igniter compositions to evaluate their suitability also interests the AMRDEC.<BR>Aspects of the chemical technology that are proprietary or have usage restrictions such as licensing requirements should be clearly identified.  Appropriate proprietary claims will be honored and protected to prevent improper disclosure.<BR>Responses:  Comments and responses are requested within thirty (30) days from publication of this notice and should be provided in writing.  Send five copies of written responses to the attention of U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Attn: RDMR-WDP-E, (Mark Kirkham), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898. <BR>Disclaimer:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) <BR>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<BR>(b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<BR>(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining a technology survey to assist in the planning of possible future programs<BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and is not considered to be a commitment by the Government.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO ENTER ANY TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THIS NOTIFICATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

<RESPDATE>063010
<CONTACT>Jagdish Narayan, Contracts Specialist, Phone 2023254467, Email jagdish.narayan@cbp.dhs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) to generate questions, comments, and reports from industry on existing capabilities to create a modern, efficient, and secure U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) admission process of travelers. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, or Request for Quotes. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.<br />BACKGROUND: CBP within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) protects the nation's borders from terrorism, human and drug smuggling, illegal migration, and agricultural pests while simultaneously facilitating the flow of legitimate travel and trade.<br />A major force behind executing CBP's mission is CBP's Office of Field Operations (OFO). The CBP officers within OFO process 400 million travelers to the United States; inspect 122 million cars, trucks, planes, and ships; examine 2 million cargo containers; and, collect $34 billion in duty per year. The OFO controls the processing of these items across 327 ports of entry (POE), 58 operational container security initiative ports, and 15 preclearance stations.<br />Each of the travelers crossing into the U.S. must undergo CBP processing. The inspection process consists of performing a systems query of each passenger's name in a U.S. law enforcement database prior to or when they arrive into the U.S. If the traveler is a U.S. citizen, the CBP officer obtains a verbal declaration from the traveler, examines the passenger's passport, if required, and validates/verifies the authenticity of the document(s) presented, concludes they are a U.S. citizen and welcomes them back to the U.S. If the passenger is an alien the CBP officer must obtain a verbal declaration of the citizenship of each traveler, examine the travel documents, perform system queries of the alien's name in U.S. databases, determine why they are visiting the U.S., do they have proper documentation, and determine how long, if at all, they should be allowed to stay in the U.S.<br />CBP officers currently process travelers manually validating their stay with an admission stamp placed on one of their travel documents (i.e., passport) and on an Arrival/Departure Record, Form I-94 or I-94W if an alien, and on a CBP Declaration, if arriving at an airport of seaport. The stamp serves as evidence of compliance that the traveler(s) has completed the CBP process. Since the admission stamp serves as a compliance receipt confirming the CBP officer processed the traveler, CBP regards the admission stamp as a highly secured item. If an admission stamp was lost or stolen it could lead to instances of fraud and illegal entry of travelers to the U.S. <br />When a traveler (U.S. citizen or foreign visitor) enters through a U.S. air or sea POE they are subject to the CBP processing. The traveler first enters into the CBP's primary screening processing lane where a CBP officer reviews the required travel documents and briefly interviews the traveler regarding the intention of their trip. This interview varies in length and depth based on whether the traveler is a U.S. citizen or foreign visitor and on the traveler's specific answers to the interview questions. If satisfied, the CBP officer stamps the documentation and sends the traveler to retrieve their luggage and to proceed to exit control CBP officers.<br />U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents usually receive two (2) admission stamps: one (1) on their CBP Declaration and one (1) in their passport (see Figure 1 (in Attachment): Admission Process of U.S. Citizens). A non-U.S. citizen visitor usually receives four (4) admission stamps, two (2) on their Form I-94 or I-94W, one (1) on their passport, and one (1) on their CBP Declaration (see Figure 2 (in Attachment): Admission Process of Non-U.S. Citizens).<br />If admissible, the CBP officer then adds the class of admission and date the traveler may remain in the U.S. manually. At land ports of entry the I-94 is created electronically. However, if the CBP officer determines the traveler requires further screening then the CBP officer sends the traveler to secondary screening for further processing.<br />Within secondary screening the traveler undergoes further inspection by the CBP officer. The passenger faces several outcomes in secondary screening. The CBP officer may permit the traveler to enter the U.S., the CBP officer may detain the traveler, or the CBP officer may send the traveler back to their port of embarkation or country of citizenship. Similar to the primary screening the traveler in the secondary screening receives stamped documents depending on their disposition. <br />If the traveler is given permission to enter the U.S., the traveler proceeds to the exit control CBP officer. At exit control, the CBP officer confirms the traveler's permission to enter the U.S. and allows the traveler to exit the CBP area and enter the U.S.<br />OBJECTIVE: CBP is seeking information on industry capabilities on establishing a modernized, efficient, and cost effective electronic admission process that will improve security and accuracy of information, eliminate the manual stamping process, collaborate with current computer software systems, and minimize the risk of theft and the ability for travelers to gain illegal entry.<br />STATMENT OF WORK: See attached document labeled "SOW for Electronic Admission Stamp."<br />QUESTIONS OR INQUIRIES: Responders shall submit any questions regarding this RFI electronically to JAGDISH.Narayan@dhs.gov, by 5:00pm, June 10, 2010. CBP will not consider any questions after this date. CBP will review the questions and amend the RFI as required.<br />SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE no later than 2:00pm, Eastern Time, June 30, 2010. The response shall be e-mailed to: JAGDISH.Narayan@dhs.gov. Responses to the notice will neither be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. Information provided in response to this notice will be used to assess alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract. <br />CBP will use the information submitted in response to this notice at its discretion and will not provide comments to any submission; however, the content of any responses to this notice may be reflected in subsequent solicitation. CBP reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing CBP's understanding of the notice submission.<br />This announcement is Government Market Research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.<br />It is emphasized that this is a notice for planning and information purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited.&nbsp;<br />

The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is soliciting input, with particular emphasis on Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone and other socio-economic concerns, to determine the technical, administrative, management and financial capability of potential offerors to provide the type of system/equipment that meets MSC requirements given in the background provided below.<br /><br />Interested offerors must submit a brief but complete capability statement that demonstrates the capability to provide the necessary system/equipment capable of addressing the issues below for an evaluation no later than 11 June 2010. This information will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in developing the procurement strategy, including whether a small business set-aside is warranted.<br /><br />This is a request for information only and your response is not an offer. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay for any costs incurred in preparation of any submission to this market survey. All responses to this market survey should be forwarded to Mr. F. Paul Lirio via fax (202) 685-5965 or email, francis.lirio@navy.mil.<br /><br />1. Background: The Military Sealift Command (MSC) is investigating the feasibility of design and installation of a heat recovery steam generation system to support all shipboard auxiliary steam demands on the T-AKR 310 class of ships.<br /><br />Currently, five Caterpillar 3608 Ships Service Diesel Generators (SSDG) are onboard, each with an independent exhaust that extends approximately 100 feet up the stack. Auxiliary steam is generated onboard by one of two oil-fired Clayton model EO-304-2 steam generators (300 boiler horsepower, operating pressure is 125-150 psig, net output at 100 psig from 60&deg; F [15.6&deg; C] feedwater is 8,645 lb/hr, equivalent output from and at 212&deg; F [100&deg; C] feedwater is 10,350 lb/hr). The majority of the auxiliary steam demand onboard comes from the distillers (Alfa Laval model DPU-2-36-C100), steam heating and cargo hold humidifiers, and various sludge/sump tank steam heating coils. MSC hopes to eliminate the need to operate either steam boiler.<br /><br />2. Market Survey Response Instructions: Contractors are requested to provide options for generating steam equivalent to the output of one of the existing auxiliary steam boilers. Assume that the exhaust of any two or three SSDGs (each loaded to 60% of rated capacity) will be used as the heat source.<br /><br />Responses to this market survey shall use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions and should include a description of the recommended shipboard alteration/installation.<br /><br />In addition to the information requested above, interested parties shall furnish the following information:<br /><br />1. Name of Organization<br /><br />2. Telephone/Fax Number, Address, and Email address for the primary point of contact<br /><br />3. Brief description of your organization's capabilities<br /><br />4. Brief summary of organization's history relative to similar requirements<br /><br />5. Small business standing (i.e. large or small business, specific category of small business)<br /><br />6. An estimate of the labor necessary to meet this requirement with the associated estimated labor rates for each position.<br /><br />7. Additional comments/questions about the specifics of this requirement.<br /><br />IT IS REQUESTED THAT THE ABOVE INFORMATION BE PROVIDED NO LATER THAN 11 JUNE 2010. RESPONSES SHOULD BE FAXED TO (202) 685-5965 OR EMAILED TO FRANCIS.LIRIO@NAVY.MIL.<br /><br />THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS ACTION IS MR. F.

Therefore, contractor will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (10 year) amortization schedule.    
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration. The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code.

<DESC>This Notice SupersedesSPAWAR_Headquarters_MKTSVY_81F82.1.0 DESCRIPTION: 1.1 The Space andNaval Warfare Systems Command(SPAWAR) is seeking sources for thepotential development of AdvancedTime Division Multiple Access (TDMA)Interface Processor (ATIP). The ATIP isan advancement of the Navys TDMAInterface Processor (TIP), whichoperates on legacy Navy ExtremelyHigh Frequency (EHF) MDR capableterminals. ATIP will include support forIPv6/IPv4 packet forwarding, AdvancedExtremely High Frequency (AEHF) XDRdata rates (up to 8 Mbps), improvedQoS, advances in dynamic TDMA slotassignment, and include backwardcompatibility to the TIP. Thearchitecture will implement Layer-2Ethernet bridging among users that aregeographically dispersed andconnected via Milstar Medium DataRate (MDR), Advanced EHF BackwardCompatible MDR and XDR, or EnhancedPolar System XDR satellite links. ATIPwill also allow users within each beamarea to share on an EHF/AEHF servicethe uplink on a dynamic TDMA basisand receive from other beam areas(other EHF/AEHF services) to provide afull duplex connectivity using halfduplex EHF/AEHF services. Eachindividual service is denoted as a TDMASubnet and the collection of these forthe full duplex connectivity is denotedas a Supernet in ATIP terminology(and as used herein). The ATIP isfunctionally divided into two elements:(1) the ATIP Processor (AP) and (2)the Terminal Interface (TIF). It isanticipated that the AP will be aCommercial Off The Shelf (COTS)processor(s) circuit card assembly(CCA) with appropriate softwaredevelopment and that the TIF may beimplemented by a Field ProgrammableGate Array (FPGA) hardware/firmwareCCA(s). The AP and TIF are connectedvia Ethernet to support variableinstallation configurations and eachelement will be rack mountable andmeet Navy platform environmentalrequirements. Within the ATIParchitecture, the AP interfaces to up tosix (6) physical user network devicesand the TIF interfaces with up to eight(8) EHF/AEHF services. The ATIPincludes the following functionalarchitecture components: NetworkInterface Function, Quality of Service(QoS) Function, Forwarding Function,TDMA Transmit and Receive (Rx)Processing Functions, Control/StatusMonitoring Function and TerminalInterface Function. The first sixfunctional capabilities are intended tobe implemented in software within theAP COTS CCA. The followingparagraphs summarize the ATIPcapabilities by functional architecturecomponent. 1.1.1 The NetworkInterface function provides theconnection to local network devices tosupport the Layer-2 Ethernet bridgingfunction implemented by the ATIP.ATIP assigns a single Ethernetinterface per Supernet, supporting10Base-T/100Base TX/1000Base-Toperation. 1.1.2 The QoS andForwarding functions are used toprovide layer-2 frame forwardingbehavior in accordance with userapplication delivery needs as identifiedin a Subnet QoS policy. QoS-basedframe forwarding is performedseparately by each TDMA Subnetmember in coordination with directionfrom the TDMA Net Controller (NC).Using in- band protocols, membersinform the NC of their traffic flows andthe NC allocates bandwidth accordingly.1.1.3 TDMA Subnet Managementfunctions support establishment of theTDMA Subnet structure by the NC,member join/exit processing, memberstatus reporting to the NC, NC dynamicbandwidth assignment, and Subnet NCmanagement handover. Subnetactivation and join are operatoractivated, but once Subnets are active,the member and NC autonomouslycoordinate status and dynamicresource allocation. The TDMA subnetstructure (# timeslots per cycle, max #members, etc.) is established throughNC periodic transmission of a SequenceOrder List (SOL) message whichcontains the TDMA Subnet parametersas well as TDMA timeslot assignmentsfor each Subnet member. Timeslotsare assigned to members by the NC inresponse to member traffic flow reportsand the configured ATIP QoS policy.1.1.4 The TDMA Tx Processingfunctions support formation of TDMATransmission Units (TUs) based on theQoS / Forwarding policy, andtransmission of the TUs in the timeslot(s) designated for the member in theNC SOL message. These packetsinclude both data packets andTIP/ATIP protocol messages betweenthe TDMA Subnet members and the NCmanaging the TDMA Subnet. TUs willbe formed on a just-in-time basis,using TDMA slot timing informationfrom the TIF, and provided to the TIFfor transmission in the NC-assignedtimeslots. 1.1.5 TDMA Rx Processingfunctions support extraction of dataand protocol packets from TUsprovided by the TIF which were receivedover-the air, filtering out packetsdestined for the current ATIP, anddelivery of the packet contents to theappropriate interface. 1.1.6 TheControl/Status Monitoring functionprovides the operator interface to theATIP. Status Monitoring provides ATIPoperating status to the operator,including hardware status, interfacestatus, Supernet/Subnet operationstatus, packet processing status, andATIP event status (e.g. SubnetJoin/Exit, NC handover, etc). ATIPControl supports receipt of ATIPconfiguration and operatingparameters from the operator,performing input parameterconsistency checks, and implementingthe specified configuration on the ATIP.The ATIP Control/Status Monitoringfunction will use a browser-based userinterface with Transport Layer Securityprotocol, eliminating the need for aseparate ATIP Operator Interfaceapplication program and specially-configured PC. In addition, the ATIPControl and Status Monitoring functionwill support an Operator orderwirecapability. 1.1.7 The Terminal Interfacefunction (TIF) is responsible forexchanging ATIP TU data with thecrypto/EHF terminal in synchronizationwith the timeslots allocated to themember ATIP on transmit and for alltimeslots on receive. Timeslotboundaries are identified throughreceipt of TDMA timing signals from theterminal which are multiples of SubnetTDMA timeslots. TIF processingincludes two key sub-functions: (a)identification of timeslot boundary forboth uplink and downlink and (b) serialexchange of TU data with thecrypto/EHF terminal using standardsynchronous serial protocols. The TIFprovides serial interface status,including the detection of EHF/AEHFservice activation, to the AP to supportcontrol/status monitoring of ATIPSubnets. 2.0 SYNPOSIS TERMS - THISIS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSISONLY.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, is seeking small business sources for a construction project entitled Little Goose Wastewater Treatment Facility.  The work is located at the Little Goose Lock and Dam and Reservoir, Snake River, Columbia County, Washington.  This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract.  Construction magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  A bid bond of 20% or $3,000,000, whichever is less, will be required.  100% performance and payment bonds will be required.<BR><BR>Summary of Statement of Work<BR><BR>Waste Water Treatment Plant relocation involves the following items: <BR>Removal of an existing 3000 gallon sewage treatment tank and appurtenant pumps and piping in an existing sewage treatment room located within the lower levels of the dam power house facility.  It will require installation of approximately 3000 feet of pipeline; with 1500 feet routed from the sewage treatment room through existing inside pipe chases and galleries of the dam to the downstream end of the navigation lock; and continuing outside of the navigation lock another 1500 feet with buried sewage piping which will end at the new drain field location.  This outside piping will require trenching and backfilling for placement of the buried sewer piping.  The surfacing of the trench will involve asphalt repair, dry land grass seeding, and gravel.  This pipeline will serve to channel septic tank effluent from the sewage treatment room to an external sump for a low pressure pumped drain field.  This effort will also require fabrication and installation of a new sewage tank within the sewage treatment room.  A new pump station is to be installed to transfer the treated liquids.  This station is to include two new pumps and appurtenant valves for fluid control.  A low pressure pump and controls is to be installed to supply the new drain field laterals from a buried sump tank which is to be located and installed adjacent to the required drain field.   The holding tank, pumps, and the drain field are to be installed in an area approximately 1500 feet downstream and approximately 150 feet from an existing well.  A new fence is to be installed around the perimeter of the drain field.  New electrical service will be installed to support the effluent pump and septic tank level controls, electric heat tracing to provide freeze protection for a portion of the pipeline run outside the dam, and to power the drain field injection pumps and their controls.<BR><BR>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Documents/EM385-1-1FINAL.pdf.  <BR><BR>This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify concerns with the capability to accomplish the work.

The  size standard is 500 Employees.<BR>In FY2006, as a result of an ESTCP competitive solicitation, a contract was awarded to Geometrics, Inc. (W912HQ-06-C-0041) for development and demonstration of an innovative, UXO-specific electromagnetic induction sensor system.  As part of this project, Geometrics demonstrated their sensor system (named MetalMapper) at the ESTCP Live Site Demonstration at the former San Luis Obispo, CA.  MetalMapper turned out to be the best performing system at this demonstration but, as this was the first live site survey attempted by the contractor, a number of questions arose concerning the optimum sensor configuration and data processing methodologies that will require investigation to optimize the performance of the MetalMapper.  This optimization will involve analysis of the design of MetalMapper and investigation of alternative analysis methods for the data collected.<BR>The  Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is seeking  business to clearly identify capability, knowledge, and similar work experience for remediation of lands contaminated by unexploded ordnance (UXO) is a high-priority DoD program.  By some estimate, 70% of the total cost of such clean-up goes to removing non-hazardous buried metal from the site being remediated.  If  methods could be developed to discriminate UXO from non-hazardous metal, tremendous savings could be achieved.  Geometrics has developed and demonstrated the MetalMapper system to accomplish detection and discrimination of UXO.  Although this sensor had achieved excellent results in live site demonstrations, a number of fundamental issues need to be addressed to optimize this sensor.  A one-year retrospective self evaluation is proposed.  <BR>This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 3:00 pm, 16 June 2010.

<RESPDATE>061610
<ARCHDATE>06162010

<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MCSC) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability to support the fielded Joint Tactical Common Operational Picture (COP) Workstation (JTCW) Client and Gateway (C&GW) software.
JTCW provides a framework for enhanced systems interoperability and commonality between MAGTF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.  The JTCW is a Windows-based tactical COP workstation suite of applications designed to facilitate military C2 functions by improving Situational Awarness (SA) and enhancing operational and tactical decision-making.  The primary software component of JTCW is the C&GW.  The C&GW software originated from the Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) software baseline.  The Client provides Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for Application Extensions (AEs) to interact with the map and other features of the Client.  The Gateway offers a unique capability for JTCW, allowing the Client to receive data from an Intelligence-Operations System (IOS) or Global Command and Control System (GCCS).  The Gateway provides the ability for a host of connection options: from the GCCS and IOS, to other Gateways.  The JTCW Client provides the Marines with a disconnected network capability.  This functionality can be used at various echelons.  Upon establishing connectivity, the Gateway can reconnect without the need to reconfigure Clients.  The JTCW Gateway is used throughout the Marine Corps, and across Services.  JTCW is the primary point of entry for the COP where users are able to view map data, view and update track data, develop and distribute overlays, exchange general message traffic, plan and distribute route information, and conduct general C2 planning.  The addition of JTCW AEs, with other applications and services to the core software provides the functionality that enhances JTCW's ability to meet directed JTCW operational requirements.  
JTCW C&GW is very complex software and is comprised of about 2.8 million lines of code that includes a significant number of modules, injectors, folders and interfaces.  The government has government purpose rights to the source code and technical data package.  The JTCW C&GW code is based on a Component Oriented Middleware (COM) framework, and is written in C, C++, C#, and JAVA languages.  The government will maintain government purpose rights on any software modified or developed for this effort.
The Command and Control Compact Edition (C2CE) software was developed to complement C2PC on a Personal Data Assistant.  The C2CE application allows for the display of digital maps produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and display of the user's position using the embedded SAASM GPS.  When connected to a combat net radio, an operator can utilize C2CE to create, transmit and receive Variable Message Format (VMF) messages, free text messages and display tracks/positions of other users with the JTCW C&GW.
This Request For Information (RFI) addresses the efforts required to provide Post Delivery Software Support (PDSS) and Systems Engineering support to PM MAGTF Command and Control Systems (MC2S) for JTCW C&GW, C2CE, the JTCW integrated build and MAGTF C2 Tactical Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) integration efforts.  Specifically this effort requires; in service systems engineering support, software engineering support to include technical assistance in software integration, Software Trouble Report (STR) root cause isolation, STR correction, software testing, software delivery and software documentation.  Software maintenance will include required Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment updates, updates to maintain critical interoperability, and migration of software into the Tactical SOA environment.
The contractor will provide systems engineering and software support to the MAGTF C2 Tactical SOA Systems Engineering working groups in the development of tactical Services Oriented Infrastructure (SOI).  Specific emphasis of this task is to identify capabilities currently, or planned to be, incorporated in JTCW which will support or interface with the tactical SOI.  Additionally, recommendations in the form of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to enhance interfacing with the SOI shall be presented.  The contractor is expected to conduct risk management, configuration management, and information assurance according to MIL-STD 61A, IEEE 12207 and industry standards.  
Interested sources are requested to submit a capability statement outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement not to exceed 5 pages.  Vendors interested in potential subcontracting opportunities are invited to respond.  All interested sources shall identify their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business status.  Interested sources shall send all capability statements via email to lisa.burns@usmc.mil no later than the end of business, June 16th, 2010.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>Description: Field &amp; Laboratory Immunological Phycotoxin Poison Examination by Rapid Sensors
<p>This is an RFI NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (i.e. certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses) for Field &amp; Laboratory Immunological Phycotoxin Poison Examination by Rapid Sensors.</p>
<p>This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this will be included on the source list. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. FDA may consider soliciting services for a two year contract.</p>
<p>Draft Objective:</p>
<p>The FDA is responsible for the safety of seafood harvested from federal waters and seafood that is available through interstate commerce. Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a common human illness that is caused by the consumption of seafood contaminated with these natural neurotoxins known collectively as the saxitoxins (STXs). Immunological based assays are needed to detect when toxin levels in seafood exceed a safe threshold. However, the antibody, or suite of antibodies, that is used in such immunological based assays is of critical importance. Commercially available antibody-based kits for detecting the STXs do not demonstrate a cross reactivity with the other congeners in a way that reflects potency. The purpose of this contract is to produce a number of antibodies to the STXs to determine the best antibody or suite of antibodies for use in detection methods that would more accurately measure toxicity. The selected antibodies will then be available for use by FDA and for a commercial test kit manufacturer to develop test kits such as lateral flow devices.</p>
<p>Draft Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The contract must provide for development of antibodies for seafood toxin analysis methods.</p>
<p>Part 1. Services<br />Personnel must perform their tasks to develop the materials and required characterization of produced materials. For characterization, the antibodies selected must be shown to have a high affinity and selectivity for one or more members of the PSP toxin family. Antibodies with IC50s of greater than 20ppb will be excluded. At least four antibodies must be produced that fulfill this criterion. Affinity should be determined using surface Plasmon resonance based assays and avidity can be determined using ELISAs.</p>
<p>Part 2. Production of toxin-protein conjugates<br />Specific requirements: All conjugates must be assessed for their incorporation rate of PSP. Only conjugates with a greater than 1:1 molar ratio of toxin to protein must be considered suitable for the project. At least 4 toxin-protein conjugates (including STX-KLH) must be produced meeting these specifications and 0.5 mg each will be delivered to FDA.</p>
<p>Part 3. Production of monoclonal antibodies<br />Specific requirements: All clones selected must be shown to be inhibited by presence of one or more members of the PSP toxin family. At least 4 antibodies must be selected that fulfill this criterion. Each antibody must be characterized as described above, and 5 mg each will be delivered to FDA.</p>
<p>We may anticipate a firm fixed price type contract for five years.</p>
<p>Viable parties shall provide the following:</p>
<p>Part A. Capabilities and Technical Experience - Provide a capability statement describing how your company would provide Field &amp; Laboratory Immunological Phycotoxin Poison Examination by Rapid Sensors as provided in the Draft Scope of Work.</p>
<p>Part B. Size of Business- Please provide your business size and submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status.</p>

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER CONTRACT NO. AG-3A75-C-09-0019.

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is announcing a project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  NRCS is seeking proposal for A&E Services under Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0019.  A Task Order will be issued to HDR Engineering Group, Inc., for independent design review of an ARRA Watershed Rehabilation project in the state of Georgia: Little Sandy Trail Site 1.  The NAICS Code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  Design Review with detail cost proposal from HDR Engineering Group, Inc. is due no later than close of business on June 3, 2010.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquistion Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  

	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
	Addresses unique site conditions 
	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.  (Note: A waiver of NRCS hydrologic design criteria has been granted to allow modification of this dam to Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Safe Dams Program hydrologic criteria.)

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services,Inc., W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake and Dam Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK.  The modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for to: Cut and remove vegetation from the Acworth sub dam and apply herbicide to retard future growth. This will include the East and West approaches on both sides of the roadway. The area has thick vegetation along with small trees that must be removed. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintenance of landscaped areas, overlook cleaning, debris removal, tree removal, and natural resource management.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into existing contract.     <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work.The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. 2) The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>Work includes, but is not limited to, providing all material, labor, and equipment necessary to replace the HVAC system for a 95,000 square foot facility at the Lawrence Main Post Office (MPO), 431 Common Street, Essex County, Massachusetts.  The estimated cost of the work is between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 with construction completion no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed.

There will be a pre-proposal for this project held on Thursday, June 17, 2010 beginning at 11:00 a.m. on site.  Attendance is not mandatory but is strongly recommended.   Offerors are encouraged to visit the site.  On-site visits may be arranged by contacting Kathleen Newton, Maintenance, at (978) 691-4588.  Technical inquires are to be addressed to the Project Architect Alvin Robinson, III of RDK Engineers at (978) 475-0298 or the Project Andrew L. Stein at (603) 427-6282.

This is not a formal invitation for bid; therefore, no bid bond or proposal guarantee is required.

As part of the evaluation process, all offerors MUST SUBMIT a COMPANY HEALTH & SAFETY PLAN.  Prior to award, the successful contractor will be required to submit a PROJECT SPECIFIC SAFETY PLAN acceptable to the USPS Contracting Officer.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately of equal important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment includes any or all of the following: a back-illuminated sensor as described in specification 1; cooling below -90 C (absolute) as described in specification 2; a lens and mirror system as described in specification 4. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness, in accordance with 52.217-5.  Price will be evaluated based on the cumulative total of all the line item prices.  

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. 
Non-Governmental Acquisition Support 
The Government may utilize non-Governmental acquisition support for processing of quotations submitted in response to this solicitation. These individual(s) will have access to the quotation information and will be assisting the Contracting Officer in the procurement process by performing services including, but not limited to, preparing the quotations for submission to the technical evaluators, performing past performance checks, and preparing award documents.  The non-Governmental acquisition support will not conduct technical evaluations of any quotation and will not be involved in the final decision as to the awardee under this procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Laser Hygrometer. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a laser-based hygrometer for use as a check standard for tests performed using the NIST Hybrid Humidity Generator (HHG) and as a gas purifier performance monitor for the purified air used as a diluents gas within the HHG.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Laser Hygrometer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>1. Sensing Technique - The measured water vapor concentration must be determined by laser-absorption spectroscopy, with the exception that water vapor concentrations obtained by comparison of the spectroscopic measurements of the test gas to spectroscopic measurements of a second gas source are not permissible.</p>
<p>2. Environmental Requirements - The hygrometer must be capable of operating in an environment of 20 &ordm;C &plusmn; 10 &ordm;C, with relative humidity of 50% RH +/- 20%.</p>
<p>3. Input Line Voltage Requirements - The hygrometer shall operate on 110VAC, at 60 Hz, and draw less than 5 Amperes.</p>
<p>4. Sample Gas Composition and Gas Flow Capacity - The maximum operating flow rate through the hygrometer shall be at least 1 standard liters per minute (SLM) of humidified air.</p>
<p>5. Inlet Pressure Capacity - The hygrometer must be compatible with sample gas at ambient pressure. The appropriate pump shall be supplied by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Hygrometer Performance Specifications:</p>
<p>1. Operating Range - The operating range shall be from 20 X 10-9 (ppb) to 500 X 10-6 (ppm) of water in air. The 20 ppb value is required so that we can insure that the water vapor background in purified air diluents is within the uncertainty specifications for the HHG.</p>
<p>2. Response Time - 95% response time shall be 3 minutes or less. This requirement allows us to routinely sample the purified diluents stream at the start of calibrations requiring use of purified air.</p>
<p>3. Accuracy - Specified accuracy shall be the greater of +/- 4% of reading or +/- 10 ppb.</p>
<p>4. Stability of Zero Reading - The analyzer response to a purified gas stream shall not drift by more than 10 ppb or the analyzer's sensitivity specification, whichever is less.</p>
<p>Construction Materials and Methods:</p>
<p>1. Wetted Materials - Wetted materials within the hygrometer must be compatible with making part per billion measurements. Generally, this means that components coming in contact with the test gas should be constructed of electro-polished, passivated 316L stainless steel, with a surface finish of 10 micro-inches RA (roughness average) or smoother.</p>
<p>2. Use of Elastomers / Elastomeric Seals - No elastomers or elastomeric seals may be used in any way that contacts the test gas stream upstream of and including the sampling cell, including applications in which the elastomer does not directly contact the gas stream, but whose proximity to the stream might create a water vapor concentration gradient that could contribute water vapor to the test gas stream, as in face-sealing applications.</p>
<p>The following specification is a brand name (Swagelok) or equal. Brand name or equal is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency requirement.</p>
<p>3. Gas Connections and Tubing Fittings - All gas connections and tubing end fittings shall be &frac14; inch diameter Swagelok VCR connections or equivalent, which shall meet the following salient characteristic: Metal Face-Seal Fittings. All fittings shall possess electro-polished and passivated interior surfaces as specified above.</p>
<p>4. Welding - Tubing runs shall be orbital welded, consistent with current high-purity practices employed by the semiconductor processing industry.</p>
<p>5. Leak Rate of Assembled Components - The maximum allowable leak rate is 2 x 10-8 mbar - liter/sec.</p>
<p>Data Handling / Storage / Outputs:</p>
<p>1. Data Display - The output graphical display shall be scalable by the user.</p>
<p>2. Analog Outputs - Analog outputs shall be supplied for each gas input channel. Acceptable outputs are 0 to 10 VDC, 4-20 mA, or 0-20 mA. The outputs shall be scalable with a minimum range corresponding to a water vapor concentration from 0 ppb to 500 ppm.</p>
<p>3. Data Transfer Capability - The hygrometer shall be provided with either a serial port interface or IEEE-488 interface for data transfer.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. Technical Capability is more important than Past Performance. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(See Statement of Work below for Requirements.)</p>
<p>This requirement is subject to all terms and conditions of the Service Contract Act. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) does not own and cannot provide drawings or specifications. Contractor is to provide Federal Aviation Administration Certifications or Department of Defense (DOD) certifications with their proposal. The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification. Inspection is by Certificate of Conformance and acceptance shall be performed at destination by USCG, ALC Quality Assurance. <br />The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. <br />The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the repair directive. <br />Repair pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new; Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government.

Evidence of other certifications, such as a DOD Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.

<p>High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the repair prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during repair shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, ALC engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification. Inspection is by Certificate of Conformance and acceptance shall be performed at destination by USCG, ALC Quality Assurance.

<p>The Government intends to award one or more Firm Fixed Price Requirements type contract(s) for Depot Level Repair of the various avionics components listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services. The Government intends to use the policies and procedures of FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 15 -Contracting by Negotiation with the Contract Format set forth in FAR 12.303.

<p>This Procurement is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for Competition for a Commercial Item. All responsible Business sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Firm-fixed prices are required for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) and must include labor, parts, scrap charge and inspection/no fault found to facilitate the necessary repair of the component.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make <br />contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency <br />Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them <br />without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing <br />authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as <br />the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG <br />as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the <br />GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns <br />informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or <br />Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG <br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the <br />cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, <br />the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency <br />Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract <br />award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement <br />for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, <br />interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: <br />solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation <br />closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency <br />protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the <br />contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are <br />unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may <br />file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, <br />the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be <br />suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, <br />in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the <br />best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 <br />calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in <br />FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the <br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing <br />of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the <br />period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program <br />should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-866-618-5988, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 8, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>

<DESC>The standalone unit that will house the 6 large pelican cases will need to have some form doors or a way to close and hide the equipment from sight.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also like all of the movable units be able to move all together at the same time. i.e. one shelving unit crank can move all units instead of moving each shelving unit one at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will need at a minimum, a 48" walking clearance around the entire movable storage system (bulk storage area) in the open area.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to post Questions and Answers:

1. Are the feature sizes actually .4um or are you looking for a measuring resolution of .4um or better?  If the feature sizes are actually .4um and smaller, this is at or approaching the limit of traditional microscopes optical resolution and may require a different type of microscope system, such as a confocal microscope which can optically resolve features of this size.  

Q1. The microscope (either traditional or confocal) should be able to measure features down to  0.4 microns.  In other words, 0.4 microns is the smallest feature I am looking to measure.   

2. The second question is related to the Sidewall angle measurement in the Evaluation Criteria Section.  Can you provide any additional information on this measurement?  

Q2.  A linewidth or space is usually not a perfect 90 degree angle.  If a system can use intensity profiles to measure sidewall angles of the features, that would be an added benefit, but not required.

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, appliesto this acquisition.9.   The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, will not beused.  The following clause will be used to evaluate proposals.M-307  EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD (BEST VALUE)(a) The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to thatresponsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation, is determinedtoprovide the "best value" to the Government.  Such offer may not necessarily bethe proposal offering the lowest cost or receiving the highest technical rating.(b) Proposals will be rated and ranked on the evaluation factors listed below.It should be noted that cost is not a numerically weighted factor.  Althoughtechnical factors are significantly more important than cost, cost is animportantfactor and should be considered when preparing responsive proposals. Theimportance of cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree ofequality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.Whenthe offerors within the competitive range are considered essentially equal interms of technical capability, or when cost is so significantly high as todiminishthe value of the technical superiority to the government, cost may become thedetermining factor for award.  In summary, cost/technical trade-offs will bemade, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governedonly by the tests of rationality and consistency with the establishedevaluationfactors.Factor 1 and Factor 2 are of equal importance and are more importantindividually than Factor 3.Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS.10.  Offerors shall include in their proposal a completed copy of the provisionat 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items,with its offer.  A copy of 52.212-3 is included as Attachment 2 to thissolicitation.11.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- CommercialItems, applies to this acquisition and is included in this solicitation..12. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required ToImplement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to thisacquisition.  Additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are included as anattachment to this solicitation.13.  Additional Information:The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) may be accessed at:http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.Offerors shall submit a price for each CLIN in paragraph  5 above based on thenine milestones described in paragraph 7 above.L-324  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSALS(a) The technical proposal shall cover your understanding of the work and yourmethod to attain contract objectives.  The technical approach shall enabletechnical personnel to make a thorough evaluation and a determination as towhether the product proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of thegovernment.  The technical proposal shall be specific, detailed and completeand fully demonstrate that the prospective offeror has a thoroughunderstanding of the government's requirements.  Statements that theprospective offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications,statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, and phrases suchas "standard procedures will be employed" or "well known techniques will beused," etc., will be considered insufficient.(b) Specifically, the following information should be included in yourtechnicalproposal:Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE:The offeror shall provide  3  descriptions of relevant projects worked on inthepast 10 years that are of similar structural size and also included sea towing.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE:The offeror shall provide 3 contact references for projects worked on in thepast10 years.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS:The offeror shall submit a project plan, similar to a business plan, detailingtheprocess either planned or in place for the project that will confirm allcriticalrequirements and specifications listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) will

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the solicitation notice is to upload the solicitation and related documents to request proposals by the cut-off date listed herein.<br /><br /><br />Synopsis:
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to explore the predictive validity of Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program tests. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver's ability to safely operate his/her car has not been definitive. Tests used to assess impairment from drug use are usually developed for the specific study in which they are used, and are, in many cases, unstandardized. Those tests used more widely, especially by law enforcement officers, have not been specifically validated to determine impairment based on drug use (other than those that have been thusfar standardized for determining recent alcohol use). Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence. The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs. This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.</p>
<p>During an evaluation, the DRE collects information on the suspects's current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect's pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function. The DRE also examines the suspect's visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively). This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) "Face Sheet", by all DREs. Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form. The DRE also summarizes his or her observations in a narrative statement. Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures are more directly relevant. Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to:<br />(a) gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;<br />(b) code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample;<br />(c) determine accuracy of the DRE opinions using the corresponding toxicological confirmation results; and<br />(d) analyze the data to identify of groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.</p>
<p><br />Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (18) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-10-R-00376). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about May 7, 2010. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 
A list of surveys to be completed under this action is located in the attached statement of work.  The surveyor must be a licensed land surveyor in the State of Minnesota. The Surveyor will provide a boundary survey of the easement area which meets the requirements of the attached statement of work.  All projects shall be completed within 45 calendar days after issuance of a task order (to include the required pre-survey meeting through the post-survey meeting and submission of final survey deliverables to the NRCS office) unless the order states otherwise.  


SELECTION CRITERIA: 
Firms which meet the requirements described are invited to submit one original and three (3) copies of the attached Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications (completing both Part I and II).  Firms who have recently completed a SF 330, and have confirmed with the NRCS office that it is still on file, need not resubmit an SF 330.  However, should an offeror want to update the form a new one can be submitted and it will replace the one on file.

All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in no order of importance and all are equally important. 

1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. 
The Surveyor must be a licensed registered land surveyor in the State of Minnesota. Evaluation will include the level of formal education, the number of years licensed, and involvement in professional activities/organizations.

2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required
Evaluation will be based on knowledge of local survey practices, records research, experience in conducting rural or conservation easement boundary surveys, and the approach used on previous surveys to solve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.

3. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required performance time.
Evaluation will be based on ability to accomplish multiple work orders to completion within performance time stipulated in the statement of work and the ability to add personnel and/or consultants to complete work on time.  Due to the nature of the easement programs surveying work tends to be seasonal and multiple delivery orders can be issued in a short period of time.  The resultant solicitation and contract will stipulate limitations for the vendors obligation to perform and the governments obligation (maximum quantity) to order requirements for a given area.  Vendors should especially focus on articulating how requirements up to the limit will be fulfilled in the required time, as well as plans for addressing quantities of surveys over the maximum limit.  Evidence must be convincing and well articulated. 

4. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry.
Evaluation will be based on the firms past experience with other government agencies and the private section in performing the requirements described; cost control, quality, and timeliness of performance under previous contracts. References with name and telephone numbers must be provided.

5. Location in the general geographic area and knowledge of the locality of the project area
Evaluation will be based upon the firms location to the geographic area for each of the award areas for which they wish to be considered and knowledge of the locality of the project.  For firms outside the general project area(s), provide a plan to provide service in a cost effective manner. Firms must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed for each area..

6.  Demonstrated experience with similar types of projects in the State of Minnesota within the last five (5) years.  
Evaluation will be based on the firms experience in having conducted similar legal boundary surveys in the State of Minnesota within the last five (5) years. 

Use Section H of Part I of the SF 330 to provide relevant information regarding the above six (6) factors, if not adequately addressed in another section of the SF 330.

For each of the eight (8) planned awards, firms will be ranked from most to least qualified.  A request for proposal will be requested from the most qualified firm for each planned award and negotiations will be conducted to arrive at a fair and reasonable fee rate schedule that will be used to price individual task orders.  If a mutually acceptable price cannot be negotiated, negotiations will be terminated and the process will be repeated with the next highest ranked firm, and so on, and so forth, with the next if acceptable pricing cannot be negotiated. 

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov. It is also required that all contractors be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration in ORCA, contact the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov. This is NOT a Request for Proposals but a Request for Qualifications. 


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: 
All responsible firms that meet the requirements described herein, and wish to be considered, must submit an original and three copies of the complete package.  OFFERORS MUST INDICATE THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA(S) THEY WISH TO BE CONSIDERED. The package must be received at the following address: ATTN: Todd Davis, Contracting Officer, USDA-NRCS, 375 Jackson Street, Suite 600, St. Paul MN 55101.

<DESC>This is a MODIFICATION to the Special Notice published on 6/1/10.   Meeting for Low Cost Guided Imaging Rocket (LOGIR) Technology Demonstration Project, herein after called LOGIR Day.  This notice is being posted under solicitation number N68936-10-R-0054.  The Department of the Navy (DON) is hosting the LOGIR Day 0800 - 1500 on 30 June 2010.  The purpose of LOGIR Day is to disseminate information to defense industry regarding the final project accomplishments in the Science & Technology (S&T) phase; results of recent live fire tests; and improve industry understanding of the Government technology efforts.
Background:  LOGIR is a surface warfare (SUW) capability directed at countering the Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC) threat and consists of a helicopter launch platform with its associated targeting system, a smart launcher, and guided precision rocket. The guided rocket consists of a Guidance and Control (G&C) section mated to a 2.75 inch Hydra-70 rocket motor with a M151 warhead.  The G&C system provides inertial mid-course guidance with imaging infrared (IIR) terminal homing.  The system provides dramatically improved capability to engage FIAC due to improved range and short target engagement timelines, both of which reduce pilot exposure.  It does so at a low cost that permits adequate procurement for use in the field as well as for training.
 Visit Request:  This meeting will be unclassified.  Participants who plan to attend must have a valid visit request on file with Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake Security Division, (Code N21NPW).

Is the purpose to propose a model or to conduct a full quantitative test of a model? Or both?<BR><BR>Obviously there needs to be a model for there to be antecedent and outcome variables, the extent to which a theoretical model is developed will allow for effort (see question #2, below) to be expended on literature searches, coding, and analysis. <BR><BR>However, there is a balance between an intricate and possible low effect size per tested correlation and a more elegant, statistically powerful model.  Successful papers will show an understanding of this balancing process.  <BR><BR>2) Is there an anticipated level of effort for this work?<BR><BR>The Contractor Manpower Effort is approximately .25<BR>

<DESC><p><br />This is a sources sought notice and is not a request for proposal or bid. The intent of this sources sought notice is to determine if there small businesses that are qualified and capable of performing IT Production services at a fair market price for the U.S. Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM's) anticipated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Production - Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) contract. The USSOCOM Special Operations Research, Development, and Acquisition Center (SORDAC) in Tampa, FL, is seeking a Capability Statement from all qualified Small Businesses contractors.</p>
<p>The TACLAN Program provides Special Operational Forces (SOF) operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced automated data processing and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. TACLAN provides the automation infrastructure and common-user applications to interconnect deployed SOF headquarters, main operating locations, tactical teams and liaison elements. Numerous joint, service, and SOF deployed automation programs/efforts operate on TACLAN to gain connectivity to SOF Information Environment (SIE) networks. TACLAN merges numerous deployed SOF automation efforts into a consolidated infrastructure program consisting of hardware and SOF validated software applications. The TACLAN program includes, but is not limited to,TACLAN Suites, Mission Planning Kits (MPKs) and Field Computing Devices (FCDs). Each TACLAN Suite consists of three easily transportable, multiple integrated networks; 60 general use laptops; 10 intelligence laptops; routers; and ancillary equipment used by SOF Command and Control Nodes, forming a deployed Local Area Network (LAN). MPKs consist of four general use laptops and ancillary equipment used by SOF teams for detailed mission planning support. FCDs are small handheld computing devices used by the most forward deployed SOF teams to automatically interface with the TACLAN suite via tactical communications.</p>
<p>At a summary level, the anticipated scope for the TACLAN Production acquisition includes:</p>
<p>* Production<br />-- Program Planning and Management<br />-- Product Design, Fabrication, Integration<br />-- Systems Engineering and Technical Support<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Market research<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; White papers<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Analysis, testing, recommendations, and implementation of new technology<br />-- Software Integration<br />-- Test and Evaluation<br />-- Configuration Management<br />-- Information Assurance/Security Accreditation<br />-- Quality Assurance<br />-- Meeting/Conference Support</p>
<p>* Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)<br />-- ILS Plan<br />-- Product Procurement<br />-- Technical and Sustainment Support<br />-- Warranty<br />-- Provisioning and Spares<br />-- Technical Manuals<br />-- Training (New Equipment Training and Sustainment Training)<br />-- Fielding and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) Support; Fielding Plans, Disposal Plans<br />-- Software Licensing/Maintenance</p>
<p>* Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the TACLAN contractor will provide all personnel, facilities, materials, equipment, software and services necessary to perform the tasks outlined above. The TACLAN contractor must possess a Top Secret facility clearance and personnel cleared up to the TS/SCI level.</p>
<p>USSOCOM's current TACLAN Production contract (H92222-08-D-0017) expires<br />31 March 2011. The Government anticipates a single, small business set aside contract for the C4I Production - TACLAN contract. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is anticipated to be 541519 (Other Computer Related Services), with a small business size standard of 150 employees. If you believe a different NAICS Code is more appropriate please provide the recommended NAICS code and supporting rationale.</p>
<p>All interested Small Businesses with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit a CAPABILITY STATEMENT consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and brochures which should include:</p>
<p>1) Firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.<br />2) Identification of the type of Small Businesses (i.e., SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.).<br />3) Past experience with IT Production work. Describe completed IT Production projects that are similar in size and scope to the<br />proposed TACLAN Product project, the percentage of self-performed work, how the project was accomplished and performance rating<br />for the work.<br />4) Letter from bonding agency indicating your performance and payment bond capacity.<br />5) A statement verifying that you will perform a minimum of 51% of the work IAW FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting<br />and how it will be accomplished.</p>
<p>The CAPABILITIES STATEMENT for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein. Any existing marketing material may also be submitted with the CAPABILITIES STATEMENT.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages (title/cover page and table of contents are not included in the 10 page limit). Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The Government will NOT notify respondents of the results of the evaluation. The Government will not consider statements that do not meet all requirements or that are not submitted within the allotted time. The Government will only accept electronic submissions. Responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis should be e-mailed to contracting@socom.mil, Attn: Dr. Joseph R. Daum. Please include "TACLAN Small Business Sources Sought Notice Response" in the e-mail subject line. Responses must be received no later than Friday, June 11, 2010 at 4:00pm EST.</p>

The period of performance is for three (3) months from the effective date of award.
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Objective Review entitled "(BHPr) Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals (EETHP) - Pre-Doctoral Training Field Reader Review." These services include pre-review, review, and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded a Cost Reimbursement Task Order to Humanitas, Inc., under the IDIQ Contract No. HHSH250200976001I, in the amount of $7,130.17. The period of performance is for three (3) months from the effective date of award.
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Objective Review entitled "(BHPr) Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals (EETHP) - Graduate Psychology Education Field Reader Review." These services include pre-review, review, and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009.</p>

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  Equipment, West Point Lake, Georgia<br><br>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Anderson Construction Company, W9178-06-C-0003<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is responsible for the inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings, structures, and roads in 31 recreation areas, three operations areas, and the Project Management Office; 2) The scheduling, coordination, quality control and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen circumstance encountered during the job; 3) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed, restricting  public access to camping and recreation areas. <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  BW&T/Alabama Coosa Project, Tuscaloosa, Alabama<br><br>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services,Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already performing the work under a previous modification.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  The amount and type of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on management of water levels and flows.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


SUBJECT: Variable Speed Drives Installation
         

The following justification and approval is made regarding the procurement of services to install Variable Speed Drives (VSD) for the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS).  This is a sole source procurement and competitive procedures will not be used. The format for this justification is from the FAR part 6.303-2 and presented in the format prescribed.	
         
 As required of FAR 6.303-2, the following information is provided for this procurement.
 
1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "justification for other than full and open competition."

Agency: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
Contracting Activity: Contracting Officer (90C)
 Central Texas Veterans Health Care System 
1901 Veterans Memorial Drive. 
Temple, Texas   76504

2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  
The contractor shall supply all component parts and install a variable speed drive (VSD) on a chiller located at the CTVHCS, Temple Texas. 

3. A description of the supplies or services required in order to meet the agencies needs (including the estimated value).

The installation of the VSD with its ancillary components will allow the chiller to operate more efficiently, resulting in reduced energy use/costs and will extend the useful life of the chillers. The estimated value of this procurement is $96,051.00

4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 

The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source.

5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 

Building automation and control system software including VSD installations are most often implemented to avoid incorporating multiple systems. Maintenance personnel have problems maintaining a variety of different systems and ensuring that the latest versions of software are utilized. The problem of multiple control systems is that it complicates efficient control of the HVAC system and escalates government maintenance cost in later years. When the system is a multi vendor system, for the most part it is not understood by VA maintenance personnel and it is always abandoned in default position and not operated optimally. The result is inefficient operation and energy reduction and cost savings are not achieved.
Johnson Controls is the only known source able to provide the required variable speed drives to support the current Metasys system utilized at the Temple VA.  Maintenance of the Metasys system is provided by Johnson Controls under contract VA257-P-0070.  During the solicitation and subsequent award of the maintenance contract Johnson Controls Inc was the only offeror submitting a proposal.   Award was made IAW FAR 6.301, Only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements.   
6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

During market research it became apparent that distributors could not provide component parts and installation without sub-contracting from Johnson Controls. No sources will be contacted other than Johnson Controls. IAW FAR 6.302-1 (C) ii supplies have been deemed to be available from the original source, Johnson Controls.  It is likely that solicitation and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.

7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

This requirement is a sole source to Johnson Controls, a Large Business. The offorers proposed price has been determined fair and reasonable  IAW FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii) comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items.

8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 

Market research was conducted by searching the internet. During this search it was determined that the component parts to be installed by Johnson Control are available through distributors but these distributors are unable to provide installation or any warranties.  

9. Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition.

Full and open competition would not meet the specific needs of this acquisition due to the proprietary nature of the equipment to be procured. The government would not be able to release clearly defined specifications as the information that would be necessary for release would be proprietary information regarding the Johnson Controls products. 

10. A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None

11. A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 

Any subsequent acquisitions for similar products would probably have to be procured from Johnson Control unless the CTVHCS installs a new system produced by one or more manufacturers. 

  
12. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that this procurement action is made in good faith with regard for the public interest.
