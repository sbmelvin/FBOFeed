<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR RARE EARTH MAGNET PRODUCTION.  This is a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis; not a request for competitive proposals.  The purpose of this program is to investigate the current and potential market for the entire rare earth magnet manufacturing value chain to include the mining, processing and production of rare earth raw materials to be used as feedstock in the development and manufacture of rare earth magnets.  The Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) intends to award an Assistance Instrument or a contract, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Molycorp, Inc., 67750 Bailey Rd, Mountain Pass, CA 92366.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to determine the market requirements for the entire domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing value chain and to determine what action, if any, will be required to meet future rare earth magnet requirements for critical defense applications and technologies.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 6 to 9 months.  A description of the task is as follows:  Develop a detailed strategic business plan that 1) formally assesses and verifies the military and commercial demand for the entire rare earth magnet manufacturing value chain and 2) documents a formal plan to establish and expand domestic capabilities for rare earth ore mining and refinement, coupled with production of high-performance rare earth magnets.  The ability of the offeror to conduct this technical analysis and study and accomplish the goals of the program will be assessed based upon the offeror?s demonstrated leadership in the industry and the offeror?s capability to provide all key aspects (mining, refining, magnet production) of the entire rare earth magnet value chain.  In addition, the offeror shall demonstrate an ability and willingness to meet the challenges of successfully developing production for evolving DoD requirements.  These challenges include (a) identification, analysis and evaluation of the enabling technologies and (b) reduction of cycle-time and costs for rare earth ore mining and high-performance magnet production.  Additional phases to establish, maintain, or expand a domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing capability may be awarded, and will be based on defense requirements, anticipated demand, and availability of funding.  The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR6.302-1(a)(1), ?Only One Responsible Source? or ?DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400(b),? based upon their domestic R&D activity and on their experience as a merchant industrial supplier providing leading edge technology, as well as an assessment of the program risk to the Government.  Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offeror?s area of expertise and experience.  It shall include a demonstrated capability to manufacture the entire rare earth magnet value chain.  In addition, the documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a merchant industrial supplier along with market share in each area.  The documentation shall identify relevant past, present and future research along with information on research budgets, personnel, and facilities.  The offeror shall document their experience in transitioning product from R&D to production.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement.  Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any information received for this Notice of Contract Action will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

SUBPART 5301.91 -- OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose.
The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to consider concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight, and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. 
5301.9102 Policy.
(a) MAJCOM and DRU commanders shall appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their MAJCOM/DRU. For AFMC and AFSPC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. 
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g. administrative support, independent review teams). 
(c) Contracting officers shall identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP. 
(d) The ombudsman shall: 
(1) Act neutrally to facilitate resolution of issues or concerns raised by concerned parties; 
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the concerned party, and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority); 
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the commander, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; for AFMC and AFSPC centers, report only to the Center Commander, Laboratory Commander, or PEO; and for other MAJCOM/DRUS, report only to the MAJCOM CC or PEO;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of $2,500, consistent with the procedures in the contract; 
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by concerned parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes. 
(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, or those having Air Force wide implications. 
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts.
*****
5305.207 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopsis 

(20) In all synopsis announcing competitive or sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer shall indicate that the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable.

OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

SUBPART 5301.91 -- OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose.
The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to consider concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight, and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. 
5301.9102 Policy.
(a) MAJCOM and DRU commanders shall appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their MAJCOM/DRU. For AFMC and AFSPC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. 
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g. administrative support, independent review teams). 
(c) Contracting officers shall identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP. 
(d) The ombudsman shall: 
(1) Act neutrally to facilitate resolution of issues or concerns raised by concerned parties; 
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the concerned party, and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority); 
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the commander, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; for AFMC and AFSPC centers, report only to the Center Commander, Laboratory Commander, or PEO; and for other MAJCOM/DRUS, report only to the MAJCOM CC or PEO;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of $2,500, consistent with the procedures in the contract; 
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by concerned parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes. 
(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, or those having Air Force wide implications. 
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts.
*****
5305.207 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopsis 

(20) In all synopsis announcing competitive or sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer shall indicate that the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable.

This specific component has gone through the shock and vibration testing required for certification of its safety for shipboard installation.  Purchase of any other manufacturer's component would require duplication of the shock and vibration testing performed on these UPS at a cost estimated to exceed the cost of the computers being procured.  Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase these Powerstar UPS.  These items will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving !

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 
DESIGN-BUILD CLUB/VQ/JOINT OPS FACILITY, HURLBURT FIELD, FL



Description

The 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron is conducting market research and as such is requesting information from industry about the potential impact of phasing a multi-building construction project anticipated for Hurlburt Field, FL in the summer of 2007.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bid, a solicitation, or an indication that the US Air Force or Hurlburt Field will contract for the items contained in this RFI.  The Air Force will not pay respondents for information provided in response to the RFI.  This RFI is being conducted to determine the potential cost impact of phasing the two separate buildings planned for the complex currently sited for property bordering Santa Rosa Sound, which is located across US Highway 98 from Hurlburt Field main base.  The Club/Visiting Quarters (VQ) project will be constructed as a single facility and will total approximately 69,216 square feet.  The club will exist of a kitchen, dining rooms, lounge, ballrooms, bathrooms, and office space.  The VQ will be designed to lodge 120 guests.  The Joint Operations Planning Facility (JOPF) will be approximately 18,002 square feet and will contain an auditorium and separate briefing rooms.  The JOPF is planned for an adjacent site to the Club/VQ project.  The anticipated site for the JOPF is where the current Hurlburt Field Soundside Club is located.  The existing club will have to be demolished before construction of the JOPF can commence.  The Air Force requests information from industry on any potential cost impact (% increase in cost of phasing) of delaying construction of the JOPF until the Club/VQ is complete and functioning.  Please provide explanation of any cost impacts anticipated.  All responses should be directed to Chris Wentworth and emailed to Chris.Wentworth@hurlburt.af.mil or faxed to (850) 884-1272.  All responses are requested to be submitted by close of business on December 22, 2006.

The flotation ensemble incorporates performance improvements over the current in-service flotation device, the LPU-32/P.  HESP will provide increased buoyancy and will integrate with the currently fielded Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and the new Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) and its single point release system.  The emergency air bottle and survival items are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and will not be part of the procurement.  The Government intends to award a single contract which will cover a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for the supplies and services anticipated herein is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing; the Federal Supply Code is 4220, Marine Lifesaving and Diving Equipment. The projected procurement quantity is 19,839 HESP units over the potential 5 year period, plus the associated documentation. The type of contract to be awarded shall be Firm Fixed Price, and the required delivery of these units shall be not greater than 4 months after award/exercise of option at an approximate average rate of 400 per month. Deliveries shall be received at designated government facilities throughout CONUS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE ISLIP LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK WAS CANCELLED.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) intends to acquire services for the visual survey of Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) host trees using tree climbers and bucket trucks within the State of New Jersey and the State of New York.  These services will cover the NJ infestation in Middlesex/Union Counties and the NY infestation in Islip Long Island, NY.  The contiguous survey area in NJ covers approximately 16.4 square miles within the cities/municipalities of Rahway, Linden, Carteret, and the Avenel Section of Woodbridge Township.  There are approximately 38,000 ALB host trees within this area with an average dbh of 10 inches.  In NY, the contiguous survey area located in Islip Long Island covers approximately 7 miles square miles with an estimated number of 76,000 ALB host trees with an average dbh of 10 inches.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Mimosa, Hackberry, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Visual surveys using tree climbers and bucket trucks to perform the inspections are a vital component to the success of the ALB Eradication Program.  USDA is looking to accomplish two goals through these survey contracts:  1) Detect all ALB infested trees in order to eliminate the infestation as quickly as possible and 2)  Confirm eradication by accomplishing repeated negative surveys on all ALB host trees within the targeted areas.  This is a firm fixed price, completion contract anticipated for 12 months beginning October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006 with unilateral options up to four years to extend the effective period.  It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $6.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about August 8, 2005, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer by September 9, 2005.

<SOLNBR>06SP340020
<ARCHDATE>12042007
<CONTACT>Virginia Toledo Contract Specialist 9283438136     ;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), has a requirement for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP), O&M of the WQIC Research Facility (WQIC); and the Operation of the Analytical Laboratory (ALS) located at 7301Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona. The YDP is one of the world's largest reverse osmosis desalting plants.  Its full capacity is 72 million gallons per day.  Though the main plant is not currently operating, it is maintained in state of readiness that varies according to Government requirements.  The contractor will be required to provide all contract management, planning, supervision, administration, personnel, operation, engineering support, labor, chemicals, services and transportation necessary to perform all aspects of the contract requirement.  The government will provide the bulk of tools, equipment, supplies, materials, and facilities. The WQIC is a designated National Center for Water Treatment Technology, a nation-wide affiliation of publicly-funded water treatment research facilities that partner with the public for testing. The National Water Research Institute, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Army sponsor the National Centers Program. The goal of the National Centers Program is to promote improved water-treatment processes through united research efforts by government, academia, and private industry. There are currently only seven National Centers in the U.S., and each center explores different water research focus areas.  The Analytical Laboratory supports the YDP, WQIC and other Government authorized operations of the YAO by performing chemical, biological, and physical tests; and preparing the data for engineering and data reporting. The mission of the WQIC is to advance the development and transfer of water purification technologies at its state-of-the-art facility through field tests, hands-on training, and implementation. The varying levels of research focus on the following research goals: (1) analytical laboratory services for YDP and the YAO; (2) to reduce the cost to operate and maintain the YDP; (3) securing safe, clean water supplies for the West now and in the future; and (4) transferring federally-developed technology to the public pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986.  The WQIC also provides a water supply for the YAO.   The government anticipates that a single award will be made (YDP, WQIC and ALS).  The selected contractor must exhibit extensive experience in reverse osmosis (RO) desalting, providing licensed analytical laboratory service, and in advanced water treatment experience including (1) Administration; (2) Operations; (3) Maintenance; and (4) Engineering support. The proposed requirement will contain a combination of firm fixed price (for the basic O&M requirement), cost reimbursement, Fixed Labor-Hour, and Time and Material CLINs for IDIQ components under which Task Orders may be issued.  The performance period will have a base year (1year) and four 1 year options.  The Government is responsible for determining the contractor's level of responsibility for each contract year.  The Government, at its option and with notice, may increase or decrease the level of responsibility to achieve a desired level of support in accordance with the SOW. This solicitation will be completed on a full and open competition basis.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 221310 (Water Supply and Irrigation Systems) and the related small business size standard is $6.5 Million.  The estimated price range of this project for the base year is between $3 and $5 Million.  The solicitation, in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 06SP340020 will be available at the link provided in this notice or check our website http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The solicitation will be available on or about January 15, 2007 with offers due forty five (45) days after issuance of the solicitation.  Offerors should visit the web site after January 15, 2007 in order to access the solicitation and any subsequent amendments and/or notices. Hard copies of this solicitation will not be available. The solicitation will be issued electronically via FedbizOpps web site and will be available electronically on a CD upon written request. Effective October 1, 1997, contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.ccr.gov.   Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  The CCR Handbook and information on the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.    Offerors will be required to complete the annual representation and certification electronically via the Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bnp.gov.

<RESPDATE>121506
<CONTACT>Lilia West, Contracting Officer, Phone 415-522-3152, Fax 415-522-3114, Email lilia.west@gsa.gov
<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR SAN LUIS 2
SOLICITATION NO. GS-09P-06-KTC-3062
STAGE 1 - DESIGN/BUILD OF THE NEW SAN LUIS COMMERCIAL BORDER STATION IN SAN LUIS, ARIZONA


QUESTION 1
Is permanent modular building construction acceptable or conventional preferred?  Also, what is estimated construction duration (days) to complete this project.  Any additional information you can provide is greatly appreciated.

ANSWER 1
?	Modular type construction would be acceptable as long as it still met the Design Excellence requirements that will be explained in further detail in the RFP package in Stage 2.  
?	Award of the contract is anticipated to be April 2007.  The design build contract has a partial completion period of September 2009.   The final completion is scheduled for January 2010. 

QUESTION 2
This preliminary SFO refers to ?tenants? is this a lease-back situation? Or will the government own in fee?

ANSWER 2
The building will be owned by the government and be leased out to the tenants.

QUESTION 3
Has the RFP been issued for this project?

ANSWER 3
No, it will be issued in January 2007 only to the firms short-listed in the Stage 1 RFQ process.

QUESTION 4
Can you give me the name and phone number of the architect or your engineer on staff that is handling the bridging documents?

ANSWER 4
There are no bridging documents for this project.  As a Design/Build project, the architect is required to be part of the Design/Build Team.  It is a true design/build project in which only program requirements will be given to the short-listed Design/Build Teams to put together their proposed design concept for the project.

QUESTION 5
Will this facility house detainees in rooms that will require electronic door controls, intercoms, duress alarms, etc?

ANSWER 5
The port of entry will require some space to accommodate holding cells and the required security equipment to support the holding cells and their operation.

QUESTION 6
Is this the first design-build solicitation for such a design excellence facility (meaning have there been no other similar design-build opportunities in the past for ports or entry, but rather only design-bid-build opportunities?)

ANSWER 6
Yes, at least in Region 9

QUESTION 7
Is GSA open to accelerated construction alternatives in the design-build approach (tilt-up, panelized, modular, and other forms of manufactured solutions that speed delivery and cut costs while meeting all other project requirements?

ANSWER 7
Yes, we are open to such methods as long as these types meet the program requirements of the facility; and as stated in Question 1, as long as the facility meets the Design Excellence requirements.

QUESTION 8
Regarding the subject solicitation, can I get a plan holders list?  Also, will you be posting the attendance list and the Q&A notes from the pre-submittal meeting last week?

ANSWER 8
The RFQ pre-submittal conference minutes, attendance and questions were posted to the FedBizOpps website:  www.fedbizopps.com on November 21, 2006.

QUESTION 9
In regards to the new commercial border station in San Luis, AZ (Sol. # GS-09P-06-KTC-3062), is this project open to modular construction?

ANSWER 9
Refer to answer in Question 7.

QUESTION 10
Will this project be utilizing Modular Office Trailers at all?  We have provided many trailers to the site, and I was wondering if there will be additional needs?

ANSWER 10
The requirements for this facility should be met within the building facilities themselves that are planned.  The use of modular trailers would not be expected except for any needs the selected Design/Build Team may have to accommodate their on site staff, etc. for the construction of the project since no structures currently exist on the site.

QUESTION 11
I represent a manufacturer of security systems i.e. metal detectors and x-ray scanners.  I am trying to find out about the San Luis and Yuma, AZ proposed Border Building facilities.  I would like to know how I get more information on this project i.e. will it use equipment like mine?  Who do I talk to specifically in this regard? And what is time frame? Stage of Project?

ANSWER 11
We would recommend you first start with the FedBizOpps website at fedbizopps.gov to get the project announcement and Amendment 1 that has been issued to date.  You should also contact Lilia West by e-mail at lilia.west@gsa.gov to request the RFQ package that has been issued to all interested parties.  

QUESTION 12

Original Notice.  P.2 -Par. 5 Refers to design documents to be provided.

Are there existing preliminary plans, and if so, what stage are they?

ANSWER 12

NONE



QUESTION 13

Original Notice.  P.2/Par.5 - Refers to stipend for design

What is the amount of stipend to be paid to design team?

ANSWER 13


A stipend of $25,000.00 will be provided to each of the shortlisted firms who will meet the required criteria outlined in the RFP.

QUESTION 14

Will you confirm that our qualifications response should only contain the following:

	a.  Cover Letter
	b.  Table of Contents
	c.   SF 330
	d.  Appendix for past performance questionnaires A& B (key personnel & D/B team)
	e.  Bonding Letter

ANSWER 14

The qualifications response should contain all the above.  The Standard Form 330 has sections for resumes of key personnel, project experience, company information, personnel/project matrix plus "Additional Information" sheet.  An interactive version is available from the GSA Forms website:  

http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?viewType=DETAIL&formId=21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6

The limit of 2 each 8-1/2 x 11 sheets for project experience would be satisfied with the use of two more additional sheet.

The offerors will be allowed to use two additional pages to describe their project experience.  The SF330 requests all of the information that is to be provided for the RFQ submittal; it could serve in either capacity within the main submittal or be put in the Appendix section of the submittal.

QUESTION 15

Does the 50 page limit include all the components listed above (a-e) or only the SF330?

ANSWER 15

Refer to Answer # 14 and to page 10 of the RFQ.


QUESTION 16

May we answer all the RFQ questions using the SF 330? IE:  SF330 Section D for the Organizational Chart; Section E for team member resumes;  Section F for projects and Section H for all the other questions asked such as proposed project management structure, interactions with GSA during design and construction, time control systems, etc. (found on page 13 of the RFQ)

ANSWER 16

Provide answers to all of the RFQ questions using the SF330.  If you need more space, you may use to more additional sheets as indicated under Answer 14.




QUESTION 17

On pages 10 and 11 of the RFQ, the GSA requests a list of a minimum of three (3) similar projects (part 1; page 10) and three (3) but no more than five (5) design build projects (part 2; page 11)  Could you confirm that we should:

	a.  ONLY provide this project information for our D/B in a SF 330, Section F project sheet?
	And can we ONLY provide FIVE (5) projects in the SF 330 or may we include up to ten (1) as normally specified in an SF330?  Our thought is to provide five (5) similar projects plus five (5) D/B projects.

ANSWER 17

Refer to Answers provided for Question 14 and Question 16.


QUESTION 18

Can we use Performance Evaluations for some projects that were previously filled out by clients for other GSA pursuits?

ANSWER 18

YES

QUESTION 19
A modification  was issued that indicated that an SF330 is to be provided to fulfill the response requirements.  Are we still required to provide Appendix A (Past Performance/Key personnel Questionnaire) and Appendix B (Past Performance Projects or should we disregard?

ANSWER 19

Yes, you are still required to provide Appendix A(Past Performance/Key Personnel Questionnaire) and Appendix B (Past Performance Projects).

DESCRIPTION:  This is an unrestricted procurement. There is no solicitation to download.  Architect/Engineer (A/E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Renovation/Repair and New Construction of Facilities. The work for this contract shall occur at various Navy and Marine Corps facilities and other government facilities located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.  The preponderance of the work is in California.  
Required services are for Engineering Studies and Site Investigation Reports to support new development on raw land, or re-development of existing developed sites; preparation of Requests for Proposals (RFP) for Design-Build Projects; preparation of fully designed plans and specifications for Invitation for Bid (IFB) projects; other engineering designs, studies, reports, cost estimates, evaluations, and construction support services.  
The general scope of this contract includes the preparation of designs, drawings, specifications, and design-build Request for  Proposal (RFP) packages for repair, renovation and minor construction, demolition and new construction at various facilities, such as, but not limited to, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters, Food Services facilities, Fitness Centers, Laboratories, Training Facilities, Industrial Facilities, Stores, etc.  Services shall include design of interior and exterior alterations and repair incorporating the coordination of various architectural-engineering disciplines, and the differing aspects of phasing of construction that involve occupied and unoccupied facilities for the purpose of providing construction documentation.  An integrated project design approach shall incorporate sustainable design elements that will lead to substantial improvements in life-cycle operations and reduce life-cycle costs. Task orders may require the preparation of supporting engineering documentation, including Site Investigations, General Landscape and Irrigation, Designs, Cost Estimates, and Economic Analyses to develop and define actual costs of construction projects, including special costs for Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems, Anti Terrorism, utilities, seismic reinforcement analysis, Blast analysis and structural investigation, and geo-technical engineering requirements.

Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.  Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods.  Each performance period will run 365 calendar days, or until the maximum dollar limit is reached, whichever occurs first.  If the dollar capacity of the previous period has not been utilized, this unused capacity will be added to the subsequent option period (if it is exercised).  The hourly rates will be negotiated for each calendar (12 month period) year and are independent of which option year is in effect.  The government may exercise the option period unilaterally.  Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise.  The estimated start date is March 2007.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance,  will be used to determine whether proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -including the innovative approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation; (2) Related Experience - the extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - the extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness; (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any); and (5) Soundness of proposed technology transition approach.   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.


VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Necessary Clearances:  The majority of the work to be performed will be at TOP SECRET; however, a portion of work may be performed at collateral SECRET. Work to be performed will require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  Key personnel identified for assignment to the PANACIA effort must have an active TOP SECRET clearance at the time of award and be cleared for access to SI/TK information within three (3) months after award. A principal investigator clause may be required on this effort.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE):   Government-provided information for the PANACIA contractor(s) (for use under this program) will be posted on the website.  The necessary hardware required for the software integration into the AFRL Fusion Facility and targeted transition facilities will be provided as Base Support.  However, the PANACIA contractors shall be required to provide hardware at their own facility for architecture development and integration during the contract period-of-performance.  This hardware shall be compatible with the targeted facilities. No GFE will be provided to the PANACIA contractors for development use in their facility. The PANACIA offerors shall specify, and provide if awarded, any reference image or display background required for the geo-registration/time synchronization for the fusion of multiple intelligence data types.  Other required GFI data shall be specified in the proposal for evaluation.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of AFRLs web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. (To be discussed at Bidder's Briefing)

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Brian Romano, telephone: (315) 330-4218 or email Brian.Romano@rl.af.mil.

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail  Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil

<DESC>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FROM PROPERTY OWNERS TO PROVIDE A BUILDING SITE IN THE AREA OF THE CITY OF TUCSON, ARIZONA

The Federal Government is seeking expressions of interests from current property owners or their authorized brokers for a no-cost assignable option to purchase land for a building site.  The Government selected developer will exercise the option at the negotiated purchase price.  

To receive consideration, the property must lie within the following boundaries:  22nd Street and Starr Pass Boulevard on the South; Mission Road, South Grande Avenue and North Grande Avenue to the west; West Speedway Boulevard to the north; and North Euclid Avenue, South Euclid Avenue and South Park Avenue to the east.

The site must be strategically located for the operational needs of a federal agency.   Zoning of adjacent properties and master planning of the general area should be compatible with the proposed project.  The property must have easy access to major freeways but not be adjacent to overpasses, bridges, elevated ramps or railroad tracks. Sites should have adequate electrical power, sanitary sewer, water, telephone, cable TV and fiber optics available, or easily accessible.  

Any property submitted for consideration must be relatively flat and consist of approximately 5 - 7 contiguous buildable acres and located outside of any designated 100 year floodplain.  The property should not have any easements or right-of-ways encroaching on the secured portion of the site or reducing the site's usable area. 

A current preliminary title report and any existing Phase I environmental site assessment reports, boundary surveys, soil reports, geotechnical reports, cultural resources reports or other pertinent data must accompany each expression of interest.  In addition, all submittals must include a representation of the agent's authority to tender the offer on behalf of the current fee owner.

The federal government will determine how to develop the site and hereby notifies all interested parties that we may consider properties other than those offered in response to this advertisement.  The Government will require the land to be delivered in fee ownership and will not entertain offers of a ground lease.  

Offerors should submit expressions of interest by mail or facsimile no later than close of business on December 30, 2006.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 2, Upstate NY, to support its mission, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Biomerieux for D-Dimer Testing Methods. This proposed contract action is for Quantitative D-Dimer, an Elisa method, the gold standard clinically, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 603.2. The VA believes that Biomerieux is the only company that can provide the specific testing method (ELISA) desired. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements for the desired testing method. Information may be sent to the Contracting Office, VA Medical Center, Albany, NY. 12208. Responses received will be evaluated. However, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Biomerieux.  Responses are due by Thursday, December 28, 2006 9am Eastern time.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is in the planning stage of seeking interested vendors that have novel counter sniper capabilities that can detect and locate, prevent, engage, or protect against enemy sniper activities for testing during the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratorys (MCWL) Counter Sniper experiments.  MCWL is interested in identifying equipment and technical support available for bailment and potential purchase to support technical demonstrations and experimentation to develop the tactics, techniques and procedures needed to combat the ongoing sniper threat in theatre.  The government is focused primarily on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items that can be easily modified to meet existing government requirements to support military experimentation scheduled as: Limited Technical Assessment (LTA):  Date, Location, and Length TBD. Counter Sniper system performance parameters are as follows:   - Must either be able to detect and locate, prevent, engage, or protect against enemy snipers.   - Detection and location can include, but are not limited to, acoustic gunfire detection systems, infrared gunfire detection systems, or optic detection systems.  Detection systems with the capability to suppress, neutralize, or destroy the threat will also be looked at.    - Prevention can include anything that will prevent an enemy sniper from being able to make the shot.   - Engaging can include, but is not limited to, magazine fed, suppressed sniper rifles that enhance our current capabilities.   - Protection can include, but is not limited to, individual protection to areas of the body that the current flak jacket leaves exposed or individual protection while in a stationary position. To facilitate planning efforts, MCWL will host an Industry Day on 8 January 2007 at 0900 in the Gray Research Center Conference Room, 2040 Broadway St., Quantico, VA 22134. The Government will provide an overview of the current enemy sniper situation in Iraq and the requirements for combating this threat. In addition, the Government will schedule, with interested parties, one-on-one meetings tentatively scheduled for the period 16-19 January 2007 at MCWL, Building 3255, Newlin Hall, second floor. The Government desires to meet with technical personnel capable of presenting information that may enhance the capabilities of conducting counter sniper operations.  Please include a technical information package with your presentations.  The Government will not entertain sales, marketing, and/or corporate capability briefs at that time.  Each meeting will last no more than 2 hours.  Due to space limitations, interested parties are requested to limit attendance to no more than 3 peo!  ple.  Interested parties should submit a written response, on corporate letter head, to the following address:  COMMANDING GENERAL, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, Code CTQ029/IDP, ATTN:  Ira D.

<SUBJECT>B -- Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program FY08, Broad Agency Announcement
<DESC>The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as 'Challenge Proposals' proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program.  Evaluations and awards under this BAA will be in compliance with applicable FAR, DFARs and agency regulations.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that 'challenge' an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be at least TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and at TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas will be considered by DAC for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies: 1). Warfighter enhancements that specifically address improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance, et al); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical, et al); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense, et al); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equip, combined equip, longer missions, better batteries, et al). 2). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability, et al); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level, et al); surveillance; and tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification, et al). 3). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level, et al); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight, et al); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training, et al).  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given special consideration if they address the reason for the breach and satisfy all other legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under 'Reference Materials' on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review panels. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption to the acquisition program. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. The acquisition program manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include action as a validation test or a comparative test based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2008 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2007. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil . Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise compensate/ reimburse for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/ submitted via the DAC website NLT 2400 hours EST, 2 February 2007. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the FY2008 templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore will not answer any questions and/ or accept proposals.  Questions regarding DAC should be directed to defensechallenge@osd.mil  or 703-602-3740.

USAFE CSS/SCML

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME:  Cisco Equipment

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity: 

The requiring activity for this action is USAFE CSS/SCML, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action:

The proposed contractual action is for other than full and open competition based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. Request approval to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract to resellers of CISCO equipment.  A firm-fixed price commercial item type contract is planned and will be issued pursuant to FAR 13.5.  The contract is for the purchase of Cisco SONET equipment, required for the network upgrade at the RAF Lakenheath, UK, Technical Control Facility.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services:

Requirement is for the purchase of various Cisco Synchronous Network Equipment (SONET) for the upgrade of the RAF Lakenheath, UK, Technical Control Facility (TCF) Phase II under the HQ USAFE TCF Modernization Program.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority:

10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

5. Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications:

 This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing MAJCOM-wide TCF Modernization Program and will be an extension of previously purchased and installed equipment.  CISCO is required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability, as this equipment is being installed into an existing SONET network.  Additionally,  CISCO SONET is required to be able to work with our existing fiber optic cards which are being supplied from a previous upgrade. If another brand was used there would be the additional cost of the Optical cards.  Furthermore, USAFE/A6 is deploying an enterprise remote monitoring and management solution command-wide, which further justifies the CISCO solution as it allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center to use a single tool to manage all USAFE SONET equipment.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

The synopsis will be combined with the solicitation in accordance with FAR part 12.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price
	
The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of CISCO equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included the evaluation of several technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi, Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timplex to name a few.  The evaluation consisted of personal experiences of USAFE personnel, review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations, an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the CISCO SONET product line as the optical layer multiplexer.

9.  Supporting Facts:

This Brand Name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater. 

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

World Wide Technology, NAS5-02144, 60 Weldon Parkway, Saint Louis, MO 63043, 314-919-1431
Government Micro Resources Inc (GMRI), NAS5-01145, 7403 Gateway Court, Manassas, VA 20109, 800-232-4671

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

No action has been taken to remove barriers to competition. USAFE CSS/SCML must remain with the Cisco product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment. The Government would incur costs in training of personnel and reengineering of non-CISCO equipment for integration with existing equipment as detailed above.  Competition is limited to multiple resellers of CISCO equipment.    

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is  a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Solicitation Number: RFQ 618-93-07-lw.  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation  Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-3  - Offer Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items, FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statures or Executive OrdersCommercial Items apply to this solicitation. Subsequent contract is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).   This solicitation document incorporates FAR previsions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-14.  The Contractor is required to provide the software, media, software license, and software maintenance/upgrade and technical support services for the computer software identified herein.  Software maintenance includes periodic updates, enhancements and corrections to the software, and reasonable technical support, all of which are customarily provided by the Contractor to its customers.  Distribution of maintenance copies shall be accomplished by using an appropriate magnetic, electronic or printed media.   Federal law and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), shall govern this Contract.  Commercial license agreements may be made a part of this Contract but only if both parties expressly make them an addendum.  If the commercial license agreement is not made an addendum, it shall not apply, govern, be a part of or have any effect whatsoever on the Contract; this includes, but is not limited to, any agreement embedded in the computer software (clickwrap) or any agreement that is otherwise delivered with or provided to the Government with the commercial computer software or documentation (shrinkwrap), or any other license agreement otherwise referred to in any document.  If a commercial license agreement is made an addendum, only those provisions addressing data rights regarding the Governments use, duplication and disclosure of data (e.g., restricted computer software) are included and made a part of this Contract, and only to the extent that those provisions are not duplicative or inconsistent with Federal law, Federal regulation, the incorporated FAR clauses and the provisions of this Contract, including Addendums A & B; those provisions in the commercial license agreement that do not address data rights regarding the Governments use, duplication and disclosure of data shall not be included or made a part of the Contract.  Federal law and regulation, including without limitation, the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601-613), the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341 et seq.), the Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. 2304), the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, et seq.) and FAR clauses 52.212-4, 52.227-14, 52.227-19 shall supersede, control and render ineffective any inconsistent, conflicting or duplicative provision in any commercial license agreement.  In the event of conflict between this clause and any provision in the Contract or the commercial license agreement or elsewhere, the terms of this clause shall prevail.  Claims of patent or copyright infringement brought against the Government as a party shall be defended by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  28 U.S.C.  516.  At the discretion of DOJ, the Contractor may be allowed reasonable participation in the defense of the litigation.  Any additional changes to the Contract must be made by contract modification (Standard Form 30).  Nothing in this Contract or any commercial license agreement shall be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity.  The Government requires delivery of computer software that does not contain any code that will, upon the occurrence or the nonoccurrence of any event, disable the software.  Such code includes but is not limited to a computer virus, restrictive key, node lock, time-out or other function, whether implemented by electronic, mechanical, or other means, which limits or hinders the use or access to any computer software based on residency on a specific hardware configuration, frequency of duration of use, or other limiting criteria.  If any such code is present, the Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages suffered as a result of a disabling caused by such code, and the Contractor agrees to remove such code upon the Governments request at no extra price to the Government.  Inability of the Contractor to remove the disabling software code will be considered an inexcusable delay and a material breach of the contract, and the Government may exercise its right to terminate for cause.  In addition, the Government is permitted to remove the code as it deems appropriate and charge the Contractor for consideration for the time and effort in removing the code. Under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the Government anticipates entering into sole source procurement for software update and support of an existing Clinical Information System (CIS) with Philips Medical Systems, 3000 Minuteman Road, Andover, MA 01810-1099.

<DESC>Amendment 1 ? Combined/Synopsis; Solicitation No. AG-43ZP-S-07-0006

Subject:  Question and Answers

The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received after the posting of the solicitation.  The solicitation closing date remains unchanged.  All proposal packages are due no later than 2:00 p.m. est. December 15, 2006.


Question 1:  There are 5 categories (A - E) of architectural/engineering services listed in the solicitation, are you awarding 1 contract per specific service type? 

Answer 1: Yes.  The government anticipates awarding a contract for each of the specific service type

Question 2:	Are firms able to proposal on specific service types or do they need to
offer all service types listed? 

Answer 2:  An offeror may offer for the categories in which their firms are
qualified/interested in.  An offorer does not have to have offer for all categories.

Question 3:	Since there are up to 5 contracts being awarded, will the selection
committee consider capable small businesses to fill 1 or more of the contracts?

Answer 3:  Yes.  Small business will be considered for any of the 5 categories. However, 
the procurement is through full and open competition.

Question 4:  I wanted to confirm however if separate contracts are going to be issued for each of the A/E services categories noted.
 
A. Arch. Services, with Engineering Support for Arch. Projects
B. Engineering Services, M/E/P
C. Engineering Services, Struct., Geotech.
D. Landscape Architecture Services, with Civil Engr. Support In-House
E. Engr. Services - Civil, Env., Hazmat
 
Answer 4:  The government anticipates awarding 5 separate contracts.  The government would like for any firm that proposes to do so in the category in which it is best suited.  The government will consider separate proposals from the same firm for more than one category however, awarding five separate contracts is the government?s intent.

Question 5:  What are the limits on the contract for capacity per year and total
contract?

Answer 5:  There are none, other than the size of any given task order, $1/2 million

Question 6:  Is it intended that one submittal/contract cover all 5 service areas, or
should firms submit on each service area separately?

Answer 6:  Submit on each separately.

Question 7:  What US Forest Service computers/systems do we have to be compatible with?

Answer 7:  This is an evaluation criteria.  Minimum:  MS Windows, Word, Excel, AutoCad 2006;  Prefer in addition:  SpecLink, REVIT, Right N, Right Suite, eQuest 

Question 8:  Are you asking for 24 hour emergency response field capability under the
"Environmental" or "HAZMAT" category?

Answer 8:  No

Question 9:  Is the cover letter included in the 100 pages?

Answer 9:  Yes

Question 10:  Is the QA Plan included in the 100-page limit?

Answer 10:  Yes

Question 11:  Do I understand that a separate Part 1 is to be submitted for each
subconsultant or can we blend their quals (projects and resumes, in
particular) into our Part 1? If submitted separately, do they count toward
the 100 pages?

Answer 11:  Separate Part 1 for each subconsultant, but total of 100 pages per team

Question 12:  Do the "innovative forms and patterns in building design" count in the
100-page limit?

Answer 12:  Yes

Question 13:  What do you mean by  "innovative forms"?

Answer 13:   This phrase refers to particularly notable past work done by the offeror, most typically to be illustrated by photographs and/or renderings.  

Question 14:  Do our subcontractors need to register their Reps and Certs online through
the CCR also?

Answer 14:  Please refer to the following and see the last statement:

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration, contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.

The FAR requires that prospective contractors complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with their required registration in the CCR database.  These Annual Representations and Certifications are submitted via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), a part of the Business Process Network (BPN).  To register in ORCA, you need to have an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record, a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN and your CCR records, and know your DUNS number.  Detailed information regarding ORCA and how to submit records is available on the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help and FAQs.  

Any award that is made, the prime contractor will have to be registered in CCR and ORCA.  It is not required for the subcontractors, however, it is highly recommended

 Question 15:   In regard to the Combine Solicitation posted 11/9/06, it is specified that
  you seek landscape architectural services with Civil Engineering Support
  In-house for this RFQ. We are a small landscape architectural firm without
  in-house civil engineering support. Can we qualify by teaming up with a
  Civil Engineering firm that has registered to receive notification?

Answer 15:  The government will consider proposal for landscape architectural with civil engineering support not in house with a teaming arrangement with a qualified civil engineering firm.  
Question 16:  The statement below implies this solicitation for A/E Services is only open to firms within 60 Miles of Atlanta, Georgia.  Is this truly the case?
 ?f.      Location of firm and subcontractors or consultants within the 60 mile radius of Atlanta, Georgia.?
Answer 16:  The statement is an evaluation factor, and does not mean that a firm will be eliminated from considered if they are outside of the 60 mile radius.

Question 17:  Can a firm propose on only one of the categories of services, or does the response need to address all of the potential services and the categories are only an internal reference?  For example, Engineering Services, Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing can be done by my firm in-house, can we just propose for this category?
 
Answer 17:   Yes a firm may propose on only one category, on more than one, or on all depending upon their qualifications as relates to each category.  See answer to question 4 above.

Question 18:    I noticed a firm location is mentioned regarding a 60-mile radius from Atlanta, GA.  Does the prime need to be located within that geographical boundary for consideration?
Answer 18:  See answer 16 above.
Question 19:   The RFQ says that this procurement will be unrestricted and is open to all businesses regardless of size, but then goes on to say that the NAICS code is 541310 (Architectural Services code) with a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts.  Our firm has average annual receipts of around $30 million, so are we eligible for this solicitation based on our average annual receipts?

Answer 19:  The RFQ is unrestricted; it is open to all qualified/interested offeror regardless of size and annual receipts.  Offerors having annual receipts greater than the size standard associated with the NAICS code 541310 may submit their qualifications.

Question 20:  On page 2 of this RFQ, the A-E services being sought under this announcement are listed.  We can fulfill all services except for the geotechnical engineering and hazmat engineering services, which we could provide with sub-consultants, but we would prefer not to have sub-consultants if at all possible so that we are not subject to MBE/WBE/DBE requirements.  Is it possible to submit our qualifications for the services we have available and still be considered for the contract, or do we need to fulfill all of the desired services as listed in the RFQ?

Answer 20:  Yes.  An offeror may submit for only one of the five categories or for all five depending upon qualifications.

Question 21:  If I understand the RFQ correctly, all information that we would like to submit in response to this RFQ must be contained in our SF-330 with a maximum of 100 single sided pages and we are not allowed to submit other materials about our firm.  Please confirm that this is correct.
Answer 21:  The page limitation for submittal of the SF 330 is 100 single sided.

Can you please let me know if there have been any changes or Q&As  regarding the solicitation? A. I plan to post all the Q&A I have so far on PIXS/FedBuzOpps, by COB  today (22 Nov 06). Q.  Section G.  Does G002 Program Manager refer to the Government program  manager, or does G002 refer to the Contractors program manager?? If G002  refers to a Government employee, will that position be approximately  equivalent to a Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTRT)  and, if so, will that individual be located in Sweden or at Wright  Patterson Air Force Base?? A. The G002 PM is the Government PM who is located at WP.  The COTRT will  be located in Sweden and that person is yet to be determined. Q  F 33 - Does item number 9 on the Standard Form 33 contain the correct  due date for receipt of proposals as 1 December 2006, or is the Original  Response Date on the Synopsis to the Solicitation and the Response Date on  the PIXS of November 30, 2006 the correct due date?? Which is the correct  due date?  If this is not cleared up, doesnt it leave the potential for  confusion for any of the bidders participating? A.  The correct date is 1 Dec 2006.  I have corrected the date on PIXS.  Thanks, for catching that. Q.   Amendments 01 and 02 - The amendments are listed at the FedBizOpps  but the link does not reveal the actual documents. Will the Air Force post  these two (2) amendments to the FedBizOpps? A.  The only changes in Amendments 01 & 02 were administrative wording in  the bottom text area. Q. Amendments 01 and 02 - Will the Air Force issue the actual amendments  using Standard Form 30 with attachments as applicable A.     No Q.  Questions and Answers - Will the Air Force post the questions from  offerors and the Governments answer to those questions on the FedBizOpps  for all offerors to read pursuant to FAR 15.201(f) and the Comptroller  General Decision number B-246301, 92-1? A.  I plan to post all the Q&A I have so far in the test area of PIXS by  COB today, 22 Nov 06. Q.  SF 33/Section L - What does the sentence Electronic copies are  acceptable mean? Does the Air Force want to receive proposal by e-mail  only? Or, does the Air Force want the proposals on a CD? Does the Air  Force want the original proposal in hard copy with electronic copies on a  CD? A.  Electronic Copy is any electronic form be it CD, or email, as long as  it is provided to us by COB 1 Dec 06.  Hard copies are also acceptable. Q.  Section B CLIN 0001 - Is the Unit Price and Total Item Amount strictly  limited to the fully burdened price for the personnel labor to the  exclusion of any other type of cost? A.  Section B, CLIN 0001 is not limited to labor.  It should include  anything you need to complete this effort, be it labor, material, etc. but  excluding effort covered in CLIN 0002. Q. Section B - CLIN 0002 - What is the definition of "Mobilization and  Demobilization Support" including what actions are required to be  completed  by the contractor? A.  CLIN 0002 is what we have in the descriptive data.  It includes the  cost of getting personnel over to Sweden and back at the end of the  contract as well as the possibility of having to replace personnel and the  NSA training.  Q. Section E 004 - Is the DD Form 250 applicable to CLIN 002? A.  E004 does not apply to CLIN 0002. Q.  Section F.1 - What CLIN is applicable to FAR 52.247-29 and FAR  52.247-34 respectively? A.  I will be changing all of CLIN 0003 to FOB Destination.  Q. Section G002 - Is the Program Manager a Key Person? A. Yes.  Q. Section I - Since Section L046 (a) states that offerors are not  required to submit cost or pricing data, will the Air Force delete FAR  52.215-10 and FAR 52.215-12 since these clauses are not invoked? A.  I will remove FAR 52.215-10 and 52.215-12 from the contract when it is  awarded. Q. Section L.II.B.3.1 - What is the definition of a "separate form"  for the submission of technical and cost proposals? Are they separate  binders? Or, are the separate tabs within a binder? Or, are they separate  portions of an Air Force form? A.Separate forms simply means we need to be able to separate the cost  portion from the technical portion.  It can be separate binders if you  choose. Q.  Part of Para 4.15 states Sweden will provide private access to long  distance phone lines (note 1). Does this mean Sweden will be paying for  all long distance telephone calls or will the fees be charged to the task.  How about telephones? A.  The Swedish government (i.e. Forsvarets Materielverk - FMV) will  provide telephones in the U.S. COMSEC Vault for the U.S. custodians to  conduct official business, as well as access to long distance phone lines  for official business purposes. It is anticipated that the U.S. custodians  will use e-mail for most communications to U.S. or European agencies; and  therefore, the need to conduct long distance phone calls should be  minimal. HQ USEUCOM / J-9 will be providing Secure Telephone Equipment  (STE) devices for the U.S. COMSEC Vault, so the U.S. Custodians may  conduct secure voice communications with NSA offices or HQ USEUCOM / J-9,  as may be required. Q.. Should computers, printers, pc supplies, internet connection and ISP  provider and office consumables be part of the Firm Fixed Price bid? A.  Desk top computers, printers, computer supplies, NSA/GSA approved  shredder, internet connection, ISP provider service, and normal office  consumable items (paper, pencils, etc) will be provided buy the Swedish  government (i.e. FMV), as may be required. Q. We dont see where it states Sweden will provide a proper (note 2) CMS  vault. A CMS vault is where all of the CMS material is stored. It must be  large enough to allow our two custodians to work in it on a regular basis.  Will Sweden be providing the CMS vault or is it to be part of the Firm  Fixed Price bid? A. The U.S. COMSEC Vault facility is located within the FMV complex (in  Stockholm) and has been inspected by the USAFE Information Assurance  Branch and approved / certified for classified operations and storage of  classified COMSEC material up to Secret Releasable to Sweden. The  facility meets the standards outlined in NAG-14, Safeguarding COMSEC  Material and Facilities; EKMS 1, EKMS Policy and Procedures; EKMS 3A,  Inspection Guide Manual, and Annex E, Inspection Guide for Fixed COMSEC  Facilities. (Re HQ USAFE / A6NI letter dated 28 July 2006). The vault has  a large office working area, a new outer door and combination lock meeting  NSA/GSA required standards, and an inner vault for storage of CCIs and  COMSEC key-mat material. The vault is completely ready for activation. Q. We are under the impression that the packing/shipping/unpacking of  employee household goods and the shipping of their POVs would be charged  to item 0002 Noun: MOBILIGATION AND DEMOBILIZATIONOF SUPPORT.  Will their  cola and housing allowance also be charged to this item? A. The vendor will pay for all costs associated with the packing /  shipping / unpacking of employee household goods, as well as the shipment  of any employee POVs.  Cost of Living Allowance and housing allowance will  be negotiated between the vendor and its employees (i.e. the Custodian  personnel).  The costs for vehicles used for official business by the U.S  COMSEC Custodians will not be provided by FMV.  The vendors will need to  include the vehicle cost in their Proposals. They should consider the cost  of a small vehicle, gas consumption on a monthly basis, and vehicle  maintenance.   We do not anticipate that the US COMSEC Custodians will  need to be doing a lot of driving on a monthly basis in the performance of  their official duties. In addition, the custodians could always take a  train from Stockholm, if they need to travel to a distant location within  Sweden. Q.  Would you be able to provide the city whereas the work is going to be  performed? A  The work will be performed in the city of Stockholm.  The COMSEC vault  is located at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) facility  complex. Q.  Do you have any documentation, such as MOA/LOI that states this work  is in compliance with US export and import regulation?  If so, could you  please provide a copy? A.  No.  We are not exporting or importing materials.  We are contracting  services. The work is to be accomplished in compliance with the EUCOM/NATO  requirements. Q.  Section M. II.2.0(a)  -  Sub-section L.II.B.3.7(h) requires offerors to furnish past performance information with their technical proposals.  Will the Air Force revise the evaluation criteria in Section M.II.2.0 to include Past Performance as Sub-factor 2 so that only offerors with actual COMSEC experience are deemed technically acceptable A.  No  The past performance requested in Sec L.II.B.3.7(h)  is for the  technical evaluators information.  It will not be a determining factor in  the final decision. Q.  Section M. II.2.0(e) - The RFP states that an "offeror's price will be evaluated to ensure that proposed costs are reasonable and realistic" will the Air Force actually perform a price analysis on CLIN  001, pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(b) on CLIN 0001, and a cost realism analysis, pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(d) on CLIN 002? A.  Yes Q.  Section B CLIN 0002 - Does this cost element include the cost of housing (including miscellaneous household living items) for the personnel in Sweden, car rental, shipping, local transportation as well as travel expenses for the personnel? A.  It includes travel over and back as well as approved change in  personnel and NSA training.  All other costs are to be in CLIN 0001 Q. Regarding the SOW.   Does a US COMSEC account already exist or will it  need to be established? Will the primary and/or alternate COMSE Managers  participate in establishing a new COMSEC account?  If so, what will this  entail and if not, who will carry out all of the "one time" tasks/duties  required to establish a new US COMSEC account? A.  The US COMSEC Account has not been established because the COMSEC  Custodians have not been named yet.  The vault issue has been addressed in  question # 3 and has been approved by NSA.  Once the COMSEC Custodians are  named, NSA will establish a COMSEC account number.  After the COMSEC  Custodians arrive into Sweden, they will receive the COMSEC Custodian  training at Stockholm that will be provided to them from NSA Europe  (NCEUR).  (The travel funding for this training will be provided by USAF  ESC/KLI.) Amendment 0001 is available extending the receipt date from 1 Dec 06 to 8  Dec 08.  A copy will be emailed to all who have previously requested the  RFP.

 Amendment Number 2                                                                HSHQDC-07-Q-00010

NOTE: Offerors must acknowledge receipt of all Amendments with submission of proposal                                           

1. Is there any information on the estimated quantity of line items to be ordered by DHS?

The following figures are estimates from the most recently completed contract which was for a period of 1 year.  Note that these are estimates only and the Government does not guarantee any volumes/quantities for this requirement. 

(1)	8x10 prints, to include 6x8 image with signature border and DHS Logo:  400-450 
(2)	5x7 prints, to include 4x6 image with signature border and DHS Logo:  900-1000
(3)	20x30 prints, mounted protective spray finish, framed and wired for hanging: 85-100
(4 )8x10 montages consisting of 5-20 images/jpeg files and trip documentation: (Included within figure for 20x30 prints).  

Note that items are greeting photos and are ordered in quantities of 1 or 2 per shot with a variety of formats/sizes.  There are rarely any large quantity orders.  

2. How are you currently fulfilling these requirements? 

The services were being fulfilled by a Vendor whose contract expired on September 30, 2006.  

3. Are you specifying a photographic print? 

Yes.  Each order will have a specific style associated with it depending upon the event and print size.  The Government will provide guidance regarding required print size and any specifics that may be required for the prints such as the DHS Logo . 

4.) Are you specifying minimum standard paper? 

No, the Government requires quality paper, such as E-Surface, which is best suited when signatures are required.  

5.) Please explain the spraying of the protective finish. Are you specifying canvas for the 20x30's? We ask because photographic prints do not require protective sprays. 

 The Government requires that a clear or luster protection spray be applied on the prints.  Canvas is not required for the 20x30s.   

6)  Regarding "20x30 prints, mounted protective spray finish, framed and wired for hanging."  Where will the prints be displayed? i.e. interior or exterior?  Any additional information on the quality of the frame required is also requested.

Prints will be displayed in the interior with no glass.  These are internal communication/morale shots in a standard black thin wooden frame.  They are designed to be rotated from location and buildings.  They are currently mounted on gator foam and are very light weight.

7)  Is there a specific standard frame molding that the DHS Office of Affairs is requiring for the 20?x30? framed prints (ie. Metal or Wood, thickness of profile etc) 

Thin wooden black frame is required.   

8)  Would the Vendor be doing the collage work on the 8?x10? montages, if so, is there a sample available to review for the complexity of the Photoshop work? 

Yes, the Vendor shall do the collage work on the 8x10 montages.  The required layouts are of a standard nature and will not require any complex designs.  The Government will provide the shots (3-5) to use or select from.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR TURBINE PUMP ASSEMBLY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide the questions and answers to this synopsis/solicitation.	They are provided below: Question 1: The solicitation shows two different delivery requirements: 5 months ARO and the end of June 2007.  Which is correct? Answer 1: Delivery of the TPA will be by June 29, 2007.  This is the best estimate on how many months ARO since Im not sure when the Purchase Order will be sent out.  Id like to have it completed before the end of this month, but I can guarantee it.  Question 2: Is the refurbishment plan required to be submitted at part of the quote or will that be developed with NASA under the TPA unit contract?  Answer 2: The refurbishment is not part of the RFQ, at least in terms of the cost. What we are looking for is the cost and the required time to refurbish the TPA so that if we use all of the available life of the purchased TPA during testing, we will know how long it will take and what it will cost to have it refurbished. The refurbishment itself, if we were to do it, would be a separate purchase down the road separate from this particular RFQ. Question 3: Is there a required format for the proposal, or is offeror format acceptable?  Answer 3: There is no required format for the quotation.	Please be sure you include all of the required information that is stated in the synopsis/solicitation in the quotation.  Question 4: Is there a page limit for the proposal? Answer 4: There is no page limit.  The quotation shall include a technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary.	  Question 5: Is there a requirement that a certain percentage of the work be performed by the small business? Answer 5: There is no required percentage of small business participation.

<DESC>Award based on this solicitation is subject to availability of funds.  
(See FAR Clause- 52.232-18)

This solicitation is hereby amended as follows:  

The due date for this solicitation is changed from December 13, 2006 to 3:30 PM local time December 20, 2006. 

This requirement includes the following:

LINE ITEM 0001

1)       Vendor shall provide 20 truncated rectangular pyramids of accurately dimensioned oriented graphite block of specified chemical purity, density, mosaic distribution, and neutron transmission characteristics for MACS Scattered Beam Filter.  Thickness: 50mm.  Ref: Drawing  03802453 Rev-5. 
			
2)       Vendor shall provide pre-performance material sample (one month after receipt of order and prior to beginning of the production run).  The pre-performance materials sample shall be representative of the filter material to be delivered. The pre-performance sample, can be a laminated structure, and shall have a thickness along the c-direction of 50 mm. The dimensions in both orthogonal directions perpendicular to the c-axis shall be between 20 mm and 50 mm.

3)	Vendor shall provide a certified material analysis: Materials delivered under this order shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution in the block as measured through X-ray diffraction.  

The government will perform at least two types of analysis on the pre-performance materials sample and will report the results to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the sample. The analysis will include: 
 
1)	Diffraction using 14.7 meV neutrons to determine the mosaic distribution.  
2)	Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis as a function of neutron energy. 

Upon vendor request, the government will also carry out such measurements on material intended for inclusion in the product during the production phase. The results of such measurements will be reported to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the material. The total quantity of material to be analyzed in this fashion shall not exceed the total amount of material ordered. 

The Government analysis of material provide by the vendor does not relieve the vendor from their responsibility with respect to meeting the requirements set forth herein.

The materials shall meet the following specifications:
Materials Specifications 

Chemical Composition and Density:
This specification ensures sufficient content of the desired oriented graphite majority phase. 
-	Carbon as Pyrolytic Graphite >99% by weight
-	The overall density of each filter block (volume to be that defined by the corresponding drawings) shall exceed 95% of the room temperature density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, which is 2.26g/cm3.
Mosaic Distribution
This specification is set to maximize transmission in the intended application and to maximize efficiency as a filter for higher order neutrons. 
-	The average c-axis direction for a filter block shall be parallel to the high symmetry axis (the beam direction) of the blocks to within 1 degree. 
-	The average Full Width at Half Maximum Mosaic width for each of the twenty filter blocks as measured with 14.7 meV neutrons shall not exceed 5 degrees.
 
Neutron Transmission Specification

This specification ensures adequate neutron transmission in the operating energy range. Factors that reduce neutron transmission are neutron absorbing impurities, lattice defects, large mosaic distribution widths, and graphite powder inclusions.
-	The neutron transmission coefficient shall exceed 65% under these conditions: 
o	Room temperature. 
o	Neutron energies from 2.5 meV to 7 meV and 8 to 14.7 meV 
o	Transmission along the c-axis. 

Overall Physical Dimensions and Lamination Requirements

The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish of the twenty filter blocks are specified on the attached drawings.

The filter blocks can be built as laminated structures detailed by the vendor. If the vendor builds the filter blocks as laminated structures, then they must adhere to the following requirements in order to ensure that the potentially laminated bodies can be mounted effectively and that there are no open joints along beam axis 
-	Lamination planes shall be perpendicular to the central axis of the blocks.
-	This requirement is to prevent streaming through cracks in the lamination. The lamination structure shall preclude straight line neutron propagation within 10 degrees of the cylinder axis without passage through at least 35 mm solid graphite. 
-	The overall density of the laminated bodies with volume as defined by the corresponding drawings shall be at least 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 


Acceptance:

A certification of compliance with all specifications from the vendor shall be a condition for acceptance. In addition, one or more of the following acceptance tests will be carried out to ensure compliance with specifications: 
	Physical inspection to assure that the dimensions and tolerances are consistent with the supplied drawings. 
	Measurement of the weight of the filter blocks to determine whether the overall density (with volume as specified by the corresponding drawing) exceeds 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 
	Measurement of the overall mosaic distribution of the filter block using 14.7 meV neutrons. 
	Neutron diffraction measurements to ensure that the average c-axis direction coincides with the high symmetry axis of the filter blocks to within 1degree.
	Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis for a range of neutron energies. 

The Government intends to carry out the above testing within one month of delivery of the filter blocks.  The vendor may deliver the filter blocks in batches of five (5) provided that all twenty (20) units are delivered within six months ARO.

Delivery:

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. 
The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.
