<DESC>RECOVERY--NASA/DFRC has a requirement for developing a Concept of Operations(CONOPS) document for routine civil and commercial Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)operations in the National Airspace System (NAS) of the United States of America.  Thereis also a requirement to assess the current state of the art with respect to the nationsability to achieve the operational environment described in the CONOPS. In support ofthese efforts, the Contractor will author a CONOPS for internal NASA use that is acompilation of current CONOPS from NASA, DOD, and DHS and one for consideration by theJoint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). They will use the CONOPS to conduct aninitial state of the art assessment to identify where technology gaps exist in being ableto implement the NextGen CONOPS.NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Modern Technologies Solutions Inc. (MTSI),of Alexandria, VA. MTSI is in the unique position of being the only known commercialorganization which has written UAS NAS operations CONOPS.  The United States uniformedmilitary services have written some documents, but they obviously do not compete withcommercial firms for Government contracts.MTSI has developed CONOPS for several key federal agencies, including the Department ofDefense, Homeland Security and NASA. In doing so, they have gained unique insight intoUAS by supporting NASAs ERAST and Access 5 projects where MTSI provided systemsengineering support and led a highly specialize collision avoidance flight test activity. In performing this testing and CONOPS preparation activity, MTSI developed the flighttest plans, defined the research requirements and supported the flight approval briefingsrequired by this procurement. As such they gained valuable, unique insight into UAScollision avoidance issues and data collection requirements for UAS collision avoidancetesting.Serving in these capacities MTSI has had to work closely with the regulators and decisionmakers in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and has gained valuable and uniqueinsight into the FAAs perspective on how to integrate UAS into the NAS. They have alsodeveloped methodologies for assessing the safety of UAS operations that are currentlyviewed by the FAA as the most promising for eventually enabling routine UAS access to theNAS.  MTSI is the only known firm with the knowledge and expertise resulting from thesetypes of multi-agency activities, and which are imperative to successful performance ofthis procurement.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local timeon March 9, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The contractor would also be required to maintain BCAT, enhance it as required and to teach the application of the tool to all stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, RRD is seeking the development and implementation of a Loss Avoidance National Tool (LANT). A LANT will assess effectiveness of previously issued grants by capturing the avoidance of life and property loss due to grant implementation. Such analyses are not new; however, a uniform, automated approach is required to reduce analysts' effort and to provide a consistent methodology. The Contractor would also be responsible for training development and instruction for all stakeholders. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Technical communication of the tool, its application and installation is part of the requirement.</p>

Further, the Contractor would provide assistance to improve the quality of RRD technical reports.

There is a requirement that the Contractor provide expert support and advice on programmatic information analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This analysis will include quantitative and qualitative analyses and will utilize Geographical Information System (GIS) and spatial analysis related tools.</p>

LM MS2 has been the prime contractor for Aegis Weapon System (AWS) computer program development and the Aegis Combat Systems Engineering Agent (CSEA) since the inception of the Aegis Program in 1969.  This contractor is a highly specialized source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements for a functional removable Aegis adaptation at the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) by CY13 in support of the test and evaluation necessary to achieve an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in CY14.  As a result of LM MS2s involvement in the Aegis BMD Program, it is the only source that currently possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the systems requirements to perform the work contemplated herein.  No source, other than LM MS2 has access to the proprietary data, resident expertise, and resources to perform the work described herein.  This expertise cannot be obtained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring substantial duplicative costs and risk.  The anticipated period of performance for the effort is up to 10 years after contract award.  The proposed contract action is for system engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) as implemented in FAR 6.302.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly.  See Note 22.

Background:  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires Contractor support for its Health Information Technology (IT) Standards and Test Methods Project.  The objective of the project is to focus resources on specific, national priority standards and testing needs in the healthcare community to further clinical information exchange among providers, consumers, public health and other stakeholders.  This project does not seek to select the standards that should be used by the healthcare community; it seeks to analyze those standards deemed appropriate by the healthcare community by objectively determining the maturity, robustness, testability and suitability of a particular standard for use (i.e., is it free from ambiguities, errors, inconsistencies, omissions, and to the extent possible, meets intended requirements).  Additionally, this project seeks to develop appropriate test material, data and standard-specific test tools for high priority national need standards and interoperability.

<DESC><strong>Original Title</strong>: NLM Project Proposal: Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification: an NLM Public Safety Initiative - a Digital Image Inventory of the Nation's Oral Solid-Dose Prescription Medications
<p><strong>Revised Title</strong> - NLM Project Synopsis - MODIFICATION: Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification: Content-Based Information Retrieval of a Digital Image Inventory of the Nation's Oral Solid-Dose Prescription Medications<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Information (RFI) and a separate written solicitation WILL be issued. The solicitation number is RFI No. NLM-10-057-CYC. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside and the NAICS Code is 541990.</p>
<p>In a national effort to promote patient safety, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) proposes to create a comprehensive, public digital image inventory of the nation's commercial prescription solid dose medications. The primary intention of this effort is create a test data collection for the advancement of automatic pharmaceutical identification through computer vision from photographic data. NLM expects to promote computer vision research applied to the domain of content-based information retrieval (CBIR) of solid-dose pharmaceuticals, and anticipates the need for generating a test environment, including variations of photographs of the same drug or sample under different environments. We invite ideas and plans for the structure for such a test collection subset of the overall imaging effort including a discussion of issues such as: (1) the number of validated sample images needed to evaluate automated drug identification algorithms, (2) the different photographic conditions and equipment necessary to effectively support a test image collection, and (3) a plan for deploying and maintaining such a collection in support of a grand challenge or other mechanism for promoting computer vision for solid-dose pharmaceutical identification. These data will be cross-correlated with high-resolution imagery of the same products, providing a baseline and authoritative measurement of attributes of the samples including color, shape, and surface properties such as scoring, coating, or debossed text.</p>
<p>Our current effort is a continuation and extension of our previous project providing the Veterans Administration with a complete digital photographic catalog of the VA Centralized Mail Order Pharmacy formulary for prescription tablets and capsules.</p>
<p>We intend to create a collection of digital photographs of prescription tablets and capsules, acquiring the images through a Simplified Acquisition Procedure. This will be an award to a contractor or vendor who will be responsible for formulating a protocol with the participation of NLM staff for acquiring the sample medications and creating images of medications to promote the development of automatic computer-vision-based identification of solid-dose pharmaceutical samples including variations in lighting, camera angle, background, photographic equipment, image resolution, and other attributes. We believe that there are between 5,000 and 32,000 prescription solid-dose oral medications to be cataloged through this process. In addition to these images for research support, the contractor will be responsible for creating high resolution digital photographs of the front (obverse) and back (reverse) surfaces of the samples using conventional techniques for color management, confirming that the images match the description of the medication, developing and matching the images of the samples to relevant metadata (including size descriptions, dimensions, color, and the provenance of the sample), and transmitting those data (images and metadata) to the NLM. The contractor will deliver matching test images accompanying the reference images to develop test collections for CBIR research.</p>
<p>The CBIR test data will be crafted into training and validation collections to support research in computer vision. The accompanying high-resolution digital image collection from this effort will be placed by NLM in the public domain. The impact of these collections will target patient safety including assisting in drug identification for poison control hotlines as well as online services for the public and nursing care professionals to confirm the identification of a drug to help prevent mistakes in medication. Other uses of the image collections include education and applications in pharmacy pedagogy such as its inclusion in textbooks and digital teaching materials. These applications demand high resolution, high quality images with good color reproduction to faithfully represent the medications through imagery. Smaller images and subsets of the collection can be generated from the original high-resolution data for other applications that do not require the same level of fidelity; however, we are committed to acquiring the best data possible through this mechanism.</p>
<p>NLM intends to identify a contractor or assemble a contractor-and-subcontractor team to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced digital macro-photography talent as well as credentials and experience necessary to safely handle oral solid-dose prescription medications. The matching of the images to the correct identification of the medications is at least as critical as the dispensing of the medications to patients for treatment in that the impact of a mis-identification could have grave consequences. The need for quality control and verification in this project is likely to be significantly higher since the distribution of the resulting data could have widespread public impact, both a positive one if the collection is comprehensive and detailed, and significant negative impacts if there are errors in the database. The contractor should have clear explicit procedures for verifying the data and its correct correspondence to the medications from which it was derived. NLM expects the final team to incorporate photographers, assistants familiar with the handling of pharmaceuticals, a pharmacist for the appropriate qualifications in receiving, handling, and disposing of prescription medications, administrative technicians for the verification and electronic delivery of the digital images and their associated data, and information technology support for image processing, the extraction metadata, and technical support of the digital camera, its software, data storage and backup, as well as internet support to enable the electronic delivery of the digital data. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the final team should include computer science personnel to help craft the CBIR component of the project.</p>
<p>We anticipate that this first award will encompass the acquisition, photography, and the electronic delivery of the resulting digital data of between 4,500 and 6,000 prescription medications. Proposals addressing this requirement should not surpass 1 year in duration. Up to four (4) options for additional services (the additional acquisition of images of pharmaceutical samples in lots of 6,000 samples) should be provided by teams responding to this requirement.<br />The review and award process will follow a two-step process:</p>
<p>1. A Request for Information (RFI) - Search for Sources will be conducted: Any offeror or group wishing to participate in the competition process MUST reply to the search for sources. Potential sources for this work will be asked for examples of their previous work and statements of their capabilities to meet the challenges posed by this project. If a substantial number of contractors respond to this RFI, NLM may use a Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) to evaluate the potential sources on their existing facilities, technical approach, capabilities for the acquisition and disposal of samples, expertise of available personnel, consultants, and subcontractors (including photographers, computer scientists, image processors, pharmacists, and technicians), and past performance. NIH personnel reserve the right to visit potential sites as part of the search for sources; however, a site visit is not required for a future award.</p>
<p>2. A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued for a photographic collection. Only sources identified as competitive through the search for sources will be solicited for quotes for the competition. A complete Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) will be convened to make the award including any options to the contract or purchase order. These/this award(s) will be executed quickly through a Simplified Acquisitions Mechanism under FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>Response to the Search for Sources:</p>
<p>NLM will review the responses to the search for sources based on an evaluation of the responder's capabilities to execute both the expected photographic collection as well as the optional creation of the computer vision test data set. Responses to the Request for Information (RFI) that constitutes the search for sources will evaluate:</p>
<p>1. Proposed methods for acquiring the data: The response will be evaluated based on the overall technique. A complete proposal is not required, but rather an overview of the proposed method. How does the potential contractor plan to acquire sample medications? How will the contractor ensure that all images are properly identified with the correct medication? How will they process the image data for color management, size accuracy, and background removal?<br />2. Qualifications of existing personnel: The response will be evaluated based on the technical merits of the named existing personnel. Do they have experience in digital photography? Do they have expertise in managing digital images for record photography, curatorship, or some other related enterprise?<br />3. Existing facilities: Since this award process is not intended to provide funds for new equipment acquisition, the responders should describe their current capabilities for acquiring the data for the proposed photographic collection. If modifications of any equipment is required, the responses should describe the extent of the modifications, what capabilities are possible using the current configurations, and what capabilities will be enabled by proposed changes to the equipment.<br />4. Past performance: The responses should provide sources for relevant references of past performance in data acquisition.<br />5. Samples of previous work: The responses should include photographic or digital illustrations and evidence of previous results. These results should demonstrate the capability of the responder to provide the proposed data with accurate identification of the contents of individual images.</p>
<p>Page Limit to responses to the RFI:</p>
<p>Responses to the RFI search for sources should be limited to 10 pages of textual information (with figures and tables). Additional illustrations, photographs and evidence of results (presented in photographs or digital information) must accompany the response. The total response should not exceed 15 pages (text plus pictures).</p>
<p><strong>Due Date:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Responses to the search for sources RFI are due on March 2, 2010. Electronic copies of the RFI response are due by the application deadline. In addition to the official electronic submission, two printed copies of the Sources Sought response are required. These printed hard copies should be printed, 3-hole punched, and submitted in binders. NLM anticipates an official deadline for electronic submission by noon (12:00 PM), Tuesday March 2, 2010, with an official deadline for printed hard copy submission by close of business, Friday March 5, 2010. Electronic copies of submissions should be sent via e-mail to the Contracting Specialist, Cara Calimano, at calimac@mail.nlm.nih.gov. The submission may be split into multiple e-mails to accommodate e-mail servers. At the completion of the submission of responses to the Sources Sought RFI, even if only a single e-mail is transmitted, an additional confirmation text-only e-mail should be transmitted, communicating that a complete submission has been sent and detailing the contents of each file and how many separate e-mail files should be expected. Paper copies may be submitted in writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 6707 Democracy Blvd. Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Cara Calimano, Contract Specialist.</strong></p>

The Cooperative Research Program complements other NMFS programs and contributes to improved fishery stock assessments and the evaluation of management options. Supported Research Projects for this contract will require participation by trawl vessels operating on Georges Bank and in the Gulf of Maine. Commercial fishing vessels in both sectors and the common pool are needed.<br />The Contractor shall assist in collecting and confirming tow-by-tow data through an electronic logbook system and a web based data confirmation system. This will be accomplished through use of the Study Fleet Fisheries Logbook Data Recording System (FLDRS) software, or approved sector management electronic reporting tools, and NEFSC web portal system. Data collected will support research emphasizing enhanced stock monitoring, the management transition to Allowable Catch Limits (ACLs) and sectors through the use of electronic reporting technology, and Study Fleets for a variety of fisheries. Some of the specific projects include:<br />1) Winter flounder and yellowtail summer flounder age, growth, maturation and fecundity;<br />2) Temporal and spatial patterns in sex ratios, size, and proportions of dogfish and skates;<br />3) Size composition, growth and maturity of winter flounder;<br />4) Temporal and spatial performance information - catch and discard by species - relative to specific gear designs and operating procedures; evaluation of the use of self-reported and observer data at fine scales to improve the precision of fleet and sub-fleet discard estimates;<br />5) Operating procedures relative to changes that may occur in relation to fishing practices under sectors.<br />This solicitation seeks quotes from trawl vessel Contractors fishing on Georges Bank and in the Gulf of Maine. Vessels with significant landings records of flatfish and other groundfish species, particularly Georges Bank haddock, and vessels with previous Study Fleet experience are encouraged to provide a quote.<br />This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-aside.

Vessels will be selected to assist in field testing versions of the Fisheries Logbook Data Recording System (FLDRS) electronic logbook system, a web-based data confirmation system, and Study Fleet reporting and data collection protocols. NOAA anticipates making multiple contract awards (estimated between 25 and 35 awards) as a result of this solicitation. The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors 1 - 3, listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Vessel's commercial fishing history and the vessel's fishing capability: i.e. vessel's landings allocation letter from NMFS Northeast Regional Office and regulatory compliance and catch reporting history; (2) Captain's work experience and qualifications including research qualifications and past experience in Cooperative Research, if applicable; (3) Vessel characteristics and configuration, electronics, particulars and general arrangement, including any net mensuration equipment. <br />All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.

Proposed Issue Date: March 16,2010 (Approximate)Title of Project: Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (LEKT) Wastewater System, OLYM-005375.3.08, Port Angeles WADescription:  This project will construct a new vacuum assisted wastewater collection system within the LEKT reservation that will convert tribal residences from septic tank and leach field treatment systems to a reservation-wide collection system.  The existing septic tanks will be abandoned in accordance with State of Washington Department of Ecology requirements.  This collection system will not provide treatment of the wastewater other than odor control as it is being conveyed to the City of Port Angeles' existing wastewater treatment plant.  
The vacuum assisted wastewater collection system will consist of approximately four (4) miles of vacuum mainlines and three (3) miles of service laterals from structures to the vacuum mainlines.  Each structure will have a gravity to vacuum conversion collection valve pit.  The collected wastewater will be conveyed to a single vacuum and lift station pump house, located on the reservation, where the wastewater will be pumped approximately two (2) miles, within a forcemain, along the new Lower Elwha Valley Access Road alignment.  The forcemain will change to a gravity sanitary sewer main, approximately one-half (0.5) miles in length, that will outfall into the existing City of Port Angeles' wastewater collection system.
The NAICS code is 237110. The small business size standard is $33,500,000. The estimated price range for this project is between $11M and $13.5 Million. 
Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. Small Disadvantaged Business and  HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns  and  52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search).

<CONTACT>Stephanie L. Baker, Contract Specialist, Phone 2024022262, Email stephanie.l.baker@hud.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Single Family Asset Management, intends to procure Appraisal Oversight Services for single family and preforeclosure Real Estate Owned (REO) properties owned by HUD for the United States and all its territories (US Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa). The contracted services will provide for desk appraisal reviews and field appraisal reviews. The appraisal directly affects the property's marketability and establishes the property's list price. Additionally, the appraisal may be used as an underwriting instrument for the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) if the property is designated insurable. HUD appraisal oversight monitors the accuracy and quality of appraisals through quality assurance appraisal reviews. HUD requires the assistance of an appraisal review service to perform these quality assurance appraisal reviews (desk reviews and field reviews.)<br />In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.204, the government intends for this acquisition to be offered for competition among eligible 8(a) concerns. This requirement will be solicited as a 100% 8(a) set-aside.<br />This will be a Firm-Fixed-Price type contract. The proposed contract period of performance is a base period of 12-months, with four, 12-month option periods.<br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 531320-Appraisal services, real estate.<br />The anticipated release date of the solicitation will be on or about March 22, 2010, with a 30 day posting period. Instructions for submitting questions and proposals will be given at the time the solicitation is released, as will the actual closing date for offers. No questions will be accepted via telephone; electronic means only.<br />The resulting award will be a Best Value Trade-Off, with non-cost factors being more important than cost. If at any time the government determines that the requested services are no longer required, the government reserves the right not to make an award. The government also reserves the right to award without discussions.<br />All responses from responsible 8(a) concerns will be considered for evaluation and contract award.<br />All inquiries regarding this requirement shall be submitted electronically, and directed to Ms. Stephanie Baker, Contracting Specialist, at <a href="mailto:Stephanie.L.Baker@HUD.gov">Stephanie.L.Baker@HUD.gov</a>.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Recovery (ARRA): Coherent X-Ray Detector Fabrication and Assembly for SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
<p>Please review the folders for the specifications and drawings for this requirement.  The folder "CXI Detector Stage Base Plate" contains the files for fabricated/procured parts and we would like to have a vendor deliver the complete, assembled component.  For the folder "CXI Detector Stage Kinematic Stages" you will find three subfolders containing all of the necessary drawings for three individual stages (each with a different functionality), again we would like to have the three stages delivered as completed assemblies.</p>
<p>Important point: Some drawings are currently in the process of being revised.  These revisions won't affect form/fit/function so the cost isn't expected to be influenced by the revisions.  Once the revisions are released (sometime next week) we will replace the old PDF's with the latest version.</p>
<p>This is a presolicitation not a RFQ/RFP.  The RFQ/RFP will be issued in the near future.  If interested in receiving the RFQ/RFP then you must identify yourself as an interested vendor.</p>

<DESC>General Information<BR><BR>The Northwest Region will initiate the standardization process for Wound Care-Adhesives for its seven Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in Washington and Alaska.  The product line consists of various models and types of Wound Care-Adhesives. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR> <BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the NorthWest region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Region include but are not limited to:<BR>Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA.<BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 02/10.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Rosa Crumpton, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil<BR>B. Products & Performance Required<BR>The NorthWest Region is seeking Wound Care-Adhesives which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within the region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $221,344. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.

Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the NorthWest Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Source Selection Procedures: <BR>Pre-Source Selection Procedures:<BR>1. The TRBO has used market research to confirm the availability of the product which the Northwest Region DSL has selected for standardization. <BR>2. The MTFs in the Region volunteer and Clinical Product Team (CPT) members are selected for participation in the standardization process.  The 4 MTFs that will be participating in the clinical evaluation of this standardization initiative are Bassett Army Community Hospital, AK; Naval Hospital Bremerton, WA; Elmendorf Air Force Base Hospital, AK; and Madigan Army Medical Center, WA.<BR>3. The Clinical Product Team (CPT) validates/approves the equally weighted criteria outlined below.<BR>4. The CPT determined and approved that both literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical setting. Requested samples will only include high-volume products. <BR>5. The Northwest Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) develops and submits the APP and Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Request for Quotes through the DSL for review by Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP). <BR>Source Selection Procedure<BR>1. This selection procedure is a one-step source selection process. The Northwest Region will post the RFQ to the FBO for a period of 21 calendar days. A letter (email) notice to the current vendors identified in the market share analysis above will be sent after the FBO is posted. The closing date and time will be the same, for the RFQ and for the email notification. <BR>2. Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO posted RFQ by emailing their interest in participating in the standardization process to the point of contact (POC) listed on the FBO. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial response regarding their interest in participating in the standardization process, actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of close of business (COB) 4:00 pm (PST) Pacific Standard Time on the date listed for closing on the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <BR>3. The TRBO will request responses to the technical and company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. The one-step source selection process provides vendors with 21 calendar days to respond to the TRBO with the completed spreadsheet for both the Technical/Company criteria, deliver the no charge literature and no charge samples to the MTFs participating in the clinical evaluation process, and provide the Vendors best value price quote; and. <BR>4. The Technical/Company Criteria worksheets will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date. Vendor response should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions and criteria listed in the FBO announcement. Vendors that do not respond to the technical/company criteria will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <BR>5. The product literature request and sample request list will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by COB 4:00 PM PST, 14 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment.  The samples to be provided are as follows: The samples: Provide 1 set to each MTF as follows: 2 rolls silk type surgical tape; between 1-3 wide, 2 rolls foam type surgical tape; between 1-3 wide, 2 rolls transparent type surgical tape; between 1-3 wide, 1 box transparent film dressing; between 3-4 wide, 1 box wound closure strips; between 1/4'-1/2 wide.<BR>6. Vendors that do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples or fail to send literature and samples to the MTFs will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. <BR>7. The Best Value Price Quote worksheets will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Region reserves the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. <BR>8. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR>9. The TRBO team will compile the technical and company criteria responses and the results will be forwarded to the CPT. The technical and company criteria are weighted equally. The CPT and TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. <BR>10. The CPT members will evaluate each vendors literature and sample set against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-patient/non-clinical setting. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last up to 21 days. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The CPT will send the completed evaluations to the TRBO for data entry and analysis and the results will be forwarded to the CPT and TPRB for review. <BR>11. The vendors will forward price quotes to the TRBO, the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis, and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric), and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the DAPA prices will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the offer.<BR>12. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. The Northwest Region TPRB will review the data to support a selection of the best value, lower overall cost quote. The TPRB will vote on a standardized vendor for Wound Care-Adhesives.  Each MTF on the TPRB is allotted one vote for the selection of the standardized vendor.  The votes are tallied and the vendor with the majority of votes is the selected standardized vendor.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.<BR>Technical/Company Criteria:<BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Wound Care-Adhesive.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  Wound Care-Adhesive products required by the region (at a minimum) are surgical tapes (various widths), wound closure strips, transparent dressings (various sizes), and adhesive dressings and bandages (various sizes and widths).   NOTE:  Vendors:  Please state that you can provide a complete product line and a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.).  In addition, send any applicable product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Wound Care-Adhesive Product Line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Regions Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in Region 11.)  Please provide documentation of your companys agreement with this Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4. Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<BR>5. Vendor must provide latex free options for product line. Please indicate products that are latex free.<BR>6. Vendors must provide educational tools or materials for this product line.  Please list the tools available to staff and patients in response to this solicitation.<BR>7. All products must be labeled with product description (i.e. dimensions, sterility, ply count, etc).<BR>8. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>a. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>b.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances  the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. 
	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbents actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is soliciting information about potential sources for SPACE SUIT SYSTEM(SSS) VISOR MATERIALS.  Information on optically clear base materials (rigid orflexible) and coating systems that can provide improvements in scratch-resistance andhydrophobia/fog-resistance is being sought.  A material system, meeting new materialrequirements would be further evaluated for use in the next generation helmet visors.The current Extravehicular Visor Assembly (EVVA) consists of a transparent protectivevisor, a sun visor, and sun shades. The transparent protective visor in the front of theEVVA is polycarbonate. The sun visors base material is polysulfone. Both the protectivevisor and sun visor have ultraviolet and infrared (UV/IR) coatings layers on the insidesurface of the helmet. The EVVA materials are required to meet mission performancerequirements when operated in a large variety of environments. These environments includeexposure to fungus, humidity, ozone, salt fog, thermal radiation, solar ionizingradiation, sand/dust, random vibration, sinusoidal vibration, acceleration, shock,pressure, temperature, atmosphere, micrometeoroids/orbital debris, solar ultraviolet, andatomic oxygen. Requirements related to material systems include refractive power limits,haze limits, and allowables for minor visible distortion or optical defects.Transmittance ranges are specified in the UV, luminus, and IR spectrum regions, toaddress visibility and UV protection. Thermal/optical coating characteristics includingtransmittance, front reflectance, and back reflectance are called out for the sun visorand protective visor.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking information on portable runway lighting systems in support of the USMC Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) mission.  Recent advances in off-the-shelf battery, remote control and light emitting diode (LED) technologies have shown the potential to replace or augment existing systems in the EAF inventory.

An immediate solution to desired capabilities stated herein is not required at this time.  The intent of this RFI is to gain awareness of the different technical approaches being pursued by industry to advance the market of airfield lighting.  The capabilities and technical characteristics presented in this synopsis shall be considered as guidance only, do not represent a final system specification, and may be subject to change at a later date.

The EAF concept supports a myriad of airfield lighting configurations, ranging in size and complexity from single-aircraft vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) sites, to short runways for tactical aircraft, to extended runways for heavy cargo lift.  Therefore, it would be impractical to define such complete, overarching capability in a single, inflexible performance specification.  For the purpose of this RFI, the term modified medium intensity, visual flight rules will be used as a generic performance description for a system capable of supporting a single, 4000-ft long runway.  The demonstrated or implied potential to improve upon the stated capabilities in order to increase the application and/or capability of the system, or its components, will also be considered.

The unique operating scenario of the EAF concept places many equipment configuration specifications outside the scope of US Navy (NAVAIR 51-50AAA-2), Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) requirements.  Although verbatim adherence to such published specifications would therefore be impractical, individual technical characteristics previously established by these agencies have served as the basis for a number of the performance criterion stated in this synopsis.


Desired System Capability

1.  System shall be capable of supporting both Night Vision Device (NVD) -aided and un-aided flight operations through the use of visual spectrum and infrared spectrum light sources.

2.  The system shall be capable of providing adequate visual cues to allow acquisition of the airfield at a minimum straight-on approach distance of 3 nautical miles.  This shall apply to both NVD-aided and un-aided flight operations.

3.  All system components shall be stored aboard one, single-axle towed trailer.  Trailer chassis shall be an approved variant of the Light Tactical Trailer, Heavy Chassis (LTT-HC); to include the Flatdeck (LTT-F), Flatdeck Extended (LTT-FE) and Marine Corps Chassis (LTT-MCC).  Total system weight, including trailer, shall not exceed 4200 pounds.

 
4.  The system shall, at a minimum, contain of the following airfield lighting components:

	16 Runway Edge Lights
	  2 Runway End Identifier Lights
	  8 Runway Threshold Lights
	  1 Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) system

5.  All airfield lighting components shall utilize light emitting diodes (LED) or other solid state lighting devices for their light source.

6.  All airfield lighting components shall be powered by rechargeable batteries, and include provisions for hard-wiring to a prime power source.  Batteries shall be capable of maintaining the maximum power output of each fixture for a minimum of 16 hours, continuous, even when the battery capacity has been degraded to 75% of its as-manufactured capacity.  All fixtures shall be capable of being fully recharged (within 95% of capacity) in less than 8 hours.  The necessary battery charging equipment, sufficient to simultaneously recharge all the airfield lighting components provided with the system, shall be integral to the system and/or individual components.

7.  On-board battery charging equipment shall be capable of operating from all commonly found voltages worldwide.

8.  The system shall include one (1) DOD-approved 3kW diesel-fueled generator (model number MEP-831A) for the purpose of battery recharging, short-term hard-wired operation, and the operation of other ancillary equipment.

9.  The method for providing hard-wired power distribution, other than the interface to each individual fixture, does not need to be defined in detail at this time.

10.  Each airfield lighting component shall posses the means to be manually switched on/off and through all intensity and output settings.  Additionally, each lighting fixture shall be capable of wireless control of all functions through a dedicated remote control unit operating within the appropriate ISM band.

11.  All airfield lighting fixtures shall exhibit ingress protection to a level of IP67 or NEMA 6.  Although the system is intended to be portable and capable of rapid installation, all runway lighting components shall be expected to survive an installed duration of no less than 12 months.

12.  All airfield lighting fixtures shall possess the ability to recharge their battery when both attached or detached from the fixture.  Removing the battery (or batteries) from a fixture shall not require any tools.

13.  All airfield lighting fixtures shall be capable of being fitted to an individual mounting base.  Mounting bases shall be capable of being secured to surfaces including, but not limited to: routine/hard soil, asphalt, rock, coral, concrete, and various types of airfield surfacing materials (matting).  Attaching hardware for securing the fixture to such surfaces may be determined and sourced separately by NAVAIR Lakehurst.  Mounting base shall possess a means to positively lock the light to the base while retaining frangibility of the fixture.  Mounting bases shall be retrievable, require no scheduled maintenance and will be considered consumable items.

<SUBJECT>Request for Expression of Interest and Announcement of a Vendor Conference for Support of the Design and Fabrication of a Central Solenoid Magnet System for ITER, an International Collaboration to Construct an Experimental Fusion Reactor
<SOLNBR>ORNL-185
<ARCHDATE>04302010
<CONTACT>Pat Smith, Phone 865-574-2883, Fax 865-241-5503, Email smithpr1@ornl.gov - Jeremy R. Duncan, Subcontract Administrator, Phone 8655760477, Email duncanjr@ornl.gov
<DESC>Introduction<br />The Magnet Systems Team of the US ITER Project Office is responsible for delivering the Central Solenoid (CS) Magnet System to ITER, an international collaboration head-quartered in Cadarache, France. The project is being designed and built by the ITER partners: the European Union, India, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States. US project responsibilities will be accomplished through a collaboration of DOE laboratories, universities, and industry. The U.S. ITER Project Office is hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with partner labs Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Savannah River National Laboratory. <br />From Latin for "the way", ITER has the goal of demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of extracting net power from a burning, fusion plasma. Achieving this burning plasma requires the resolution of complex physics issues and the integration of new and improved technologies. ITER is designed to be the premier scientific tool for exploring and testing expectations for plasma behavior in the burning-plasma regime, wherein the fusion process itself provides the dominant heat source to sustain the plasma temperature. The fusion power from this machine will be up to ten times greater than the total external power required for operating the machine and heating its plasma. As such, it will provide the scientific basis and plasma-control tools needed to move toward commercial power from fusion energy.<br />The United States is an equal, non-host partner, responsible for about 9% of the construction cost of ITER. As such, it will contribute hardware components, personnel, cash, and contingency during the construction phase of the project. The CS magnet system will be a major part of the US-contributed hardware.
<p>Background<br />The CS Magnet System is very large superconducting magnet system that will be comprised of a stack of 6 Modules and the External Structure that holds them all together and supports them during operation. A total of 7 CS modules will be manufactured, with one serving as a spare. All modules will be delivered to the ITER Site, Cadarache, France, along with the External Structure and special tooling for assembly.<br />The CS Modules will be constructed from Nb3Sn-based, cable-in-conduit conductors supplied by the Japanese Team in lengths of either 600 or 900 meters each (and weights of about 11 or 16 metric tons, respectively). Each module will weigh approximately 110 metric tons when finished, and when assembled, the total system will be approximately 18 meters tall and weigh around 900 metric tons. When charged to full current of 45 kilo-amperes, the assembly will produce fields of over 12 Tesla and will store over 6 Giga-Joules of energy. Terminal-to-terminal operating voltages up to 14 kilo-volts are expected. The superconducting-magnet technologies embodied in the ITER CS Magnet System are essential to future fusion reactors but may also be regarded as enabling technologies for future large superconducting magnetic systems.<br />The design of the CS Magnet System is presently in an advanced conceptual-design stage. The project is now ready to begin preliminary design.</p>
<p>Acquisition Plan<br />An acquisition plan has been developed. The main elements of the acquisition plan are as follows:<br />&bull; The US Domestic Agency (DA) is responsible for the design of the CS modules, structures, and assembly tooling and for the assembly procedures<br />&bull; Industrial vendors will be selected after final design to provide the CS structures and assembly tooling <br />&bull; Study contracts will be placed with potential industrial vendors for the CS structures and assembly tooling to assist the US DA design and planning efforts<br />&bull; Long lead materials for the CS structures will be procured by the US DA before the completion of final design and provided to the industrial vendors as government furnished equipment (GFE)<br />&bull; An industrial vendor will be selected as soon as possible to provide the CS module fabrication<br />&bull; The US DA will develop (with industry support) critical fabrication processes prior to award of the CS module fabrication contract and transfer this technology to the industrial vendor<br />&bull; Study contracts will be placed with potential industrial vendors for the CS modules as needed to assist the US DA design, manufacturing development, and planning efforts until the production contract is awarded<br />Schedules for acquiring the CS modules, structures, and assembly are illustrated in the attached figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p>A Look Forward at ITER CS Business Opportunities<br />The purpose of this announcement is to identify prospective vendors to support this acquisition plan through assisting in CS design and planning activities, providing structural materials, and fabricating the CS modules, structures, and assembly tooling.<br /><br />To provide early information about the ITER CS design, fabrication, and future business opportunities, a vendor conference will be held on April 7, 2010 in Oak Ridge, TN. At this conference, the CS acquisition plan, along with details of the project schedule and the design and fabrication effort will be presented and discussed. Potential suppliers for CS modules, structures, assembly tooling, and bulk materials are encouraged to attend. Feedback from prospective vendors on the acquisition plan is sought.<br /><br />Registration for the vendor conference is required before March 5, 2010. Please register with Pat Smith, US ITER Contracts Assistant, by COB, March 5, 2010. (Pat Smith, 1055 Commerce Park, MS 6483, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-6483, smithpr1@ornl.gov, 865 574-2883). Registration by e-mail is preferred. Company name, number and names of potential attendees, and country of citizenship are required. Attendees that are not United States citizens must also provide their date of birth and country of birth. If you are unable to attend but are interested in future CS business opportunities, please contact Pat Smith.<br /><br />Procurement of the CS modules will begin with the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) in August 2010 and contract award in March 2011. This will be a contract for a single vendor (or team) for the fabrication of the CS modules.<br />Preliminary design will be in progress during the period of this solicitation. Manufacturing input into CS module design and planning efforts during this period will be arranged through individual study contracts or through Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) with task orders for specific studies. Prospective suppliers for the CS modules are encouraged to participate in these study contracts, or BOAs, for providing manufacturing input. <br /><br />Procurement of the CS structures will begin following final design with the release of the RFP in May 2013 and contract award in October 2013. These will be contracts with one or more vendors for the fabrication of CS structures.<br />The design of the CS structures may entail the use of hundreds of tons of high strength stainless steel. To avoid lengthy schedule delays, we plan to procure much of this material in advance and provide it to the structure fabricators as government furnished equipment (GFE). The RFP for this procurement will be released midway through final design in February 2012 with contract award in June 2012.<br /><br />The US DA is responsible for providing any special purpose assembly tooling needed to assemble the CS modules and structures into a single unit. Procurement of the CS assembly tooling will begin following final design with the release of the RFP in January 2013 and contract award in June 2013. These will be contracts with one or more vendors for the fabrication of CS assembly tooling.<br /><br />Procurement of the CS structures and assembly tooling will not occur until after final design is completed. As with the CS modules, manufacturing input into CS structures and assembly tooling design and planning efforts during this period will be arranged through individual study contracts or through Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with task orders for specific studies. Prospective suppliers for the CS structures and assembly tooling are encouraged to participate in these study contracts or BOAs for providing manufacturing input.<br /><br />We thank you for your interest in the potential ITER CS business opportunities.</p>

<DESC>Recovery Project Site Viewing, Anthony Lakes Highway Road 73 Reconstruction, 
Wallowa-Whitman NF

Draft Project Overview

The following project description will, most definitely, change between now and when the solicitation is advertised, but due to the season in which this solicitation will be advertised, this project is being announced so that potential offerors may visit the site and ensure conditions are seen before the snow covers the project area.  

There will be no scheduled showing trips nor will a Forest Service employee be available to accompany prospective bidders to the site. However, bidders are reminded that is is their responsiblity to determine for themselves the actual site conditions and only by physical inspection, on-the-ground viewing can offerors assure themselves of the existing conditions. Maps are available at the Whitman Ranger District office. Thank you.

The set aside has not been determined.

The Anthony Lakes Highway project is approximately 10 miles long, and is one of the higher standard paved roads on the Forest.  The project requires, but is not limited to construction staking, clearing and grubbing, slope rounding, excavation, slope scaling, drainage structures, culverts, geo-textile, riprap, aggregate, pit development, asphalt re-surfacing, hydro seeding and mulching, signs, and temporary traffic control.  In addition, there are utilities buried in the road that need to be protected.

The project is divided into four (4) segments.  Segment A (6.13 mi.) requires crack sealing, and a chip seal over the existing asphalt surface.  Segment B (2.55 mi.) requires pulverizing the existing asphalt, adding base aggregate and repaving with new hot mix asphalt.  Segment C (0.21 mi.) requires sub-excavating the road and replacing the road structure with geo-textile material, base and surface aggregate, and repaving with hot mix asphalt.  Segment D (0.60 mi.) also requires crack sealing and a chip seal.

There are four (4) design sections that will address cut slope stabilization.  These sections target cut slopes by either benching the existing slope or reconstructing the cut slope to a gentler ratio.  The remaining cut slope stabilization sections will be addressed by slope scaling.

Excavation from the design sections, slope scaling sections, and slope rounding will be utilized in the Anthony Lakes Ski Run parking lot expansion (Sta. 477+50), and the Anthony Snow Park parking lot expansion (Sta. 513+80).  Stump disposal, wood chip, and excavation waste area are located on Rd. 7300140 (Sta. 440+97).  Additional alternative excavation waste areas may be utilized at (Sta. 509+00), and Anthony Lakes Ski Run bunny hill re-contouring (Sta. 484+50) if needed.

To further stabilize the cut slopes, hydro seeding, and wood chip mulch will be placed on the cut slopes to provide erosion control.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work to: De-water, clean, inspect, and repair the tainter valves at R. F. Henry, Millers Ferry, and Claiborne Locks in association with previously contracted lock closure and repair work.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated in the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs and valve bulkheads to de-water the structures. This work can only be performed when the valves are dewatered.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  The contractor will already be on site to dewater and repair the lock and this work can be performed at the same time utilizing some of the same specialized equipment and personnel already on site.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing

1.0  Background

The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) has established a Technology Focus Team to assess the application of advanced mathematics to a number of DoD challenges.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has a critical need to apply and further advanced mathematics to our most pressing battlefield challenges, and develop new mathematics for the challenges of tomorrow. In order to address critical shortcomings associated with joint and coalition identification and tracking capabilities, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) established a Technology Focus Team to assess the application of advanced mathematics to a number of DoD challenges. These include: optimal sensor fusion for real-time target identification, feature extraction from dynamic data sets, novel visualization techniques in order to speed analysis of massive data, and battlefield identification.
1.1 Intent of the RFI
It is the intent of the DDR&E office to use this market research to develop recommendations for relevant state of the art and state of practice mathematical techniques that would significantly improve warfighting capability in these areas and to address critical warfighting capability gaps. 
2.0  Requirements
2.1 Description of the problem
Keeping track of the dense, cluttered battlespace, with fixed and movable objects, where enemy forces are frequently closely mingled with civilians, as well as tracking such things as Improved Explosive Devices (IEDs), Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), ground vehicles and dismounted soldiers is a difficult challenge for warfighters.  

US forces have a large number of sensors to keep track of enemy, friendly, and neutral battlefield objects.  These generate a variety of data types, such as: video, radar, infrared, acoustic, electronic intelligence, and others.  Data generated by one sensor often needs to be correlated with data from other sensors, especially if the data generated by the other sensor is of different types (e.g., video and acoustic).  The difficulty of managing all this data is increased by the fact that some of this data needs further processing in order to give unambiguous, time stamped, tracks and target state vectors.  The Joint Warfighter in Iraq and Afghanistan has been described as having the problem of swimming in sensors and drowning in data.  The lack of coherence among these systems can result in a confused, ambiguous picture of the battlefield, and the abundance of data has resulted in throwing some data away just to make screens readable.
2.2 Description of solution characteristics

To address this Joint Warfighter problem, the DoD is looking for recommendations for specific applications of advanced mathematics to manage and extract features from massive dynamic data sets, particularly pertaining to techniques that account for sparse, misordered, late arriving data, and missing data, to support identification and tracking of all objects in the battlespace.  Recommendations should include specific techniques for filtering, fusing, and visualizing high dimensional data sets.

To help the Joint Warfighter, some of the issues these advanced mathematical techniques should be designed to address include: 
-	Improved situational awareness
o	Do the objects exist?
o	What are the objects (identification)?
&#61607;	Friend, Neutral, Hostile, Unknown?
o	Where are the objects?  With what certainty?  Where are they headed? At what speed, in what direction, at what altitude, at what precise time, etc 
o	What is the intent of the objects?
o	What is the history of the objects?
o	Has a key event occurred?
o	What is the significance of the event?
o	What are the relationships between the objects, the events and the objects and events?
-	Effective cueing:
o	Same as Situational Awareness, but with a sufficiently low latency that supports engagement decisions
o	Requires updates to data on a continuous or rapid basis vs. slower updates ranging from minutes to seconds that is sufficient for situational awareness.
-	Effective targeting:
o	Same as Situational Awareness, but with a sufficiently low latency that supports engagement decisions and weapons targeting 
o	Requires updates to data on a continuous or rapid basis vs. slower updates ranging from minutes to seconds that is sufficient for situational awareness.
-	Provide a clear, continuous, unambiguous picture of the battlespace:
o	Clear, tracks have one track per target
o	Continuous: tracks that do not drop (e.g., by fusing multiple sensors, one sensor may fill in where another cannot see)
o	Unambiguous: certain identification
o	Additionally, error correction from look angles, etc must be accounted for.
-	Provide the ability to make shoot/no-shoot decisions on a large volume of uncorrelated, raw data, with uncertain and unassociated or misordered data
-	Provide significant improvement in multi-sensor association, correlation, and/or fusion, depending on the intended use (e.g., for cueing, targeting, etc.)

2.3 Connecting Operational Challenges to Potential Mathematical Solutions
-	A summary listing of the operational challenges warfighters face includes:
o	Tracking
o	Object Identification
o	Sensor Cuing
o	Determination of Object Intent
o	Distributed systems of diverse sensors
o	Sensor constraints (field of view, refresh rates, resolution, etc.)
o	Volume/diversity/distribution of data
o	Operator cognitive constraints
o	Constrained communications
o	Constrained platform computing capabilities

-	Some examples of possible applications of mathematical techniques to operational challenges include: 
Area of Focus	Problem (Application)
Data Fusion	Target Tracking  Low/Slow Air
	Target Tracking  Ground Movement
	Combat ID
	Compressive Sensing
	Signal Reconstruction
	Fusion Performance Assessment

 	Construction of High-level Representation of Information
 	Information Integration (interoperability)
 	Reuse and Update Current Systems
 	Information Flow and Exchange
Sensor Data & Network Architectures 	Coverage Guarantees and Hole Detection 
	Sleep/Wake scheduling for sensor networks 
	Dynamic network topology
	Quality of service

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC><p><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS</strong></span>. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is F1M3F10043A001ZPortal. The 437th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, requires all inclusive service and maintenance agreement for the Z-Portal Cargo and Vehicle Screening System located at Charleston AFB, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The 437th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to American Science and Engineering, Inc., 826 Middlesex Turnpike, BILLERICA, MA 01821. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement in the US.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read: The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to response to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the appointed due date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposal based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>AS&amp;E designed and built the Z Backscatter Portal. The A Backscatter "is one of a kind" piece of equipment designed to electronically X-Ray vehicle and cargo inspection for venicles entering the Charleston AFB which also meets the ANSI N43-17 "Radiation Safeth for Personnel Security Screening System." AS&amp;E has also designed the software that operates the Z Backscatter Portal and has it copyrighted. If the equipment was to breakdown and they were not at our disposal, it would adversely affect the mission. Award shall be made in the aggregate all or none.</p>
<p>AS&amp;E is the only known source that can satisfy the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to search the market for vendors who can provide services that will fulfill the preventive maintenance and repair requirements for the <br />Z-Portal System.</p>

Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance.  All subfactors under Factor I, Technical are of equal importance.  The Contracting Officer shall also conduct a price analysis in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2).  The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor III, Price.  However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.  The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than Acceptable must be achieved for Factor I, and its associated sub-factors (Understanding of Requirement, Key Personnel, and Corporate Experience).  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  <BR><BR>Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency.  Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f) (4), the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Offerors will be required to submit a technical and price proposal and will be evaluated against four evaluation factors.  To determine which firm represents the best value, the offers will be evaluated as outlined below.<BR><BR>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. FAR PART 13, SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES, ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUEREMENT. THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEIGN REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a request for quotation. The solicitation document incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.<br /><br /><br />1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)<br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. They must be received no later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334111 - Electronic Computer Manufacturing- with a size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement will be competed as a 100% small business set aside. This requirement is going to be competed only among authorized resellers of NVIDIA Tesla, Intel, and Microsoft that are considered small businesses under the NAICS code 334111.
<p>The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />52.212-1<br />52.212-3<br />52.212-4 <br />52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.219-6, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222.19, 522.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.225-13 and 52.232-33.<br /><br />The following standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this acquisition:<br />1194.21- Software Applications and Operating Systems <br />1194.26- Desktop and Portable Computers <br />1194.31- Functional Performance Criteria <br />1194.41- Information, Documentation, and Support</p>
<p>This procurement is a brand name procurement that involves more than one brand name product. First, the procurement is for Tesla supercomputer processors. This procurement also involves Intel processors. Finally, the procurement includes Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2. Below are the justifications for each brand name product.<br /><br />This section is a narrative describing the justification of the identification by name brand, of components manufactured by NVIDIA Corporation. To the best of our knowledge, the NVIDIA Tesla is the only supercomputing processor that is high-performance, and supports both OpenCL and CUDA. This will facilitate the development of software and libraries that are both optimizable and cross-platform (e.g., both a PC and Mac). Additionally, a number of NIST IT assets (such as MATLAB or LABVIEW) offer CUDA-based acceleration. Using a different GPU architecture would detract from NIST's ability to leverage the existing infrastructure. Likewise, it is specified that the video controller be based on NVIDIA technology. Using a video card that is manufactured by a different manufacturer would increase the number of device drivers to be loaded onto the system, increase the amount of maintenance, and add complexity if the video processor did not have the same basic architecture as the remaining GPU units. <br /><br />This section is a narrative describing the justification of the identification by name brand, of components manufactured by Intel. All desktop and server systems used in the NIST Biometric Clients Lab use Intel processors. The lab already has a significant investment, and experience in i7/Nehalem based processors. Using a different processor would have a significant negative impact on compatibility, maintenance, and support costs. (For example, existing spare processors already on hand can be used across machines with relatively homogeneous architectures.) Likewise, an Intel network chipset is required for similar reasons. The NIST Biometric Clients Lab already has an existing investment in network interfaces with an Intel chipset. Specifying an Intel networking chipset provides maximum compatibility and reuse of existing spare parts.<br /><br />This section is a narrative describing the justification of the identification by name brand, of components manufactured by Microsoft Corporation. The majority of systems used in the NIST Biometric Clients Lab are based on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Using an operating system other than Microsoft Windows would have a significant impact with respect to (a) compatibility with the remainder of the NIST Biometric Clients Lab IT infrastructure and (b) unnecessarily increase training, maintenance, and support costs.<br /><br />Description of Requirement:<br />This is a procurement for a supercomputer workstation to support activities at the intersection of biometric algorithm development and complex systems research. This will assist in the research for the NIST Information Access Division. The exact specifications for the supercomputing workstation are detailed in the attached document titled "List of Items Required and Optional Specifications." The estimated value of this procurement is within the range of $20,000 to $25,000.<br /><br />As described below, this procurement will be awarded on a "best value" basis.

<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: <br />The Government intends to use a tradeoff process to award a purchase order to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contract Specialist determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.<br /><br />Upon receipt of proposals, the Contract Specialist will review them to determine if each offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below. An offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the quotation being determined unacceptable. <br /><br />Evaluation Factors:<br />1. Degree to which the Minimum Specifications were Exceeded: The Government will evaluate the offer against a point scale that has been devised to assign a point value to each specification that has exceeded the minimum specifications. The document that details this point scale is attached to this solicitation.<br />2. Section 508 Compliance: The Government will evaluate the level of compliance that the products offered demonstrate with Section 508 law. The Government will only use documentation provided by the offeror as a basis for this evaluation. This documentation should be in the form of a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). <br />3. Evaluated Cost/Price: The Government will evaluate whether the quoted cost/price is fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements and the requirement's estimated value, and is consistent with the offer's specifications.</p>
<p>Non-Cost/Price factors 1 through 3 are listed in descending order of importance. Non-cost Factor 1 is considered to be the most heavily weighed factor. Non-cost Factor 2 is weighted less heavily than factor 1; and Factor 3 is considered to be approximately equal to Factors 1 and 2, when combined.<br /><br />The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government's interest.</p>
<p>The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br /><br />Exchanges with Offerors after receipt of a quotation do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR><BR>Technical, Past Performance and Price.<BR><BR>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are substantially more important than Price.  <BR> <BR>Provide the following information with your offer:<BR><BR>1.  Technical Written Proposal:  <BR><BR>1.1. Reference Attachment 1, Performance Based Work Statement, Specific Tasks, paragraph 9 that include subparagraphs 9.1 through 9.3.13.  Address Medical Transcription, Inpatient Medical Records/Coding, and Correspondence and File Clerk services.   <BR><BR>a. In accordance with PWS paragraphs 9.1 through 9.3.13 offerors proposal shall explain the management techniques and processes deemed necessary you will use to ensure satisfactory performance and, and timeliness if services. <BR>b. Additionally, offerors proposal shall include a Quality Control Plan (based on Attachment 2) that will ensure satisfactory performance.  <BR>c. The offerors proposal shall include appropriate staffing levels and labor categories based upon workload history provided in the Performance Based Work Statement and offerors proposal.<BR><BR>1.2. Reference Performance Based Work Statement, paragraphs 2.9, 2.9.1, 2.9.1.1 and 2.9.1.2.  The Project Supervisor will play an important role in ensuring successful performance.  <BR><BR>a. Offerors shall provide the resume of the actual proposed supervisor to demonstrate required qualifications which include AHIMA membership card and RHIA or RHIT certificate with ID number from AHIMA.<BR><BR>NOTE:  Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications of parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well-known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient.  Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your offer to receive a MARGINAL or an UNSATISFACTORY RATING.<BR><BR>The following adjectival terms were utilized to represent the rating of technical proposals:<BR><BR>EXCELLENT - The proposal demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and the approach significantly exceeds performance or capability standards. The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government. The proposal has no weaknesses.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.<BR><BR>GOOD - The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards. The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.   The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a good probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.<BR><BR>SATISFACTORY - The proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the requirements and the approach meets performance or capability standards. The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses.  Any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally meets requirements, with only a moderate risk to the Government. <BR><BR>MARGINAL - The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the proposal. The approach has weaknesses that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring.<BR><BR>UNSATISFACTORY - The proposal fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards. The proposal has major omissions and inadequate detail to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements. The proposal poses an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.<BR><BR>2. Past Performance:<BR><BR>   2.1. Provide the attached questionnaire (see Attachment 3) to two (2) firms where you are currently providing the same or similar Turn-Key operation that indicates your ability to satisfactorily perform the magnitude of this requirement.  Have the completed questionnaire sent directly to our office.  Also, provide the company name, telephone number, and Point of Contact that will provide your questionnaire with your offer.  If an offeror submits more than two Past Performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure the reference submits the completed Past Performance Questionnaire directly to the GPRCO by the closing date of this RFP.<BR><BR>  2.2. The government may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the government.  Offerors are reminded that while the government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete performance information rests with the offeror.	<BR><BR>In reaching a risk assessment for past performance, the following categories will be used:<BR><BR>a. High Risk  Significant doubt exists, based on the offerors performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR>b. Moderate Risk  Some doubt exists, based on the offerors performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR>c. Low Risk  Little doubt exists, based on the offerors performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR>d. Neutral  No performance record identifiable.  This is neither a negative or positive assessment.<BR><BR>3.  Price.<BR><BR>a. Proposals are limited to 25 pages or less. Offerors must submit their proposals via electronic mail to: Therese.newbauer@amedd.army.mil or Kenneth.tyson@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>b. Offerors MUST submit proposals on time.   Proposals received after the closing date of the RFP will NOT be considered for award.<BR><BR><BR>4.  Evaluation Process.  All quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria.<BR><BR>a. Each offeror will be evaluated on its overall Past and Present Performance under prior and existing contracts for the same or similar service as well as on its Technical Written Proposal.  Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price, and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the governments requirement.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate offerors prices on the basis of price realism and will consider the offerors price as an indication that they understand the scope and complexity of the Governments requirement.<BR><BR>b. The award decision will be based on the best value offered to the government and not solely on price and price related factors.  In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors.<BR><BR>c. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance. Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are substantially more important than price.  However, Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of the proposal is determined to be essentially equal, or if a proposal deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to be worth the high price premium.  The trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than low offeror.	<BR><BR>d. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of clause)<BR><BR><BR>Place of performance:<BR>Bayne Jones Army Hospital<BR>Direct Delivery<BR>US Army MEDDAC PBO<BR>7606 Virginia Ave Bldg 4372<BR>Ft Polk LA 71469-6000<BR>UNITED STATES<BR><BR>Point of Contact: Therese Newbauer, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-221-4820,<BR>Email therese.newbauer@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>Great Plains Regional Contracting Office<BR>MCAA GP BAMC<BR>Bldg 2539 Garden Ave and McIdoe<BR>Fort Sam Houston, TX  78234-6200<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Kenneth Tyson, Contracting Officer, (210) 221-4723<BR>Email kenneth.tyson@amedd.army.mil<BR>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Provide a list of no more than three (3) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract. Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survery will be provided to the references that you provide. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications. <br /><br />Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications. <br /><br />Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.<br /><br />The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each <br />company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, when determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, credentials, magnitude of work (meaning size of church, number of choirs, breadth of experience), flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs, ability of contractor to work and respond kindly to various types of people, and the ability to respond to needs that are specific to the Protestant Evangelical faith.</p>
<p>(d) Completed performance surveys are not to be reviewed by the offeror. ONCE THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED, IT IS CONSIDERED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, and is only viewed by Government personnel directly involved in the evaluation process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performnace information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.</p>

<p>Question:<br />I understand that you do not need drives. I just wanted to know what type of drives you were going to use. If your going to use SATA drives, the you would need MUX adaptors for those drives. If your going to use SAS drives then you would not need the MUX adaptors. If you do need them I can also quote those.</p>
<p>Will you need any cables or HBA cards quoted for this project?</p>
<p>Response:<br />We are using SAS drives so no need to quote the MUX cards. We do not need anything else.</p>

<p><strong><br />PROCUREMENT OBJECTIVE<br /><br /></strong>The objective of this Task Order is to establish Tissue Source Sites (TSS) to provide human tissues for biomedical research, one of the two main initiatives for the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), a pilot project of the NIH Roadmap. This effort will be organized within the National Cancer Institute's (NCI cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) to whom the samples will be shipped for quality evaluation and use by the Laboratory component of GTEx.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW OF THE GTEX PROJECT</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Purpose of the GTEx Project</span></p>
<p>The GTEx project, a NIH Roadmap Initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. By treating global RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, loci with polymorphisms that are highly correlated with variations in expression will be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs. The SNPs within the eQTL that are correlated with gene expression are sometimes called eSNPs. Based on analysis of individual tissues, 4% or more of gene transcripts have cis-eQTLs, operationally defined as an eSNP that is located close to the gene whose expression it is correlated with. To identify trans-eQTLs, in which the eSNP maps far from the gene or on a different chromosome from the gene it is regulating, much larger numbers of samples relative to cis-eQTLs, will be required to achieve a statistically significant association. This is due to the need to adjust for the large number of statistical tests involved in searching for correlation between expression levels of every transcript and a very large number of genetic variants. Comprehensive identification of both cis- and trans-eQTLs will provide a valuable basis on which to study gene regulation with an immediate application in interpreting GWAS study findings.</p>
<p><br />The GTEx project will begin with a 2.5-year, 3-phased pilot in FY10. As developed at a June 2008 GTEx Workshop (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/workshop0608), the primary goal of the overall pilot is to assess the feasibility of enrolling 160 deceased donors identified through low post-mortem-interval (PMI) autopsy or organ/tissue transplant settings and collecting high-quality RNA from multiple tissues per donor. The precise number of tissues that yield high-quality RNA that can be collected from each donor is not known. The aim of this project is to collect as many different tissue types as is practical, ideally between 50 to 70, and to analyze gene expression in at least 50 tissues per donor.</p>

?FUNGAL INSPECTION REPORT1/28/2009Report prepared for:Jim KnoelkeFacility Manager - District OperationsYellowstone National Park
On January 21, 2010, a fungal inspection and subsequent indoor air quality tests were performed at 376 Lower Mammoth to validate the success of recent cleaning in response to the previous report.
ObservationsThe indoor air quality analysis shows that three out five of the rooms tested had elevated spore counts above the previous tested levels. The boy's bedroom and the master bedroom showed slight improvement in the air quality after cleaning was completed.
RecommendationsAll surfaces throughout the residence should be cleaned by a professional remediation company. This should also include cleaning of all contents, in place, room by room along with the structural cleaning. This cleaning should be completed with the forced air heating system turned off. Supplemental heating can be accomplished by use of the wood stove as needed. Airscrubbers should be utilized to capture any airborne particulates. These scrubbers should be used simply for that purpose and not as negative air machines. Once the structural and content cleaning has been completed, the furnace and entire ventilation system should be professionally cleaned. Cleaning of the structure and contents shall follow all guidelines as outlined in the most recently published "S520 Standard for Mold Remediation" published by the Institute for the Inspection, Cleaning, and Restoration Certifications(IICRC). Also, a continuous sealed vapor barrier should be installed over all dirt surfaces in the crawlspace.
Once complete, follow up air quality testing should be completed to verify success of remediation. If spore levels remain high after this work is complete, then further investigation may be necessary to identify the possibility of contamination within the exterior walls.
?FUNGAL INSPECTION REPORT1/28/2009Report prepared for:Jim KnoelkeFacility Manager - District OperationsYellowstone National Park
On January 21, 2010, a fungal inspection and subsequent indoor air quality tests were performed at 380 Lower Mammoth to identify the possible presence of fungal contamination.
ObservationsThe residence appears to be kept very clean. It did not have as serious of a problem with condensation in the windows as was observed in other residences. A small amount of apparent fungal growth was observed in the bathroom shower. This fungal growth was identified microscopically as Aureobasidium. Water damage around the windows was not obvious as in other units.
The indoor air quality analysis showed moderate to highly elevated spore counts in all areas tested. The basement(6480), living room(4253), master bedroom(3440) and guest bedroom(3053) are all elevated above the outside (background) sample of 640 spores per cubic meter of air. These results can be seen on the spore trap analysis report. Relative humidity levels were within acceptable standards for this region.Relative Humidity & Temperatures(taken during inspection)
Location		Relative Humidity	Temperature (Fahrenheit)
Master Bedroom	36.7%			69.1 degreesLiving Room		37.0%			69.4 degreesBasement		42.6%			64.5 degreesGuest Bedroom	37.2%			69.1 degreesOutside		22.7%			28.0 degrees
RecommendationsLiving Area:All surfaces throughout the residence should be cleaned by a professional remediation company. This should also include cleaning of all contents, in place, room by room along with the structural cleaning. This cleaning should be completed with the forced air heating system turned off. Supplemental heating can be accomplished by electrical space heaters as needed. Airscrubbers should be utilized to capture any airborne particulates. These scrubbers should be used simply for that purpose and not as negative air machines. Once the structural and content cleaning has been completed, the furnace and entire ventilation system should be professionally cleaned.

<CONTACT>Stephanie E Fugate, Contracting Officer, Email stephanie.fugate@do.treas.gov
<DESC><strong>The last paragraph is hereby amended to reflect the correct website as </strong><a href="http://www.treasuryota.us"><strong>www.treasuryota.us</strong></a><strong>. <br /></strong><br />The U.S. Treasury Department Office of Technical Assistance is recruiting experienced professionals in the areas of Revenue Policy and Revenue Administration on a competitive basis for both resident and/or intermittent assignments under personal services contracts. This announcement is for Global Technical Assistance assignments. We are recruiting for assignments in Africa, Asia, and South and Central America. We have specific interest in revenue administration specialists interested in assignments in Western Hemisphere countries (including but not limited to Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras), and Eastern Hemisphere countries (including but not limited to Algeria, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lesotho, Liberia, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, Indonesia, Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, and Vietnam). Intermittent assignments can normally be expected to range in duration from three to six weeks in support of existing revenue projects. Applicants must be able to receive a State Department medical clearance and be willing to accept global assignments requiring significant and often arduous international travel. <em>Resident assignments may place advisors in a host country for one year or more.</em> <br />
<p><strong><br />QUALIFICATIONS:</strong> Treasury is seeking candidates who possess expertise in revenue policy and revenue administration. Revenue administration experts should have strong experience in any of the following areas of revenue administration: tax and revenue administration law, executive management, audit, internal audit / inspections, collection, customs, returns processing, tax forms design, taxpayer service and education, public affairs and media relations, human resources, training, and IT systems. Revenue policy experts should possess experience in the review, analysis and development of revenue and tax policy proposals, in the drafting and review of revenue laws and regulations, and the review and analysis of the economic impact of tax and fiscal policy changes. Certain assignments require candidates to have significant project management experience, to include the ability to prepare project work plans, statements of work and manage human resources. Prior foreign technical assistance work and knowledge of a foreign language are highly desirable, but not required. <em><strong>There is a special interest at this time in individuals with both technical skills and bilingual fluency in Spanish/English, French/English, and Portuguese/English.</strong></em> In addition to technical skills, we are looking for individuals with outstanding communication skills, capable of listening to the client and then providing effective oral and written responses.</p>
<p><strong>Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SALARY AND BENEFITS:</strong> Salaries are negotiable in accordance with government regulations based on demonstrated salary history and market comparability of similar positions. <em>The salary range is from 102,721 to 162,900, subject to January 1, 2010 cost of living adjustments. Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.</em> Successful applicants will be subject to a background security investigation at the appropriate level and medical clearances. <em>This announcement is open and continuous until June 30, 2010, although selections may be made in advance of that date based on program needs.</em> Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recruitment@ota.treas.gov</span> or by mail to U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N.W. - 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge and Government labor shortages in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  Urgency and termination issues are sometimes difficult to address as they relate to temporary hiring of Government employees and the bureaucracy and governing labor regulations.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a stop-gap measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDCs current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects in DLA/DDC locations across the Continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  

The DDC is seeking offerors to perform the above functions which will be evaluated utilizing a Lowest Price / Technically Acceptable source selection procedure. This procurement will be set-aside for a contractor qualified in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, using competitive procedures.  DDC released a DRAFT solicitation on 14 January 2010.  The issuance of the final solicitation has been postponed.  The DDC will update this synopsis with a revised date prior to issuing the final solicitation. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with cost reimbursement (no fee) contract line items.  The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs as well as travel/training/conference costs will be reimbursed under the cost reimbursement (no fee) portion.  The Government intends to issue a single award from the solicitation.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four one-year options. 

A pre-proposal conference is expected to be conducted at DDC.  Time and locations will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website. 

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are: 493110 and $25.5 million, respectively. 

All documents to this solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://wwww.fedbizopps.gov/) under solicitation SP3300-10-R-0009.

<DESC>Recovery Project Site Viewing, Anthony Lakes Highway Road 73 Reconstruction, 
Wallowa-Whitman NF

Draft Project Overview

The following project description will, most definitely, change between now and when the solicitation is advertised, but due to the season in which this solicitation will be advertised, this project is being announced so that potential offerors may visit the site and ensure conditions are seen before the snow covers the project area.  

There will be no scheduled showing trips nor will a Forest Service employee be available to accompany prospective bidders to the site. However, bidders are reminded that is is their responsiblity to determine for themselves the actual site conditions and only by physical inspection, on-the-ground viewing can offerors assure themselves of the existing conditions. Maps are available at the Whitman Ranger District office. Thank you.

The set aside has not been determined.

The Anthony Lakes Highway project is approximately 10 miles long, and is one of the higher standard paved roads on the Forest.  The project requires, but is not limited to construction staking, clearing and grubbing, slope rounding, excavation, slope scaling, drainage structures, culverts, geo-textile, riprap, aggregate, pit development, asphalt re-surfacing, hydro seeding and mulching, signs, and temporary traffic control.  In addition, there are utilities buried in the road that need to be protected.

The project is divided into four (4) segments.  Segment A (6.13 mi.) requires crack sealing, and a chip seal over the existing asphalt surface.  Segment B (2.55 mi.) requires pulverizing the existing asphalt, adding base aggregate and repaving with new hot mix asphalt.  Segment C (0.21 mi.) requires sub-excavating the road and replacing the road structure with geo-textile material, base and surface aggregate, and repaving with hot mix asphalt.  Segment D (0.60 mi.) also requires crack sealing and a chip seal.

There are four (4) design sections that will address cut slope stabilization.  These sections target cut slopes by either benching the existing slope or reconstructing the cut slope to a gentler ratio.  The remaining cut slope stabilization sections will be addressed by slope scaling.

Excavation from the design sections, slope scaling sections, and slope rounding will be utilized in the Anthony Lakes Ski Run parking lot expansion (Sta. 477+50), and the Anthony Snow Park parking lot expansion (Sta. 513+80).  Stump disposal, wood chip, and excavation waste area are located on Rd. 7300140 (Sta. 440+97).  Additional alternative excavation waste areas may be utilized at (Sta. 509+00), and Anthony Lakes Ski Run bunny hill re-contouring (Sta. 484+50) if needed.

To further stabilize the cut slopes, hydro seeding, and wood chip mulch will be placed on the cut slopes to provide erosion control.

The project may be reached starting from Baker City, Oregon by traveling NW on State Hwy. 30 approximately 9 miles to Haines, Oregon. Then travel West on County Road 1124 approximately 15 miles to the beginning of the Anthony Lakes Highway Reconstruction Project at Forest Boundary. 

Thank you

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">*IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT*<br /></span><br />BIDDER'S TELECONFERENCE </strong></p>
<p><strong>A PREPROPOSAL TELECONFERENCE WILL BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 26, 2010 AT 1:00 P.M. (EST). This call will provide Offerors the opportunity to ask additional questions and receive answers in a &lsquo;live' venue. Offerors wishing to participate in this teleconference shall dial 1-800-366-7242 and enter passcode 546570 when prompted.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /><br />PROCUREMENT OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>This Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is being solicited to identify a pool of qualified candidates for BOA award to facilitate contracting for future work in support of both The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). It is intended that multiple BOA awards will be made so that future Task Orders may be competed among the pool of qualified BOA holders.</p>
<p><strong>Offerors responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP) are also encouraged to respond to RFP No. S10-120 for caHUB Acquisition of Normal Tissues in Support of the GTEX Project that is also currently posted to </strong><a href="http://www.fbo.gov"><strong>www.fbo.gov</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp; RFP No. S10-120 represents the first Task Order issued under the umbrella of this BOA.<br /><br />RFP No. S10-120&nbsp;may be found at URL: </strong><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=468505e53f516bf50e18581a7f139d43&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0"><strong>https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=468505e53f516bf50e18581a7f139d43&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0</strong></a><strong>. <br /></strong><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute is expanding funding of basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on the sufficient availability of high quality biospecimens and associated data suitable for use in its research programs.</p>
<p>The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB, http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/cahub/) is a targeted effort to establish a centralized, world class cancer tissue resource, Pathology Resource Center, and associated infrastructure. caHUB has a mission to accelerate biomedical and translational cancer research by ensuring the adequate and continuous supply of high-quality, highly annotated human biospecimens. caHUB will create a collection of diseased and normal biospecimens to support a broad range of scientific needs. caHUB will support collaborative research combining the power of multiple analytical platforms and technologies across the same set of highly qualified and characterized biospecimens. With caHUB and the research and development that caHUB will support, the NCI's overarching goal is to improve the ability to diagnose, prognosticate, treat, develop new and novel therapeutics, and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Normal human tissues are essential to the study of cancer and other diseases. The National Institutes of Health's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a NIH Roadmap initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. caHUB will acquire normal tissues for the GTEx project through contracts with organizations such as rapid autopsy programs, organ and tissue transplant programs, surgical tissue procurement programs, and medical examiner programs.</p>
<p>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is to solicit technical capabilities responses from entities that have the ability to serve as a Tissue Source Site (TSS), providing clinically annotated normal human biospecimens to caHUB and GTEx.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>To meet caHUB and GTEx project goals, SAIC-F will award one or more Basic Ordering Agreements to organizations capable of accruing and delivering targeted normal biospecimens and their associated clinical data. The biospecimens and data will be delivered to caHUB for quality control, extensive pathology characterization, diagnostic verification, processing into molecular analytes, storage, other relevant processes, and distribution for qualified research and development.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that organizations providing technical capabilities proposals in response to this solicitation may include, among others:<br /><br />&bull; Dedicated Rapid Autopsy Programs<br />&bull; Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs)<br />&bull; Tissue Recovery Organizations (TROs)<br />&bull; Medical Examiners<br />&bull; Surgical Tissue Procurement Programs</p>

<SOLNBR>ORNL-185
<ARCHDATE>04302010
<CONTACT>Pat Smith, Phone 865-574-2883, Fax 865-241-5503, Email smithpr1@ornl.gov - Jeremy R. Duncan, Subcontract Administrator, Phone 8655760477, Email duncanjr@ornl.gov
<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span><br />The Magnet Systems Team of the US ITER Project Office is responsible for delivering the Central Solenoid (CS) Magnet System to ITER, an international collaboration head-quartered in Cadarache, France. The project is being designed and built by the ITER partners: the European Union, India, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States. US project responsibilities will be accomplished through a collaboration of DOE laboratories, universities, and industry. The U.S. ITER Project Office is hosted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with partner labs Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Savannah River National Laboratory. <br />From Latin for "the way", ITER has the goal of demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of extracting net power from a burning, fusion plasma. Achieving this burning plasma requires the resolution of complex physics issues and the integration of new and improved technologies. ITER is designed to be the premier scientific tool for exploring and testing expectations for plasma behavior in the burning-plasma regime, wherein the fusion process itself provides the dominant heat source to sustain the plasma temperature. The fusion power from this machine will be up to ten times greater than the total external power required for operating the machine and heating its plasma. As such, it will provide the scientific basis and plasma-control tools needed to move toward commercial power from fusion energy.<br /><br />The United States is an equal, non-host partner, responsible for about 9% of the construction cost of ITER. As such, it will contribute hardware components, personnel, cash, and contingency during the construction phase of the project. The CS magnet system will be a major part of the US-contributed hardware.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span>The CS Magnet System is very large superconducting magnet system that will be comprised of a stack of 6 Modules and the External Structure that holds them all together and supports them during operation. A total of 7 CS modules will be manufactured, with one serving as a spare. All modules will be delivered to the ITER Site, Cadarache, France, along with the External Structure and special tooling for assembly.<br /><br />The CS Modules will be constructed from Nb3Sn-based, cable-in-conduit conductors supplied by the Japanese Team in lengths of either 600 or 900 meters each (and weights of about 11 or 16 metric tons, respectively). Each module will weigh approximately 110 metric tons when finished, and when assembled, the total system will be approximately 18 meters tall and weigh around 900 metric tons. When charged to full current of 45 kilo-amperes, the assembly will produce fields of over 12 Tesla and will store over 6 Giga-Joules of energy. Terminal-to-terminal operating voltages up to 14 kilo-volts are expected. The superconducting-magnet technologies embodied in the ITER CS Magnet System are essential to future fusion reactors but may also be regarded as enabling technologies for future large superconducting magnetic systems.<br /><br />The design of the CS Magnet System is presently in an advanced conceptual-design stage. The project is now ready to begin preliminary design.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquisition Plan<br /></span>An acquisition plan has been developed. The main elements of the acquisition plan are as follows:<br />&bull; The US Domestic Agency (DA) is responsible for the design of the CS modules, structures, and assembly tooling and for the assembly procedures<br />&bull; Industrial vendors will be selected after final design to provide the CS structures and assembly tooling <br />&bull; Study contracts will be placed with potential industrial vendors for the CS structures and assembly tooling to assist the US DA design and planning efforts<br />&bull; Long lead materials for the CS structures will be procured by the US DA before the completion of final design and provided to the industrial vendors as government furnished equipment (GFE)<br />&bull; An industrial vendor will be selected as soon as possible to provide the CS module fabrication<br />&bull; The US DA will develop (with industry support) critical fabrication processes prior to award of the CS module fabrication contract and transfer this technology to the industrial vendor<br />&bull; Study contracts will be placed with potential industrial vendors for the CS modules as needed to assist the US DA design, manufacturing development, and planning efforts until the production contract is awarded<br />Schedules for acquiring the CS modules, structures, and assembly are illustrated in the attached figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Look Forward at ITER CS Business Opportunities</span><br />The purpose of this announcement is to identify prospective vendors to support this acquisition plan through assisting in CS design and planning activities, providing structural materials, and fabricating the CS modules, structures, and assembly tooling.<br /><br />To provide early information about the ITER CS design, fabrication, and future business opportunities, <strong>a vendor conference will be held on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 7, 2010</span></strong> in Oak Ridge, TN. At this conference, the CS acquisition plan, along with details of the project schedule and the design and fabrication effort will be presented and discussed. Potential suppliers for CS modules, structures, assembly tooling, and bulk materials are encouraged to attend. Feedback from prospective vendors on the acquisition plan is sought.<br /><br /><strong>Registration for the vendor conference is required before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 5, 2010</span>. Please register with Pat Smith, US ITER Contracts Assistant, by COB, March 5, 2010. (Pat Smith, 1055 Commerce Park, MS 6483, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831-6483, smithpr1@ornl.gov, 865 574-2883).</strong> Registration by e-mail is preferred. Company name, number and names of potential attendees, and country of citizenship are required. Attendees that are not United States citizens must also provide their date of birth and country of birth. If you are unable to attend but are interested in future CS business opportunities, please contact Pat Smith.<br /><br />Procurement of the CS modules will begin with the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) in August 2010 and contract award in March 2011. This will be a contract for a single vendor (or team) for the fabrication of the CS modules.<br />Preliminary design will be in progress during the period of this solicitation. Manufacturing input into CS module design and planning efforts during this period will be arranged through individual study contracts or through Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) with task orders for specific studies. Prospective suppliers for the CS modules are encouraged to participate in these study contracts, or BOAs, for providing manufacturing input. <br /><br />Procurement of the CS structures will begin following final design with the release of the RFP in May 2013 and contract award in October 2013. These will be contracts with one or more vendors for the fabrication of CS structures.<br />The design of the CS structures may entail the use of hundreds of tons of high strength stainless steel. To avoid lengthy schedule delays, we plan to procure much of this material in advance and provide it to the structure fabricators as government furnished equipment (GFE). The RFP for this procurement will be released midway through final design in February 2012 with contract award in June 2012.<br /><br />The US DA is responsible for providing any special purpose assembly tooling needed to assemble the CS modules and structures into a single unit. Procurement of the CS assembly tooling will begin following final design with the release of the RFP in January 2013 and contract award in June 2013. These will be contracts with one or more vendors for the fabrication of CS assembly tooling.<br /><br />Procurement of the CS structures and assembly tooling will not occur until after final design is completed. As with the CS modules, manufacturing input into CS structures and assembly tooling design and planning efforts during this period will be arranged through individual study contracts or through Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with task orders for specific studies. Prospective suppliers for the CS structures and assembly tooling are encouraged to participate in these study contracts or BOAs for providing manufacturing input.<br /><br />We thank you for your interest in the potential ITER CS business opportunities.</p>

<SOLNBR>SAQMMA09R0356
<CONTACT>William T. Schaeffer, Contract Specialist, Phone 5712269619, Email schaefferwt@state.gov
<DESC>Synopsis: The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is looking for sources to provide training facilities and qualified instructor personnel in support of the Office of Anti Terrorism Assistance. The US Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Training Directorate, Office of Antiterrorism Assistance (DS/T/ATA) manages the antiterrorism assistance program. ATA assists foreign partners to develop the capability for antiterrorism planning and coordination and commitment to support US counterterrorism objectives. This includes coordinating, synchronizing, implementing and expanding training and technical assistance programs; sharing technology with foreign partners; establishing or strengthening alliances and/or agreements, regional partnerships, and security assistance programs; promoting interagency cooperation among foreign government security and law enforcement forces; and supporting exchange programs. The program&rsquo;s geographic reach is extensive, having trained over 61,000 foreign police and civilian security officials in over 152 countries since inception in 1983. Country assistance plans are implemented through advanced training, technical assistance, and equipment grants including computers and software. Capacity building projects are tailored to the needs of each Partner Nation. DS/T/ATA requires contractor support for ATA&rsquo;s specialized foreign assistance mission. This contract will support the ATA office in conducting foreign law enforcement training and related activities, both domestic and overseas. A solicitation will be issued to select multiple ( two) prime contractors. Contractors must be US companies based in the United States. Contractor will provide overseas and domestic instructor-led training; specialized and advanced technical assistance; domestic training facilities; and training-related support services. This contract is unclassified. No facilities security clearances or personal security clearances are required. While no personal security clearances are required, instructor personnel will require some type of vetting which we expect will be short of what is required for a moderate risk, public trust determination. ATA has a course portfolio of approximately 50 courses with 325 scheduled events each year. During any given week, ATA can be conducting 10-20 courses worldwide. Approximately 85 percent of the courses are taught overseas. The remaining courses are taught domestically and will require training and support facilities within the 48 contiguous States. DS anticipates release of a finalized RFP in December 2009 and contract award by the end of March 2010. **** NOTE: The anticipated release date for the finalized RFP has been delayed. The new release date is expected on or before March 15, 2010 and contract award date is expected on or before June 15, 2010. ****

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Spokane VAMC2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of temporary radiology transcription services for a time period of 90 days.3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The contractor shall provide medical transcription services of dictated material for the Spokane, WA VA Medical Center (hereafter referred to as VA, VAMC, or the government) seven days a week, 24 hours a day, within prescribed turn-around-times.  Contractor will transcribe reports utilizing headers and footers and appropriate formats.  All dictated reports shall be transcribed off line and then up loaded directly into VISTA.  Reports shall be uploaded into VISTA in a timely manner as to meet the required turn-around-times identified in the contract.  Batch uploading is not allowed.4.  Statutory Authority:  	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;	(  )  (4) International Agreement	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;	(  )  (6) National Security; or	(  )  (7) Public Interest5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: Radiology transcription services are a very important clinical support service that can affect patient care and safety.  All Radiology Transcription services for the Spokane VAMC would cease if we could not obtain this bridging contract.  VISN 20 is currently soliciting for a network wide contract which is scheduled for award prior to May 31, 2010.  Due to clinical requirements and patient safety issues the Spokane VAMC needs to issue a bridge temporary radiology transcription service contract to fill a three month gap (or until the VISN contract is awarded). 6.  Actions to Promote Competition: None at this time.  With only a three (3) month gap, it does not make sense to set up another vendor in the VISTA system and complete a background investigation.  It would take considerable time to complete these processes and would cause radiology transcription services to cease during this time period, creating a patient safety issue.7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 24,000 for three months.  Pricing has been offered at the current rate from CMT.  This rate has been determined fair and reasonable based on past competition.8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  None.9.  Other Considerations: FAR 6.302-2 (b) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result serious injury, financial or other to the Government"; Radiology Transcription services are a critical patient care and safety service.10.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  ___________________________________________	________________________Randall Barkley, Radiology Supervisor	Date	11.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.___________________________________________	________________________Jackie Merriman, Contracting Officer	Date12.  Acquisition Manager's Review and Approval:  I have reviewed the foregoing justification and find it to be complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and recommend approval for other than full and open competition.___________________________________________	________________________John Kopp, East Branch Acquisition Manager	Date

This is for the continuation of a current ongoing contract.

The contract will be for a one year period period and a new contract is anticipated.   There is no solicitation number, for reference use Contract Number W81XWH07P0864. This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for a competitive quote. Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Government's requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government. (See Justification and Approval.)  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice. The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is: Kristen.Trump@us.army.mil.
