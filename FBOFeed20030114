<SUBJECT>B--Intention to Award Sole Source for Accouting Support for Office of Historical Trust Accounting
<SOLNBR>04-03-AN-70603
<RESPDATE>011903
<ARCHDATE>01142004
<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox Contract Specialist 7037871362     Wallace.Adcox@mms.gov;
<DESC>REFERENCE NUMBER 04-03-AN-70603. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. Gov.Works on behalf of the U.S. Department of Interior's Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) announces its intention to award a sole source contract to KPMG LLP for approximately $900,000. The contractor shall provide  general support and expertise on the Individual Indian Money (IIM) trust fund, Tribal accounts, and IIM operations as well as general accounting and historical accounting information and analysis. KPMG shall also prepare reviews, analysis, and reports on the IIM and Tribal accounts, documents, financial records, and IIM-related computer systems. KPMG is assuming responsiblilty for work that was to be performed under a contract with Arthur Andersen. The Arthur Andersen contract was terminated by the Government in 2002. The Government has an urgent and compelling need to continue the work begun by Arthur Andersen. KPMG has the expertise and experience in the form of personnel intimately familiar with the work to step in for Arthur Andersen  KPMG is uniquely suited for this requirement because their personnel have developed extensive experience in the context of the Cobell v. Norton litigation under a contract with Arthur Andersen that was terminated by the Government. Over the past six years, these individuals have gained valuable insight into the organization of the physical records relevant to the litigation, the unique characteristics of the electronic records underlying the IIM Trust and the unique and demanding history of this case. Specifically, these personnel have: 1. Played a critical role in the "Paragraph 19" document search, collection and production in support of the Department of the Interior 2. Provided similar services in support of the Department of Treasury. 3. Completed a detailed analysis of the electronic accounting system (the Integrated Records Management System, or "IRMS") used for administering the Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust funds. 4. Performed various descriptive statistical analyses and system descriptive reports for relating to the management of IIM funds 5. Reviewed critical account holder information in order to quantify pertinent information, and carried out numerous analyses of IRMS transactional data. Urgent and compelling reasons dictate the limitation of competition due to the critical nature of the Indian trust reform efforts and the Cobell litigation.  The Department of Interior is not only operating under congressionally mandated Indian trust reform initiatives, GAO oversight, court oversight, and court ordered deadlines, but most importantly, under a Secretarial Order charging the Office of the Special Trustee with the responsibility of implementing all trust reform efforts within the Department of the Interior (see Secretarial Order no. 3232, July,10 2001).  Such court oversight and court-monitoring efforts of all Trust Reform projects strongly support the use of the unusual and compelling justification. In addition, the resolution or remedy of the four court declared breaches of the Government's fiduciary responsibility toward Indian beneficiaries (see Cobell v. Norton 81 F. Supp. 2d 1, D.D.C 1999) is also a critical piece in this litigation and to the Government's defense in these proceedings. Thus delays or failures in meeting any of the trust reform initiatives and the four court declared breaches could seriously damage the Government's position both in terms of costs and liability.  Further, on January 6, 2003, OHTA submitted its plan for carrying out the historical accounting to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plan responded to the court's direction to the Department of Interior to accomplish a complete and accurate accounting of IIM funds. Shortly after the submission of the plan, OHTA will begin this massive accounting enterprise by focusing on the accounts held by Alaska Natives. OHTA will utilize the three CPA firms currently under contract to begin this work. It is essential to have a fourth firm engaged in order that OHTA can meet the milestones set out for the court in the accounting plan. By engaging KPMG, OHTA will be able to take advantage of personnel who already have extensive experience with IIM issues, and would not have to "get up to speed," so to speak, before it could work on equal terms with the other three firms.  The period of performance would be 12 months. Firms that believe they can provide the required items and services described above should identify themselves in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such firms must submit supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the stated requirements. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. Inquiries will only be accepted by fax at (703) 787-1009. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to continue data collection through the CDC-funded surveillance registry non-occupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) in the United States, actively solicit case-reports to the registry, and provide data for analysis and technical reports on the frequency and types of non-occupational exposures to HIV, offers and acceptance rates of antiretroviral therapy to attempt interruption of transmission, and clinical course and outcomes of persons with documented HIV exposure.  These data will augment ongoing programmatic and research efforts to reduce unanticipated, non-occupational exposures which place persons at risk of HIV transmission and to evaluate the utilization patterns and efficacy of antiretroviral therapy for post-exposure proprhylaxis in these exposures.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative proposals for research on various aspects of asynchronous (also known as "clockless") logic in support of the Clockless Logic, Analysis, Synthesis, and Systems (CLASS) program.  The emphasis of the CLASS program is on the development of asynchronous digital logic integrated circuit design techniques that overcome issues with the dominant synchronous (clocked) design methodology.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  1. Asynchronous Global Interconnect Methods, and 2. Asynchronous Logic Circuit Design Methods.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-05 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Clockless Logic program will consist of a Phase I effort (6 months) followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (12 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards are expected to be made during the last quarter of fiscal year 2003.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Robert Reuss, phone: (703) 696-2214, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: rreuss@darpa.mil

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 03-05, Clockless Logic, Analysis, Synthesis, and Systems (CLASS), Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on the objectives of CLASS BAA, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original hardcopy of the proposal, 5 hardcopies and 2 electronic copies (i.e. 2 separate disks) of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable each on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-05, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy _ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-05) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Wednesday, March 12, 2003 in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-05 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in CLASS. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-05.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<DESC>THIS ITEM PREVIOUSLY POSTED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER F08635-03-R-0003.  The Precision Strike System Program Office (SPO), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB, Florida is issuing a sources sought synopsis in response to the need for an aerial decoy, in relation to the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission.  The Precision Strike SPO plans to contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of a low cost, expendable, air launched vehicle that can present the radar signature and operational flight profile characteristics of a fighter/bomber/attack aircraft with sufficient fidelity to stimulate, deceive and decoy threat Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).  The aerial decoy is anticipated to be the first in the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) system family.  Provisions for spiral development of a stand-in jammer to counter early warning, acquisition, and fire control radar systems must be considered.  The short duration, expendable, low cost nature of the vehicle should be considered first in application of existing technology to the various vehicles.  It is desired that the physical appearance of all MALD family vehicles (decoy, jammer, etc.) appear to be identical to the casual observer.  As a threshold, the vehicle will be capable of being carried on and launched from a USAF B-52H bomber and F-16C/D fighter aircraft with objective carriage on the F-15C-E, B-1B, C-130, A/OA-10, B-2, F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  Any requirement for communication between the host aircraft and the MALD will be design dependent. A cost type contract for SDD is planned for award in the third quarter of FY03, and will be of approximately 60 months duration including 24 months of seamless verification .  The end product will be a low cost, producible, expendable decoy.   The development contract will contain an option for a 150 unit Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase prior to proceeding to a full rate production decision.  The acquisition strategy objective is to use, wherever possible, already developed and mature technologies and components in order to achieve a low cost and timely solution.  The most current MALD documents have been placed in the on line data exchange system - ATIMS for review and will be updated on a continuing basis.  Access to ATIMS is through the website http://atims.hill.af.mil.  A Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) and subsequently a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Government Website www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Program Office anticipates the release of the DRFP approximately 60 days from this announcement.  Interested firms are requested to submit information outlining their capabilities no later than 15 days after publication of this notice to Ms. Karen Schutt, AAC/WMGK, 102 W "D" Ave, Suite 300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808 or by email at karen.schutt@eglin.af.mil.  Contractual questions should be addressed to Ms. Karen Schutt, Contract Specialist (850) 882-9514, ext 2243 or Mr. Statia McNeese, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-9514, ext. 2115.

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on design-build factors that include:  FACTOR A-Past Performance, 1-Design Team, and 2-Construction Team; FACTOR B-Small Business Effort (Phase I); FACTOR C-Technical Qualifications, 1-Design Team and 2-Construction Team; and FACTOR D-Management Approach.

The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend the period of performance for support services from Scientific Technology Inc.,located 205 Perry Parkway in Gaithersburg, MD.  The period of performance for the extension is April 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003. Scientific Technology Inc. supports the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment(GLOBE) project. GLOBE is a hands on program that joins students, educators, and scientists from around the world in studying the global environment. Scientific Technology provides support through a number of public-private partnerships, including those with 97 countries and approximately 150 organizations in the United States. Scientific Technology provides GLOBE-certified master trainers to support NASA, as well as, the provision of scientific instruments and supplies.  These items are provided by the U.S. Government under its national and international partnership agreements. NASA is working to transition GLOBE via a competitive Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) to a cooperative agreement recipient. Any disruption to program operations during the transition period, could irreparably jeopardize the on-going success and even viability of GLOBE.     The authority for this sole source is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. NASA requires continuous and uninterrupted support for the GLOBE program until the follow-on cooperative agreement is awarded.  Service provided by Scientific Technology Inc. is required to maintain continuity of service, and avoid substantial duplication of cost to the Government associated with awarding two competitive procurements for the same requirement.  This duplicated cost is not expected to be recovered through competition. Unacceptable delays are also anticipated; any new contractor would have to implement new processes and standards for fulfilling the agency's requirements without the benefit of a long-term contract to amortize start up cost. There would be a significant learning curve and expense for another contractor to become capable of providing scientific instruments and provide training for NASA's partners. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time within 15days of the publication of this synopsis.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on behalf of the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Only One Source Reasonably Available with DRIVESOFT LLC, 4813 Wayside Drive, Old Hickory, TN  37138-3973 for the High Flux Backscattering Spectrometer (HFBS) data acquisition system upgrade.  The NCNR HFBS is one of the highest intensity instruments of its kind in the world and is unique in the U.S.  It provides information previously unobtainable on polymer thin films, semiconductor materials, fuel cells, and much more. Applications are numerous and include molecular reorientations, dynamics of adsorbed systems, and viscous liquids.  The existing data acquisition system utilizes a VME-based Motorola digital signal processor (DSP).  A VME single board computer manages the DSP by loading new programs and mediating interaction with a Linux-based host computer.  The intent of the upgrade is to retain use of a DSP, but eliminate dependence on a single board computer.
This sole source determination is based on the following:  (1)  The existing data acquisition system was procured through DRIVESOFT, LLC;  (2)  DRIVESOFT, LLC is uniquely and demonstrably capable of delivering the NIST upgrade as a result of the recent and comparable data acquisition system upgrade of the HFBS located at sister institution, Forschungzentrum Munich.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about February 3, 2003.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITION; NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE, however, interested parties may express, in writing, their interest and document their bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  Information received before the closing date and time will be reviewed to determine if it is necessary to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Bechtel, BWXT Idaho LLC (BBWI), Management & Operating Contractor of the INEEL, is requesting an EOI from prospective vendors to provide contaminated soil excavation, transportation and landfill operations services.

Approximately 67,000 cubic yards of soil will be excavated and transported.  Landfill operations will be required for several years.  The landfill is the INEEL CERCLA Disposal Facility (ICDF), which is scheduled to be operational on or before July 15, 2003.

III.	PERFORMANCE CRITERIA -
Information is sought to identify prospective vendors with the capabilities to provide the required services.  Scope includes providing equipment, trained personnel, procedures and materials as necessary to excavate, package and transport contaminated soil to the ICDF where it will be off-loaded and disposed of. 

IV.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS -
It is the intent of this EOI to identify candidate vendors who have previous experience in providing similar services.  Prospective Vendors shall provide:

2)	A minimum of one reference who represents a direct client of your firm to validate past similar experience.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is interested in evaluating the design, production, marketing and sale of a number of technology products to determine whether the most commonly stated obstacles to technology accessibility (such as cost, difficulty and/or timing of built-in accessibility features) are supported by research. This study should look at a range of technology products and with respect to each product, examine cost effectiveness; consumer input at the design stage; the development process; customer use and perceptions; idiosyncratic and standardized industry protocols; and current business and industry practices related to universal design, as well as barriers to implementation. This study should examine the philosophical, economic, industry, and technological rationales that currently drive the development of universal design and document examples of successful and nonsuccessful practices. The evaluation will rely primarily on qualitative research strategies, although some quantitative research approaches may be relied upon for economic analysis involving cost data. The estimated contract period is 10 months. NCD will distribute its Universal Design Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on December 18, 2002. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by February 7, 2003. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of December 18, 2002. All requests must reference the RFP number and title.

<DESC>METABOLIC DOMINANCE, BAA 03-02, Addendum 2, DUE 041703, POC: DR. JOSEPH T. BIELITZKI, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4553, Email: baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso. PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in proposals to develop innovative science and technology capable of affording superior physiological qualities to the warfighter.  The vision for the Metabolic Dominance Program is to develop novel strategies that exploit and control the mechanisms of energy production, metabolism, and utilization during short periods of deployment requiring unprecedented levels of physical demand.  The ultimate goal is to enable superior physical and physiological performance by controlling energy metabolism on demand.  An example is continuous peak physical performance and cognitive function for 3 to 5 days, 24 hours per day, without the need for calories.  Continuous exertion over numerous days is currently limited by: 1) the ability to transport and ingest adequate calories and/or effectively access stored calories (e.g., adipose, glycogen); 2) available training time; extended training periods are required to adapt muscle and mitochondria to meet intense physical loads; and 3) the ability of physiological systems to rapidly recover after extended, repeated bouts of physical exertion.  Metabolic Dominance (MD) is a two phase program.  Phase 1 will establish proof-of-concept for four integrated areas of emphasis that together address methods for enhancing soldier performance.  These areas of emphasis focus on: 1) optimizing metabolic performance by developing an understanding of how to control substrate availability and remove metabolic waste products; 2) controlling the thermal environment where energy metabolism occurs; 3) regulating the number and efficiency of cells and organelles necessary for energy production; and 4) identifying the cause of fatigue and, thus, short- or long-term performance degradation.  Phase 2 will provide specific expanded deliverables based on the successful completion of Phase 1.  Proposals responding to this BAA should describe an 18-month Phase 1 effort focused on one or more of the areas of emphasis described below.  Although Phase 2 proposals will be requested at a later date, proposers should clearly indicate what their Phase 2 goals would be and how their 18-month milestones in Phase 1 would lead to the success of those goals.  Phase I proposals should address one or more of the following areas of emphasis: 1) METABOLIC OPTIMIZATION: The warfighter cannot consume adequate calories to sustain metabolic needs over short, intense periods of deployment.  This area seeks concepts for increasing substrate availability to tissues important for strength and endurance, including, but not limited to, proposals investigating: a) methods and mechanisms for rapidly inducing a switch from carbohydrate metabolism to lipolysis as a sustainable source of cellular energy; b) the development of an idealized and customized program for nutritionally preloading the warfighter to facilitate the metabolic transition to lipolysis, c) the development of nutriceuticals or natural products that provide demonstrable benefit for maintaining strength and endurance; d) methods and mechanisms to increase oxygen and metabolite availability to selected tissues, to increase the rate and/or the efficiency of energy metabolism, and/or to provide supplemental high energy phosphates to targeted populations of cells; e) methods and mechanisms to remove or control accumulated metabolic byproducts and/or reactive oxygen species. A key 18-month milestone for the MD Program is demonstration of the ability to selectively regulate the metabolic source of calories on demand, that is, the ability to control the switch from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism, and reverse, for energy production.  Key milestones for the end of Phase 2 include the ability to selectively regulate the metabolic energy source; as well as identification of several methods for increasing nutrient availability to muscle; identification of an idealized program of nutritional preconditioning, including objective evaluations of nutriceuticals, natural products, and traditional nutritional supplements; and methods for controlling hunger during extended periods of lipid metabolism, resulting in enhanced physical performance while utilizing stored calories. 2) THERMOPHYSIOLOGY: Fluctuations in core body temperature limit warfighter performance.  This area seeks concepts, methodologies, and technologies to control core body temperature within an ideal range that would greatly enhance physical performance.  This includes, but is not limited to, proposals investigating: a) the relationship between core body temperature and muscle and mitochondrial efficiency, including enzymology, kinetics, mechanisms, and limiting factors; and b) physical methods (non-invasive) for controlling core body temperature that result in enhanced physical strength and endurance.  A key 18-month milestone is the ability to control core body temperature within an ideal range for energy metabolism.  This ability enhances the effectiveness of physical training and physical performance.  By the end of Phase 2, it is anticipated that a deployable device for controlling core body temperature within 0.5o F will be available for transition to the military services.  In addition to controlling core body temperature, this device will enhance the effectiveness of training and (when combined with other elements of this BAA) result in a 30% increase in strength and duration of activity.  3) MUSCLE AND MITOCHONDRIA: The ideal warfighter is an endurance athlete.  This area seeks methods and mechanisms for rapidly increasing the numbers and efficiency of cardiomyocytes, slow twitch muscle fibers and mitochondria.  This includes, but is not limited to proposals investigating: a) physical methods (non-invasive), small molecule regulators, or other methods that increase mitochondrial numbers and efficiency in muscle and other tissues; b) the control of muscle phenotype and mechanisms involved in the controlled switching of muscle fiber type; c) non-traditional approaches that improve energy utilization without affecting mitochondria or muscle phenotype; d) mechanisms and methods for controlling mitochondrial uncoupling proteins in order to effect heat dissipation and, thus, greater energy production. A key 18-month milestone is the ability to increase mitochondrial numbers and efficiency and alter muscle fiber phenotype, regardless of the degree of physical activity or exercise.  By the end of Phase 2, it is anticipated that both physical methods and small molecule regulators responsible for increasing mitochondrial numbers and encouraging a slow twitch muscle fiber phenotype will be identified and that these increases (when combined with other elements of this BAA) result in a 30% increase in strength and duration of activity.  Achieving a clear understanding of the mechanisms associated with how calories are partitioned into energy or heat and how this distribution can be modified to enhance physical performance is also a Phase 2 goal.  4) RECOVERY AND MAINTENANCE: Continuous physical exertion can lead to fatigue, illness, and injury.  There is significant interest in the early identification of detrimental sequella associated with physical demand.  This includes but is not limited to proposals investigating: a) identification of the cytokine/chemokine profile related to exertion; b) the control of these inflammatory mediators to afford reduced recovery periods or longer periods of exertion; c) negative sequella associated with increased muscle and/or mitochondrial function that could cause harm; d) methods to rapidly identify and minimize problems associated with recovery and maintenance; e) the relationship between immune function and exertion in order to effectively immunize the warfighter prior to deployment and/or optimize the immune response during deployment. A key 18-month milestone is the ability to reduce post-exertion recovery time and to minimize negative consequences of enhanced performance.  At the end of Phase 2, a clear understanding of the relationship between exertion and immune response will be determined, including methods to control deleterious cytokine or chemokine effects, and the role of inflammation in exertion.  The process of controlled energy metabolism and enhanced performance will be reversible without deleterious or irreversible effects.  Adverse effects are to be identified with mechanisms for intervention.  TEAMING: Progress in the Metabolic Dominance Program will depend on the formation of well-managed interdisciplinary efforts that draw on expertise from such areas as metabolic physiology, thermophysiology, nutrition, endocrinology, muscle physiology, mitochondrial physiology, kinesiology, sports medicine, immunology, biochemistry, and vascular biology.  In addition, it is expected that a strong mathematic and/or computer modeling component will be included where necessary.  Members of interdisciplinary teams will be required to work collaboratively and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the Phase 1 objectives.  SUBMISSION OF WHITE PAPERS: We invite white papers (10 pages or less) in response to this announcement.  The white paper should be organized as follows: 1) An Executive Summary; 2) The idea.  Which area(s) of emphasis are you addressing?  3) The approach.  How will you address these areas?  Briefly define the research plan you intend to follow.  What are the research challenges, and how will they be addressed?  What is unique or revolutionary about your approach?  What additional capabilities do you envision will be enabled by your ideas?  How do you plan to demonstrate the success of the research effort within the 18-month period of funding?  Every white paper must describe specific 18-month quantitative milestone(s) that will be achieved in order to demonstrate progress in reaching the ultimate goals of the program; 4) The cost.  What is your cost estimate for resources required for the proposed time line?  This section should include a clear description of both the research and personnel resources  required.  5) The Management Plan.  A brief description of the technical expertise of the principal investigator and the key team members must be provided, along with a management plan describing how different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated to ultimately generate a proof-of-concept to be completed within 18 months.  White papers sent in response to this addendum are due to DARPA no later than 1600 hours EST, February 18, 2003.  Proposers submitting white papers will be notified within 10 business days of that date if a full proposal will be requested.  To facilitate the submission of white papers, website http://www.sainc.com/dso/ has been set up.  For more detailed instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to BAA03-02.  Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18-month scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects. Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged.  Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 18 months, but consideration should be given to possible continuation of the effort into Phase 2.  If proposals include use of Government facilities, offerors will be expected to conclude commercial services arrangements with the providing Government facility.  Offeror teaming with DoD Government activities for R&D efforts other than facility use is discouraged.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 03-02 of December 16, 2002.  To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 EDT APRIL 17, 2003, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.  In addition to the required original and 5 copies of the proposal, proposers are required to submit an electronic copy of the proposal on a ZIP disk.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  Opportunity to respond to this Request For Information (RFI) is open to government agencies, academic institutions, private sector organizations, and other interested parties.  Preparation for the next-generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series is actively proceeding.  NOAA has initiated the GOES-R Series Program to ensure satellite data continuity (with data products and service improvements) for the 2012-2027-time period.	This program includes planning, formulation, risk mitigation, development, procurement, launch and operations for GOES-R Series.  The GOES-R Series will incorporate technically advanced, modern instruments and spacecraft improvements to meet evolving environmental observational requirements for the second and third decades of the 21st Century. The GOES-R series will take advantage of spacecraft, instrument, and ground system advances that result from current industry practices and procedures.  Specific future capabilities are being determined through analysis of requirements, technical viability, and cost and benefits being performed by the GOES-R Team (NOAA and NASA). This analysis process includes the "end-to-end" satellite data acquisition, processing, and dissemination and all elements necessary to develop instruments; acquire and launch spacecraft; and provide for the future ground systems, products, communications, and distribution capability.  Functionally all these elements have been subdivided into two GOES R system segments: (1) Space and Launch Segment and (2) Interface Data Processing Segment.	The GOES R system segments will in turn interface with the following NOAA segments: (1) Command, Control and Communications, (2) Product Generation and Distribution, (3) Data Archive and Access, and (4) User Interface and Asimilation.  The results from these analyses will facilitate the decisions for the following stages in the GOES-R system development. The GOES-R team is seeking feedback on some of the notional concepts that are being considered as part of the requirements and benefits analysis, and technical analysis process.  One of the major changes that may result from this process is the acquisition of multiple satellites at each orbital location (instead of a single satellite East and a single satellite West).  The following attachments include the following: ·	   GOES-R Series system segments and interfaces to NOAA segments · Baseline single and multiple satellite configurations · List of potential sensor payloads ·	   List of communication payloads ·	List of notional configurations being considered ·	  Entire system acquisition schedule ·	  Ground system notional concepts ·	  Detailed spacecraft formulation schedule ·	  Detailed HES formulation schedule Vendors need not provide response in all categories (e.g., spacecraft vendors may limit their responses to spacecraft categories, ground vendors may limit their responses to ground categories, etc.) For your particular area of expertise, it is requested:  (a)   Viability of the notional architecture concepts with current and projected industry and government architectures;  (b)  Pros and cons of existing GOES architectures versus notional multi-sats concepts (e.g., programmatic flexibility, hardware build, non-recurring cost, recurring cost, etc.);  (c)	In the case of multi-sats, pros and cons of one standard spacecraft design with standard interfaces for all payload for all spacecraft versus different spacecraft designs;  (d)	    Suggest any other instrument allocations that may allow for a more optimal spacecraft configuration, in terms of technical performance, deployment and sustainment strategy, acquisition strategy, technology infusion, produceability, schedule flexibility;  (e)	Recommend a deployment strategy that will flatten the year to year spending;  (f)	 Provide comments on the overall schedule;  (g)	Provide comments on the detailed formulation approach and schedule for the spacecraft, instruments, ground systems, etc.;	(h)  Provide comments on alternate data/information distribution to include such ideas as subscription services, commercial, etc.  (i)	Suggest any other improvements to the spacecraft configurations, instrument interfaces, other GOES services, data handling (processing, distribution, usage) and ground systems.  The results of this RFI may be reported outside NASA and NOAA; therefore, any proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  Respondents are urged to describe their approaches in sufficient detail to allow NASA and NOAA to corroborate the ability of the respondent to meet the NOAA requirements.  Sources with information relevant to this request are asked to respond by submitting a response of no more than 25 pages of text (minimum font size: 10) and 10 pages of figures and/or tables.	The response shall clearly contain (a) a description of the particular area(s) the respondent is responding to; (b) a statement describing the applicability of the recommendations to NOAA's space-based mission interests; (c) a general engineering concept of any suggested architectures; (d) comments on the suggested schedule; and (e) a top-level development schedule, if suggesting a different approach to the schedule.  A panel of NASA and NOAA experts will review the information received in response to this RFI.  General information about NOAA's geostationary satellite program can be found at  http://www.osd.noaa.gov/goes  .  THIS IS AN RFI NOT A NOTICE OF IFB, RFP, OR RFO ISSUANCE.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the CBD and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the respondents responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following: name and address of firm or affiliation.  Questions should be directed to: Sandra A. Cauffman, (301)286-7607.  The responses are for information and planning purposes and are not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

?	Draft course evaluation 

Course I, USAF Unique requirements

	The below curriculum content is for estimation purposes and additional information may be included during the formal curriculum development phase.  

1.	Elements of the AFOSH program and responsibilities**
a.	Reference. Air Force Instruction 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, And Health (AFOSH) Program
b.	Purpose. To minimize loss of Air Force resources and to protect Air Force people from occupational deaths, injuries, or illnesses by managing risks.
c.	Scope. AFOSH program guidance applies to all areas, except where otherwise prescribed or specified in Status-of-Forces Agreements or military-unique situations specifically exempted in this instruction. Distinctions will not be made between the requirements for military and civilian personnel.
d.	Regulatory Federal Standards. The Air Force complies with the intent of standards from the Department of Labor (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards, Environmental Protection Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Transportation Standards by directly referencing the applicable standards or incorporating the standards in AFOSH standards, Technical Orders or directives.
e.	Comply with Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) guidance.
f.	Promptly report safety, fire, and health hazards and deficiencies.
g.	Promptly report injuries and illnesses to the supervisor.
h.	Comply with personal protective equipment requirements that apply to the work situation, including its use, inspection, and care.
i.	Give due consideration to personal safety and the safety of fellow workers while doing assigned tasks.
j.	Have the opportunity to:
i.	Take part in the AFOSH program without fear of coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.
ii.	Request inspections of unsafe or unhealthful working conditions or report those conditions to the supervisor, safety manager, fire protection specialist, or BE, including OSHA officials.
iii.	Have access to applicable OSHA and AFOSH standards, installation injury and illness statistics, safety, fire protection, and health program procedures, and their own exposure and medical records.
iv.	Decline to perform an assigned task because of a reasonable belief that the task poses an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm. The person and local management may request an assessment by installation safety, fire protection, or health professionals before proceeding.
v.	Use official on-duty time to take part in AFOSH program activities.
2.	USAF Operational Risk Management (ORM)**
a.	Reference.  Air Force Instruction 90-901, Operational Risk Management
b.	Definition, Purpose, and Scope. Operational risk management is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given situation. ORM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to maximize operational capabilities while limiting all dimensions of risk by applying a simple, systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions both on- and off-duty.
c.	Goals:
i.	Enhance mission effectiveness at all levels, while preserving assets and safeguarding health and welfare.
ii.	Integrate ORM into mission processes; ensuring decisions are based upon assessments of risk integral to the activity and mission.
iii.	Create an Air Force in which every leader, airman, and employee is trained and motivated to manage risk in all their on- and off-duty activities.
iv.	Identify opportunities to increase Air Force war fighting effectiveness on the battlefield and in the operational aerospace environment, helping to ensure decisive victory in any future conflict at the least possible cost.
d.	ORM Principles. Four principles govern all actions associated with the management of risk. These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, during, and after all tasks and operations.
i.	Accept no unnecessary risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All Air Force missions and daily routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk.
ii.	Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the appropriate level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or failure of the mission must be included in the risk decision process.
iii.	Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs. All potential benefits should be compared to all potential costs. The process of weighing risks against opportunities and benefits helps to maximize unit capability. Even high-risk endeavors may be undertaken when there is a well-founded basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs.
iv.	Integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels. To effectively apply risk management, commanders must dedicate time and resources to integrate ORM principles into planning and operational processes. Risk assessments of operations are most mission supportive when they are done as a normal way of conducting a mission, not an add-on process performed by people not otherwise involved.
e.	ORM Fundamentals. The essential concepts of Air Force ORM are outlined below. ORM:
i.	Is a comprehensive system for improving individual and organizational performance in all functional areas and operations.
ii.	Should be tailored to meet the unique mission needs and operational requirements of each organization.
iii.	Provides the process and tools to develop and enhance awareness and understanding of at-risk activities and behavior of personnel both on- and off-duty.
iv.	Application may identify areas where regulatory guidance is overly restrictive or otherwise not consistent with mission requirements. In this event, the risk assessment may be used to support solicitation of appropriate level waiver, variance, or change, but will not in itself constitute authority to violate any directive, policy, standard, or other applicable regulatory guidance.
v.	Is a continuous, systematic decision-making tool consisting of six steps that define the process. The following is a description of the six-step process.
1.	Identify the Hazards. Step one of the process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques in order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazard can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation.
2.	Assess the Risk. The assessment step involves the application of quantitative or qualitative measures to determine the probability and severity of ill effects potentially resulting from exposure to a hazard. 
3.	Analyze Risk Control Measures. Step three involves the evaluation of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three components (probability, severity or exposure) of risk.
 

SST Traffic Safety Module

The SST Traffic Safety Module will consist of two, 1-hour, modules taught to military and civilian personnel when initially assigned to a supervisory position. Background of students vary but generally students are both male and female between the ages of 22 ? 26 years of age.  Military ranks are between SSgt ? Lieutenants while civilians grades are between GS ? 7 through GS ?11.  The class size ranges from 10 ? 30 students.  The goal of the SST Traffic Safety Module is to prevent or reduce frequency and severity of vehicular mishaps involving Air Force personnel and equipment. Overall focus is to provide new supervisors with a working knowledge of their basic safety responsibilities as they pertain to their subordinate?s safety while in a traffic environment.  



Objectives:  Upon completion of the SST Traffic Safety Module students should at a minimum be able to: 

1.	Identify basic principles of USAF Traffic Safety Program and supervisory responsibilities**
2.	Identify elements of Driver Improvement Training and Commander/1st Sergeant/Supervisor roles**
3.	Name basic principles of safe driving 
4.	Identify an employee?s unsafe driving habits, techniques, and behavioral patterns
5.	Identify hazardous driving conditions and appropriate methods for changing employee?s unsafe driving habits, techniques, and behavioral patterns that cause unsafe acts 
6.	Describe appropriate behind-the-wheel responses to employees while driving in hazardous conditions
7.	Identify the effects of inexperience, risk taking and poor judgment on a family and combat capabilities
8.	Identify the effects of peer influence, risky vehicle operations and the ability to capitalize on peer influence to reduce risk

**Subjects that are USAF unique, USAF will provide necessary consultation during development. 

Instructional methodologies for the SST Traffic Safety Module should encompass a facilitated guided discussion (interactive lecture), supplemented by multimedia presentations, role playing, small group activities, video, and class discussion.

Deliverables for the SST Traffic Safety Module will include:

o	Design Plan
o	Class syllabus
o	Facilitator guides/lesson plans
o	Student handouts and/or provide digital or reproducible handouts summarizing the course for supervisory personnel

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N00019-03-P7-ZD055
<RESPDATE>022803
<ARCHDATE>03152003
<CONTACT>Karen Collier, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6984, Fax 301-757-6995, Email collierks@navair.navy.mil - Pam Gray, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 757-6726, Fax 301-757-6902, Email graypk@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, PMA-202C, is requesting information from potential sources which would be helpful in defining the level of effort required to develop a parachute canopy release assembly with improved performance characteristics.   The desired release assembly would include features to allow ease of manual operation while under tension loads, an automatic release capability that would be activated upon immersion in either salt water (threshold) or fresh water (goal), and reduced size to minimize the potential affects of helmet slap during an ejection. Ideally, the automatic release feature would be integral to the canopy release vice requiring a separate automatic release unit.  A Built-In-Test (BIT) capability is also a desired feature and the new release shall be a common device that can be used by both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force.  

Currently, the U.S. Navy utilizes the Parachute Harness Sensing Release Unit that is comprised of a Sea Water Activated Release System (SEAWARS) attached to the canopy release assemblies   the seat mounted parachute riser assemblies.   The Parachute Harness Sensing Release Unit provides a backup automatic mode of separating the parachute from the crewmember within 2 seconds after water immersion (manually activating the canopy release assembly is the primary mode of separating the parachute). The U.S. Air Force utilizes the Universal Water Activated Release System (UWARS) that is also a sea water activated release system designed for in-line attachment to the three different types of canopy release assemblies utilized on the crewmember's restraint harness. These different types of release systems used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force are costly to procure, support, and maintain. 

In an effort to reduce these support costs, the U.S. Government  is exploring potential efforts to evaluate a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or mature technology that will lead to the qualification of a new, common parachute canopy release assembly that will be compatible with the parachute riser assemblies and personnel restraint harnesses of both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force. The purpose of this request is to define the scope of potential efforts and assist in the preparation of detailed requirements. To limit the range of technologies to consider, respondents may assume any potential program  for this effort, including qualification, would be required to be completed within 3 years of initiation. The parachute assemblies and restraint harnesses with which the improved parachute canopy release assembly must be compatible include but are not limited to the following: U.S. Navy: NES-12 Parachute Assembly; NES-16 Parachute Assembly; NES-14 Parachute Assembly; NES-25 Parachute Assembly;  A/P22P-21 Parachute Assembly; A/P28S-28/30/31 Parachute 
Assemblies; A/P28S-24 Parachute Assembly; A/P28S-32(v) Parachute Assembly; PCU-56/P-series Restraint Harnesses; U.S. Air Force:
ACES-II Parachute Assembly; BA-18 Parachute Assembly; BA-21 Parachute Assembly; BA-22 Parachute Assembly; BA-25 Parachute Assembly; BA-27 Parachute Assembly; B-20 Parachute Assembly; C-12 Parachute Assembly; PCU-15/P Restraint Harness; PCU-16/P Restraint Harness; JPATS Parachute Assembly.  The specific information requested to be provided is as follows:

1. Overview of off-the-shelf designs for an improved parachute canopy release assembly that could be adapted to interface with the above parachute assemblies and restraint harnesses, a description of its shape including size and weight, a description of its operation, its activation mechanism, the force required to manually release the assembly for a given riser tension, features that would preclude inadvertent automatic operation, the time required to automatically activate upon water immersion, the maturity level of the design, the testing conducted to verify its operation, extent of testing recommended to qualify proposed design for use by both services and a description of its uses elsewhere, if applicable.   

2. A description of technologies available which could be developed to produce an improved parachute canopy release assembly in the event off-the-shelf designs cannot be adapted. 

3. A description of performance, reliability, maintainability, and compatibility improvements. Specifically, the integral nature of the proposed device as well as the incorporation of a BIT capability should be addressed.  

4. Anticipated modifications to the restraint harnesses/parachute risers and any special support equipment required to accommodate the new release.

5. Risk areas related to technical requirements outlined in this announcement with specific input related to the fresh water operation requirement.

6. Specific recommendations for us to consider for inclusion in any subsequent requirements document.

7. Whether the schedule is reasonable for the effort outlined. 

8. Other innovative suggestions to consider; i.e., automatic ground impact release system.

9. Address whether data rights would be available to the Government.
  
Companies responding to this request should provide responses to Ms. Karen Collier, NAVAIRSYSCOM, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670, or by E-mail, CollierKS@navair.navy.mil.  Please address all technical inquiries to F. Richards Code 461300D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, (760) 939-1454.

Upon request, a copy of the draft performance specification and accompanying questionnaire shall be provided.   Interested potential offerors shall  then be afforded the opportunity to provide comments, suggestions, and recommendations on the draft specification.  Upon request, potential offerors may be afforded the opportunity to further discuss their technical capabilities in one-on-one meetings in February 2003.  The purposes of theses early exchanges with industry are to explore the State-of-the-Art technology to include in APATS applications, to determine the feasibility of new and different at-platform diagnostic strategy, and to interface with i nterested industries for a solid and achievable APATS performance specification.  Information gathered during these early exchanges may be incorporated into the final APATS performance specification and made public.  This announcement is provided for marke t research purposes, and does not obligate the Government to expend any funds or award any contract.   APATS is the fourth generation multipurpose Armys standard automatic test equipment of the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) and is the follow-on to the currently in production and fielded  Maintenance Support Device (MSD) (third generation), the  fielded Soldiers Portable On-System Repair Tool (SPORT) (second generation), and the fielded Contact Test Set (CTS) (first generation).  It will be used throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) at all levels of maintenance to test and diagnose the Army s highly complex communications, other electronic commodity equipment, missiles, aircrafts, and ground vehicles to identify failed line replaceable units (LRUs).  The DOD maintainers will also use the APATS to host Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals /Electronic Technical Manuals and/or specific application software and to upload/download mission data or software.

All questions must be submitted in writing to Clifford Trowbridge or Karen Beyer.

A. INTRODUCTION: 

The Government intends to fund Mentor-Protege agreements by issuing contracts over three separate award cycles. The schedule for Round I is as follows:  Round I Proposals must be received no later than 14 February 2003, 3:00 PM, Central Time, in order to be considered for the initial round of awards. The initial award cycle will follow on or about 15 April 2003. The schedule for Rounds II and III will be posted at a later date.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 15 Oct 03.  For additional Air Force Mentor-Protege Program Information, visit http://www.brooks.af.mil/HSW/BC/MP .

Proposals submitted in response to this announcement shall be submitted through the GSA web based Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Contractors are responsible for registering with ITSS.  (http://it-solutions.gsa.gov)

The Government has reserved limited funding for 10 awards under an AF initiative restricted to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. 

B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDB transition from sub- to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.

Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in this BAA under Section D. The anticipated developmental assistance areas shall include: technology transfer, engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, quality assurance, and any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the development program. A complete description of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).






C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use a competitive Two Tiered approach under this announcement.

TWO-TIERED COMPETITION

The Two-Tiered initiative applies to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. The AF envisions these Protege(s) shall qualify within half the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D. The mentor and protege firm shall agree upon a proposed technology (IAW Section D of this announcement) and outline their approach to Tier One activities in a 10-page White Paper. This White Paper will serve as the proposal for teams wishing to participate in the Two-Tiered approach. During Tier One the HBCU/MI shall evaluate the protegees business needs, conduct market research, and produce a business plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of the agreed upon technology. During Tier One the Business Plan will be completed and a program review conducted. Teams progressing into Tier Two will be down-selected based on program review analyses. The AF will request an expanded White Paper from those teams demonstrating progress and achievement of the stated goals during Tier One. Tier Two will focus on implementing technology transfer and business infrastructure improvements identified during Tier One. The expanded White Paper will serve as the Tier Two Program Plan and must include a detailed schedule, program goals and expected posture at the end of the program.  Award dates under this initiative may differ from the full and open competition. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

	The GSA intends to award contracts with eligible mentors in accordance with the DoD Mentor-Protege Program. The period of performance for the Two-Tiered contract will be six months from date of award for Tier One and 18 months for Tier Two. Offerors shall provide proposed costs and supporting documentation for the 6-month period of performance only.

The Two-Tiered proposals must demonstrate team compatibility and established mutual goals prior to submittal. The Tier One efforts will comprise an in-depth business needs evaluation, market research, and result in a Business Plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of more advanced technology. Tier One activities shall focus on preparing the Protege to accept a specific technology, within the identified thrust areas, to be transferred during tier two.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Round II Port Security Grants Program
<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT

Transportation Security Administration

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is announcing the Port Security Grants Program based on the seaport security provisions contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-117, H.R. Conf. Rpt 107-350) and the FY2002 Supplemental Appropriation (Public Law 107-206). TSA is coordinating with the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in this effort.

Total anticipated funding available for Port Security Grants is $104,093,293. This amount does not include funding for Port Incident Training and Exercises, which will be addressed separate from this program and is not covered by this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  All awards under this program are subject to availability of funds. 


Program Description: 
TSA is planning to award competitive grants to critical national seaports/terminals to support efforts for Port Security in the areas of 1) Security Assessments and Mitigation Strategies; 2) Enhanced Facility and Operational Security (including Proof-of-Concept). Grants shall be awarded based on the criteria established for each category. 

Grant applications will be accepted for two categories:

1. Security Assessments and Mitigation Strategies (Category I) ? Award based on proposed security assessments that ascertain vulnerabilities of physical or operational security of a port, multiple terminals, terminal, or vessel (commuter or ferry service) and identify mitigation strategies. 

2. Enhanced Facility and Operational Security (Category II) ? Including but not limited to facility/terminal/vessel (commuter or ferry service) access control, physical security, cargo security and passenger security. Consideration will also be given to proof-of-concept projects which can demonstrate how security would be improved/enhanced by their implementation.


Eligibility Requirements: Critical National Seaports/Terminals. To be considered a critical national seaport/terminal, one or more of the following attributes must be met:
&#61623; One of the 14 designated ?strategic ports?, as designated by a Maritime Administration port planning order.
&#61623; Controlled Port ? Ports which have access controls for vessels from certain countries due to national security issues. Controlled ports are: New London/Groton, CT; Portsmouth, NH (including Kittery, Maine and Dover, New Hampshire on the Piscataqua River); Hampton Roads, VA (including Norfolk, Newport News, Jamestown, Yorktown, and Portsmouth, VA); Charleston, SC; Kings Bay, GA; Port Canaveral, FL; Panama City, FL; Pensacola, FL; Port St. Joe, FL; Port Hueneme, CA; San Diego, CA; and Honolulu, HI.
&#61623; A nationally important economic port or terminal responsible for a large volume of cargo movement or movement of products that are vital to U.S. economic interests as required for national security.
&#61623; Ports, terminals, commuter vessels or ferry service vessels responsible for movement of a high number of passengers.
&#61623; Ports or terminals responsible for the movement of hazardous cargo.

Eligible Parties
&#61623; Public and private ports, terminals or vessels (commuter or ferry service) and state/local government entities
&#61623; Private entities will be considered when security interests related to the location and/or operation affects the greater public interest
&#61623; Consultants may prepare applications for an otherwise eligible party; however, only the eligible party can actually submit the application and be considered for grant award
&#61623; Consortiums composed of local stakeholder groups (i.e. river groups, ports and terminal associations)
&#61623; All grant applications and supporting documentation must be submitted electronically via the Website at www.portsecuritygrants.dottsa.net  Applications and supporting documentation submitted via any other avenue, including but not limited to hardcopy, electronic/e-mail, and facsimile, will not be accepted

Prerequisites
&#61623; For Category II 
&#61623; Applicants must have completed a security assessment and tie the security enhancements to their assessment in order to submit a grant application in this category. Security assessments must be available for review upon the request of the evaluators.  


To establish the criticality under Eligibility Requirements, applicants must provide data/statistics that relate to their specific port project (for port applications), terminal project (for terminal applications), waterways, or commuter vessel or ferry service vessel projects. Terminals and vessels cannot rely on aggregated port statistics to meet eligibility criteria. Evaluators intend to use available applicable government and industry data to assess the reasonableness of cargo type and volume (tonnage and value), hazardous materials data or number of passengers contained in the grant application.

Ineligible Projects/Proposals
The following projects are considered ineligible for award consideration:
&#61623; Projects already receiving funding on a national level, such as transportation worker credentialing, vessel traffic system (VTS), automatic identification system (AIS) and the development of risk/vulnerability assessment models 
&#61623; Projects/items involving funding requirements for personnel, maintenance, and operating expenses
&#61623; Projects involving bridge infrastructure, roads, and nuclear power plants;
&#61623; Projects that do not involve a compelling security benefit (primarily economic or safety vs security)

Selection Preference Considerations
In general, preference will be given to: 
&#61623; Projects that impact a port system vice a single terminal or facility;
&#61623; New installation vs replacing or enhancing existing infrastructure (fences, etc);
&#61623; Projects that enhance intermodal transportation security within the footprint of the port, including pipelines within the terminal
&#61623; Projects that include cost-sharing 
&#61623; Eligible applicants that have made prior security enhancements/investments (eligible applicants must document cost and enhancements completed)
