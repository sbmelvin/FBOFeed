<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to support the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency (DPPA) through its Emergency Preparedness Strengthening Program (EPSP). The overall goal of EPSP is to improve the DPPA’s capacity to manage through shocks. Specifically, one of the systemic changes it hopes to bring about is to enable DPPA and its partners to better understand livelihoods and coping strategies of populations vulnerable to food insecurity, and so be better equipped to anticipate shocks that risk lives and livelihoods through improved early warning.  The Ethiopian Early Warning System (EWS) has several components including:

a)	regular monitoring which mainly focuses on information gathering that mainly includes indicators such as climatic data, crop production, markets and prices, livestock production, other sources of income such as wage labor, petty trade, petty commodity production, remittances, wild fruit collection etc, human health, malnutrition, coping mechanisms, food stress or famine indicators;
b)	disaster area assessments, mainly focusing on rapid-onset disasters;
c)	rapid health and nutrition assessments;
d)	intermittent nutritional surveillance; and 
e)	annual multi-agency emergency need assessments.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The objective of the EMIL program is to develop new MWIR (defined here to be wavelengths between 3.8 and 4.8 ìm) laser concepts with fundamentally superior efficiencies and to demonstrate MWIR lasers which approach these efficiencies.  Specific program goals include:

Wallplug efficiency exceeding 50 percent;

CW output power exceeding 1 W;

Operation at 300K ambient temperature (TE cooled);

Beam quality better than two times diffraction limit in both directions; and

Compact physical size.

Spectral tunability across the band and narrow linewidths are desirable laser qualities but are secondary to the above program goals.  

DARPA may consider as eligible compelling proposals with highly innovative technical approaches that fall short of the above program goals. Proposers offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data, simulations, and calculations, leading to estimates of practical and fundamental performance limits in operational parameters of the envisioned EMIL source.

The main technology development part of the EMIL program will be conducted in two Phases, each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics.  Offerors also have the option to propose a system-scale demonstration as a third Phase. The period of performance for each of these Phases and the milestone schedule will be proposed by offerors within their technical proposals and will be factors considered as part of the source selection process (see below).  In general, a shorter phase is preferable, but each Phase should clearly be adequate in duration to meet its objectives with reasonable risks and costs.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.  


DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  

I.	Modeling and Design of Efficient MWIR Lasers;
II.	Fabrication of Advanced Structures for Efficient MWIR  Lasers;
III.	Thermal Management of Efficient MWIR Lasers;
IV.	Power Scaling of Highly Efficient MWIR Lasers.


Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-20 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.



PROGRAM SCOPE

The Efficient Mid-wave Infrared Laser (EMIL) program will consist of a Phase I (duration of Phase I should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), followed by a Phase II and Phase III (duration of Phase II and Phase III should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Offerors wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POCs for this effort are Mark Rosker and Henryk Temkin, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA06-20@darpa.mil. 

PROPOSER’S QUESTIONS

A “Proposer’s Questions,” website will be posted for BAA 06-14 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA06-20@darpa.mil.  


GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-20, Efficient Mid-wave Infrared Lasers (EMIL), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, FedGrants website: http://www.fedgrants.gov/,World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

 In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and nine (9) copies of the proposal abstract and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the abstract [in PDF, or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM] should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-20, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy     of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-20) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Wednesday, April 12, 2006.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.

Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and nine (9) copies of the full proposal and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-20, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-20) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Wednesday, June 21, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-20, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in deep ultraviolet avalanche photodetectors.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Satellite and Information Service (NESDIS) intends to negotiate with Qwest Government Services, Inc., Denver, CO on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 US c. 51(c)(1), only one responsible source. NESDIS has a requirement to install new circuits and relocate existing circuits in support of its move to a new facility, designated as the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF). NESDIS is seeking diverse routing for mission critical communication circuits between the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) located at 35663 Chincoteague Road, Wallops, Virginia  23337 and the NSOF located at 4231 Suitland Road, Suitland, Maryland  20746.  The primary communications path from WCDAS (NPA-NXX 757-824) to Suitland (NPA-NXX 301-817) is currently to the south through the local Verizon Central Office in Temperanceville, Virginia and then north using terrestrial services. This requirement is for four (4)T-1 circuits, with the possible expansion to a DS-3 circuit, to  connect WCDAS to NSOF via diverse routing. The diverse routing path will be north from WCDAS through Maryland without connection in Temperanceville. The communication path will not connect to the southern route in Virginia, which currently provides services to the existing mission critical circuits.  Terrestrial services are desired; however, other links may be provided in areas where methods such as microwave service facilities must be used to provide a completely diverse route. NESDIS will provide CSU/DSU equipment at the point of demarcation. The Contractor will provide all other equipment and services, including, hardware and maintenance. Response time for circuit failures which impact the ability of NESDIS to operate the circuits shall not exceed four (4) hours. The circuits connecting to the NSOF will have local access through the Suitland Verizon Central Office. Circuits will be placed on the new NSOF OC-48 SONET Ring.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 5-days after publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Sally Huber, Contract Specialist. Note 22 applies

After the removal of the three other kits, the kit that was on the bottom shall retain its original shape. 3.2 Impact Resistance: When fully loaded, closed, latched and placed in its normal resting position in a room temperature environment, the kit shall withstand impacts from dropped objects. As a minimum, it shall withstand an impact from a steel bar weighing at least three pounds, with a cross section no larger than 3/16 by 1 inch and edge radii no larger than 1/16 inch. This bar shall have been dropped in free fall from a height of 8 feet and shall have landed narrow end down on the lid of the kit. The kit shall absorb the blow (bar impact) without suffering permanent deformation to its general overall configuration. The impact shall not cause penetration of the lid by the steel bar. 3.3 Rain Resistance: When closed and fastened, the kit shall shed rainwater to prevent any water from being accumulated inside the carry case. 3.4 Rough Handling Resistance: A fully loaded kit with tools shall withstand a drop test from a height of 60 inches onto a concrete floor. The kit shall also withstand being rolled over on the floor, 360 degrees, four times, once over each lower edge of the case (when set in the upright position), without displacement of any of the retained tools and without sustaining any deformation or damage to the kit.  The rough handling requirement shall be supplemented by the requirement for warranty as stated in the contract. 3.5 Finish:  The exterior finish of the carrying case shall be corrosion resistant. The exterior shall have no sharp edges or protrusions. 3.6 Color:  The color of the carrying case shall be subdued and either olive drab or black. 3.7 Size:  The overall dimensions of the carrying cases for each of the tool kits will not exceed 48” in length by 24” in width by 22” in height.  Any case that is smaller than the above dimensions, and can meet the rest of this SOW, will be given better evaluation scores.  3.8 Markings:  The enclosure shall have an aluminum name plate with black marking. permanently affixed to the outside of the carrying case.  The following information will be included on the name plate: the government contract number, cage code of the manufacture, kit nomenclature and NSN if available.   The government representative shall be informed of any kit content substitution as soon as the potential of replacement obsolescence is identified or anticipated. 3.9 Packing Instructions: Each kit should be packed the same and in an orderly fashion. 4.0 Verifications: 4.1 Quality Assurance: Product verification shall be performed in accordance with the following requirements: 4.2 Responsibility for Verification: Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the contractor is responsible for the performance of all verification requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract, the contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the verification requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the verifications set forth in the specifications where such verifications are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance: All delivered items must meet all requirements of this contract. The absence of any verification requirements shall not relieve the contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products submitted to the government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract. 4.4 Product Examination: Visually and manually examine each of three sample kits per lot to determine conformance with the requirements of 3.1 through 3.10.  Visual examination shall include verification of completeness of manufacture and assembly, proper cleaning, and freedom from identified defects. Dimensional examination includes measuring dimensions as specified and weighing the unit. Manual examinations shall include the operation of movable parts by hand to assure proper functioning. Failure of any sample unit to pass any examination shall result in the inspection of each unit of that lot for the failure. Units that fail any examination shall not be offered to the government for acceptance. 4.5 Performance Verification: The performance verification procedures specified in paragraphs 4.1 through 4.10, shall be performed using four units randomly selected from the first month’s delivery quantity. Failure of any of the four units to pass any of these verification procedures shall result in actions necessary to correct the failure, followed by re-performance of all verifications. Only units having incorporated the necessary corrections previously found to be unacceptable during verification assessment shall be offered to the government for acceptance. Necessary corrective actions shall not be construed as an excusable reason for extending delivery dates or restructuring the contract delivery schedule. 4.6 Stack Ability Verification: Four fully loaded kits shall be stacked on top of each other, four high, to verify stack ability. Failure to stack securely, wobbling, or rocking shall constitute failure of this requirement. A fully loaded kit shall be defined as having all the tools annotated in paragraph 1.0 contained inside the carry case. The carrying case, when closed, latched and in its normal storage position shall protect the contents from damage. The case shall withstand, without damage or permanent deformation to itself, a load consisting of three other identical fully loaded tool kits stacked on top of the kit under stackability test for hours. After the removal of the three other kits, the kit that was on the bottom shall retain its original shape. 4.7 Crush Resistance Verification: The four fully loaded chests shall be stacked one upon the other for not less than one hour. Any damage to the kits, permanent deformation, of failure to retain shape shall constitute failure of the requirement  (reference paragraph 3.1). 4.8 Impact Resistance Verification: A fully loaded kit shall be inspected for resistance to damage from impacts with sharp falling objects. A steel bar weighing not less than three pounds, with a cross section no larger than 3/16 by 1 inch and with an edge radii no larger than 1/16 inch shall be dropped in free fall from a height of not less than eight feet. The bar shall land narrow end down on the chest. Any damage or effect beyond minor denting of the exterior shall constitute failure of this requirement (reference paragraph  3.2). 4.9 Rain Resistance Verification: Close and fasten one of the kits without the tool load in it.  Place the kit in a shower device for five minutes with water flowing directly at the kit from above and from all four sides at a 45 degree angle, in a sprinkle pattern at a rate not less than one gallon per minute, per nozzle, totaling twenty five gallons. At the end of the period turn off the water and towel dry the exterior of the kit. Open the kit and inspect the inside for the accumulation of water. The accumulation of water inside shall constitute failure of this requirement (reference paragraph 3.3). 4.10 Rough Handling Verification: Fully load a kit, close and fasten. Drop the kit from a height of 60 inches onto a hard floor surface. Inspect the case for cracks, breaks, dents or other damage that renders it less usable, including less transportable. Roll the case over on the floor, 360 degrees, so that the case becomes completely inverted, and do so four times, in the four different directions, going over each of the four lower edges. Set the case upright. Open the case. Inspect the tools to assure that all tools are still in their proper storage position. Failure of the case to withstand being dropped without sustaining damage as described above, or failure of the tool organizing liner (foam or pockets) to retain the tools in position shall constitute failure of this requirement (reference paragraph 3.4). 5. Changes to Materials, Processes, or Configuration: The government representative shall be informed of any changes to the materials, processes, or configuration of any characteristic of the units. The government representative shall determine if the reported changes to materials, processes, or configuration shall require the verifications of paragraph 4.1 to 4.10 be repeated. 6. Conformance of Subsequent Production Quality: All products offered for acceptance throughout the life of the contract shall conform to all of the requirements of the contract. The Government reserves the right to re-verify conformance with requirements, at its own facility and at its own expense, at any time during the life of the contact and return to the contractor for warranty replacement such product that does not conform to the specified requirements.

Initial offers should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Offerors are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Id!  entification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA’s homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.m!  il/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively .

<DESC>The Underwater Shock Analysis Branch, Code 661, of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has been tasked to develop and construct a low cost test device for use as a screening device for equipment that will be installed on isolated rafts. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Spectrum Research Corporation . This is a follow-on effort to Spectrum Research Corporation who developed the concept and constructed the prototype test device under previous Government contracts. This test device utilizes highly advanced unique rotary direct-shear mode Magnetorheological (MR) devices, invented by Spectrum, to drive the system in a controlled manner.  Spectrum Research Corporation will provide the engineering services necessary to integrate the closed loop feedback controls to complete, demonstrate/characterize, and deliver the fully operational system.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 2/10/2006.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division,  Panama City, Florida (NSWCDDPC), intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price contract to AP Labs, Inc. of San Diego, CA for seven (7) LCAC CAMS shipsets (14 CAMS Processor Units) including options for an additional thirteen (13) CAMS shipsets over two years.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  AP Labs, Inc. was the original sole developer of the LCAC CAMS selected by the LCAC prime contractor.  As the sole developer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM), AP Labs, Inc. is the only source with the proprietary hardware, proprietary software that can provide the CAMS without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the LCAC SLEP program requirements. This is in fact a follow-on contract to contract N61331-04-C-0003 for the continued production of  highly !  specialized equipment.

<DESC>The National Institutes of health (NIH), The Fogarty International Center (FIC) intends to procure on a sole source basis with Wendy Prudhomme O’Meara to engage in a series of studies to develop modeling as a tool to support planning and decision-making in international public health applications.  The phase of the work proposed focuses on 1) evaluating the effects of new strategies of anti-malaria drug treatment and 2) developing analytic approaches that account for uncertainties and adverse circumstances in determining trial endpoints for prospective anti-malaria vaccines.  These efforts are to improve assessment and increase confidence in the outcomes of anti-malaria intervention trials.  The contracted products in the first project are a standard protocol for measuring the spread of drug resistance in a community-wide intervention program and a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of drug-based intervention which can be used as a tool by malaria control programs.  The second project will systematically, quantitatively address the problems associated with choosing case definitions for malaria drug and vaccine clinical trials with special emphasis on inaccurate parasite detection and propose solutions to reduce error and improve comparability across clinical trials and between vaccines. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 22 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Northrop Grumman Corp. and Ball Aerospace Corp. for the further development of the New Worlds Imager concept. This concept was conceived in a study led by Prof. Webster Cash of the University of Colorado under the sponsorship of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (www.niac.usra.edu). The NIAC’s charter is to stimulate the development of a broad range of advanced concepts and unique, innovative ideas in aeronautics and space.  These concepts are solicited via a Call for Proposals, and those deemed meritorious are selected through a highly competitive, peer-reviewed process.  The two companies named above were, and continue to be, co-investigators in the competitively selected NIAC study under which the initial New Worlds Imager concept was formulated.   The New Worlds Imager concept is a deep-space astronomical mission involving the deployment of large structures in space.  Specifically, the mission uses a space telescope and a large occulting mask external to the telescope to make coronagraphic observations in search of planets around nearby stars. It involves precision star tracking and requires an understanding of diffraction and scattering theory, as well as orbital analysis and flight dynamics to control the spacecraft over a wide range in velocity   If this concept is selected for further study, the proposed contract would have a 12-month period of performance. Under this contract, NGC and Ball would conduct a Phase-A study of a mission based on the New Worlds Imager concept. This study will conform to the guidelines given in NPR 7120.5B (NASA Program and Project Management Processes and Requirements).   Because Northrop Grumman and Ball are integral members of the team that formulated the initial concept, they are the only sources capable of further developing this unique concept as part of a Phase-A mission study. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.   However, organizations who believe they can provide these services should fully identify their interest and qualifications/capabilities by the response date of this synopsis to point of contact identified below. Such qualifications/ capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Severe Storms Laboratory intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contract for engineering support and other technical activities necessary to research, investigate, design, develop, integrate, test, evaluate, and document hardware and system software modification and enhancements for the Phased Array Radar (PAR) within the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT).    The contract is anticipated to be awarded for a total period of five years.  

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:  The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) is one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) internationally known research laboratories, leading the way in investigations of all aspects of severe weather.  The NSSL is part of the Office of Atmospheric and Oceanic Research (OAR) within the Department of Commerce (DOC). Headquartered in Norman, Oklahoma, the people of NSSL, in partnership with the National Weather Service (NWS), are dedicated to improving severe weather warnings and forecasts in order to save lives and reduce property damage.  The mission of NSSL is to enhance the NOAA’s capabilities to provide accurate and timely forecasts and warnings of hazardous weather events (e.g., blizzards, ice storms, flash floods, tornadoes, lightning, etc.).  The NSSL accomplishes this mission, in partnership with the National Weather Service (NWS), through a balanced program of research to advance the understanding of weather processes, research to improve forecasting and warning techniques, development of operational applications, and transfer of understanding, techniques, and applications to the NWS and other public and private sector agencies.  The services required under this contract support NOAA’s Strategic Goal to advance short-term warning and forecast services under the NOAA Weather and Water budget process.  

SPECIFIC: There are four task order themes to be performed under this contract effort.  They are: 	Theme 1. General PAR Engineering Consulting and Support; Theme 2. Polarizing the PAR; Theme 3. Improving PAR Efficiency; Theme 4. PAR Special Projects.  A full description of the task themes follows: (1)  General PAR Engineering Consulting and Support - General PAR engineering consulting and support tasks involve activities to determine hardware or software problem sources (system bugs), support problems involving engineering functions, support problem solving and system integration issues with other NOAA agencies, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Transportation (DOT), or other organizations such as universities, and general contract management and administration activities. (2)  Polarizing the PAR - Tasks needed to polarize the PAR include, but are not limited to, designing and building the antenna subarray, retrofitting and integrating the subarray to the existing system, and specifying parts for the subarray. (3)  Improving PAR Efficiency  - Tasks associated with improving the PAR efficiency include, but are not limited to, designing and building Active Array modules (vs. Passive Array modules), redesigning and building more heat efficient transmit/receive (TR) modules, designing and fabricating less expensive TR modules, and testing new materials that might achieve more efficient and less expensive TR modules (e.g., Gallium Nitrate). (4)  PAR Special Projects - Task associated with Special Projects for the PAR development include, but are not limited to, short-term exploratory studies of proposed research through software and hardware development, testing, prototype development, integration, and technology transfer to operational groups such as the National Weather Service.  An example of a Special Project might be activities surrounding coordination of NSSL’s weather related PAR development efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) aircraft tracking development efforts.  NSSL is involved in several funding initiatives that could lead to an increase in funding for such activities not predictable at this time.  There are a total of four (4) support functions for each of the four basic task order themes.  The services required for any particular task order may include any or all of the four basic functions for each of the four basic task order themes.  The support functions are: (a) System Engineering and Development; (b) System Test and Evaluation Support; (c) System Integration; and (d) Program/Project Management Support.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Award of a contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government from a technical risk and price perspective.  Price will be a factor in the award decision, although award may not necessarily be made to the offeror submitting the lowest price.  The technical factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.  Factor A- Technical Approach (Maximum points 44); Factor B – Past Performance (Maximum points 26);  Factor C –Management Approach (Maximum points 15); and  Factor D – Key Personnel  (Maximum points 15).  

The estimated issuance date of  RFP RA133R-06-RP-0054 is approximately 15 days after the posting of this notice.   This acquisition is a total small business set-aside and is expected to be awarded under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  541710/500 employees.  See Notes 1 and 26.

<DESC>The FBI is considering the release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Development and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) work for the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) in 2006.  In order to ensure that the needs of the government are fully addressed and to involve industry in advance of the RFP, the FBI CODIS Unit is initiating this Request for Comments (RFC).  The proposed contract will consist of two Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):  CLIN 0001 - CODIS Development and CLIN 0002 - an optional O&M CLIN.  Each CLIN will include sub-CLINS as follows:  Sub-CLIN 0001-01 - Development; Sub-CLIN 0001-02 - Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Equipment and Software; Sub-CLIN 0001-03 - Engineering Services and Support; Sub-CLIN 0002-01 - O&M; Sub-CLIN 0002-02 - Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Equipment and Software; and Sub-CLIN 0002-03 - Engineering Services and Support.  All CLINs will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), with the exception of Sub-CLIN 0001-01, Development, which will be Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF).  By way of background, the CODIS supports the FBI mission against violent crime, terrorism, and foreign intelligence threats by enabling the identification and prosecution of responsible parties through their DNA.  CODIS is an automated DNA information processing and telecommunications system that supports three levels of CODIS use referred to as the National DNA Index System (NDIS), State DNA Index System (SDIS), and Local DNA Index System (LDIS).  The CODIS program enables federal, state, and local forensic laboratories to establish DNA databases and to exchange and compare DNA profiles electronically, thereby identifying suspects by matching DNA from crime scenes to convicted offenders, linking violent crimes to each other and exonerating the innocent.  The CODIS has been operational since mid-1990 with a user base of over 200 domestic and international laboratories.  Interested parties are asked to request a copy of the RFC.  Non-disclosure agreements must be signed and returned via facsimile by all interested parties prior to receiving the RFC, which will be issued via e-mail.  The FBI requests that all comments and questions be submitted by 12 noon EST, March 10, 2006.  All requests and submissions are to be made to Susan J. Smith, FBI Contracting Officer, via e-mail at susmith@leo.gov.  Answers to all questions received regarding the RFC will be made available to all parties who request a copy of the RFC.  If you have any questions regarding this RFC, please e-mail Mrs. Smith.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541720   The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Research Triangle Park, NC, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Jack R. Edwards of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at North Carolina State University to develop continuum models for the transport of particulate of a specified size class. These models will solve equations for mass and momentum conservation of a particulate phase,influenced by forces that affect the motion of particles. These include hydrodynamic drag, buoyancy, Saffmann lift forces, and  surface adhesion forces. The particulate transport routines will either be integrated in tandem with the main flow equations or be  solved in a stand-along manner ,subject to an inputted time-depercent velocity field. The nature of this acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique  capability of a statistical modeling programmer familiar with two phase flow dynamics using an immersed boundary method.  This unique capability is essential for contract performance because the contractor must be intimately familiar with the development of this model and have prior experience to  understand the experimental data that is being used to create and validate this model.  This unique capability is critical because it is required on the current model to meet the tasks in the statement of work. Dr. Edwards previously provided computational simulation and modeling support  for experimental activities to understand the processes leading to particulate dispersal and re?suspension in confined Environments. Now, EPA has identified the need to complete the additional tasks mentioned based on the results of the previous work. Specifically, Dr. Edwaids wIll be required to:  (1) development of more accurate model for particulate adhesion forces, (2) development of a carpet deformation / rebound model, (3) inclusion of thermal effects, and (4) addition of overset grid capability.   This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates Dr. Edwards  is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project. Since these tasks are a natural progression from previous work completed, it would take considerable time for a new contractor to become familiar with the work already completed. The  work is highly complex and complicated and any other contractor would require extensive and costly training to have the ability to deliver the services here required. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential  of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before March 11, 2006 5:00PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government. Information received will be considered solely for the puroose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis .This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The applicable NAICS code is 541720.  Interested parties should submit their technical documentation to Ellen Bailey, as follows: via regular mail: U.S. EPA, Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, or via Express Mail/Hand Carry: U.S. EPA, 4411 Montgomery Road, Sijite 300,  Norwood, OH 45212.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Radu Ion, Technical Director, SC Termoelectrica SA, 103 Lacul Tei Blvd., Bucharest, 020371, Romania, Phone:  40-21-303-7503, Fax:  40-21-303-7503.  Emissions Monitoring and Plant Performance Improvement Feasibility Study Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for to determine the preferred method for upgrading the controls and monitoring systems at 21 of SC Termoelectrica SA’s largest power plants.  

SC Termoelectrica SA is the largest power generation enterprise in Romania. It is a 100% state-owned joint stock company. The firm was founded in 2000, when the former vertically integrated National Electricity Company was split into four independent entities.  This was part of a phased program to transfer ownership of the major components of the Romanian power sector from state control to private ownership.  Termoelectrica currently owns and operates six power plants with a total capacity of 3705 MW.  (Termoelectrica is also the sole shareholder of the independently managed Electorcentrale Bucuresti, the principal district heating supplier in Bucharest and operator of seven additional generating plants with a combined capacity of 2010 MW.)

The six power plants that are directly controlled by Termoelectrica are located at sites around the country at distances varying from 60 to 200 miles away from Bucharest. The generating units at these plants vary from 60 to 300 MW in size. The oldest was commissioned in 1969 and the newest unit in 1984. Termoelectrica has been gradually upgrading and modernizing their power plants, replacing a legacy of aging and obsolete controls and monitoring equipment with modern computer-based distributed controls systems. The approaching deadline for the country’s accession into the European Union (EU) has created a situation that now requires Termoelectrica to act quickly in making major improvements in their stack emissions monitoring equipment and plant performance supervisory systems.  

As a condition of its admission to the EU, Romania has agreed to limit the levels of pollutants from its major industrial facilities to the standards that have been stipulated for all EU member countries. The EU has established a broad list of limits for air, water and other pollutants that result from power generation (e.g. sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon dioxide (CO2)), along with strict requirements for measuring and reporting the levels of pollutants originating at each significant source. According to this directive, the operators of all large combustion plants have the obligation to continuously monitor emissions and report the levels to regulators in Bucharest and Brussels.  

A second condition of Romania’s agreement to join the EU involves the commitment to open the country’s electricity market to competition from power producers in all EU member states. This means that in 2007 Termoelectrica will have to compete with other European producers in the Romanian power market. It also means that to survive as a viable power producer, it must prepare to sell into the spot markets in the European grid, where prices vary on a daily basis. This will require Termoelectrica to monitor the thermal efficiency of its plants and other variables that affect the cost of power production on a real-time basis. This capability will be needed for them to effectively compete in the daily auction process that sets electricity pricing and power plant dispatching throughout the EU.  

Termoelectrica lacks the level of control and monitoring technology needed to meet these requirements.  Therefore, to remedy these deficiencies, Termoelectrica is planning to acquire advanced continuous emissions monitoring systems, and plant performance and analysis systems in all of their plants. They are also planning to install a wide-area communications network that will link all of the plants with the headquarters office. This will enable plant dispatchers and financial managers to continuously observe and evaluate critical technical and economic information from all of the plants, and to make coordinated adjustments in day to day plant operations to minimize their power production costs. The proposed feasibility study would analyze and determine the best plan to upgrade and implement these new systems.  The study would evaluate an array of specialized subsystems, incorporating both equipment and software that will be needed to implement the project.  

The objective of this Feasibility Study is to analyze and determine the best plan/methodology to upgrade the emissions monitoring and control systems at 21 of SC Termoelectrica SA’s largest power plants in Romania.  This will be done through:  data gathering, developing baseline data for the units, developing optimization methodology, assessing the compatibility of existing European Union standards and environmental impact, assessing developmental impact, defining the project scope packages, determining the least cost option, developing an implementation plan, developing a detailed cost estimate, and preparing performance-based engineer, and procure and construct (EPC) bidding documents.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $271,054 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, March 28, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Navy anticipates the award to be a firm fixed price contract. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

If you feel that your company can meet these qualifications, please mail your capability statement to:  FAA, knowledge of the work performed by SC-159, WG-4 from both a historical perspective and the status of the LAAS MASPS, MOPS, and ICD is mandatory. Also, a complete understanding of the recent changes to the MOPS and ICD and the subsequent affect to the LGF Specification, FAA-E-2937A, is critical. 2. The ability to understand and articulate the flow-down of requirements from the LAAS MASPS to the LGF specification, RTCA MOPS, and ICD is critical.  This includes how allocations are made between the H0 and H1 Hypothesis stated in the MASPS and the allocation to ranging source faults, as found in the FAA-E-2937A.     3. The ability to relate MASPS, MOPS, ICD and LGF specification to ICAO Annex 10 SARPs is critical. 4. The ability to perform trade-off analysis in integrity and continuity requirements is critical. 5.

<ARCHDATE>03162006
<CONTACT>Patty Matyskiela, Contract Specialist, Phone xxx-xxx-xxxx, Fax xxx-xxx-xxxx, Email Patricia.Matyskiela@darpa.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to delete the requirement for U.S. Citizen only participants in the planned Proposer's Day Conference for the Super Resolution Vision System Program. Accordingly, the original announcement has been revised as follows:

PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Conference in support of the BAA 06-23, Super Resolution Vision System (SRVS) program on March 9, 2006 at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd., Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201 from 8:00am to 7:00pm.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the SRVS program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

The forthcoming SRVS BAA will encourage proposals to include (but are not limited to) specific areas of technology.  DARPA is interested in proposals to design, build, and field a prototype man-portable optical system that will credibly extend the range for target recognition and identification over existing systems.  The key technical innovation is to exploit an atmospheric turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomenon through collection of a stream of high-speed images to generate better-than diffraction limited images.  DARPA is interested in proposals that utilize state-of-the-art optical and computational technologies to exploit this turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomenon, which will facilitate new operational and tactical opportunities for land forces.  Proposals must culminate in a field demonstration of a prototype system scaled to in-service system size, weight and power.

The BAA will request proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

Potential proposers are encouraged to use the Proposers' Day to discuss their organization's capabilities and explore teaming arrangements with other conference attendees. 

REGISTRATION INFORMATION

Participants must register NLT March 3, 2006, at the following website:  https://www.schafertmd.com/srvs2006/.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to 100 registrants.  DARPA reserves the option to limit the number of attendees per organization to enable participation by as many organizations as possible.  The Proposers’ Day is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to this BAA.  

The Proposers’ Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 “Foreign National Visit Request”.  The DARPA Form 60 is available to download from the registration website.  The completed DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to: Tom Fitzgerald, Schafer Corporation, fax 703-516-6031, phone 703-516-6061, no later than March 3, 2006.  

After the main conference activities, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with DARPA PM Jennifer Ricklin.  Please contact Erik L. Smith (esmith@schafertmd.com), 703 516-6728, to schedule an individual session.
  
In order to facilitate the teaming that is encouraged for proposal development, attendees are granted the opportunity to present an overview of their organizations, and discuss their technology expertise, via presentation at the conference.  Presentations may contain 2-4 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers’ Day Conference should contact Erik L. Smith 703-516-6728 as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers’ Day Conference.  

All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive, but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the SRVS Proposers’ Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by March 1, 2006.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPOSERS’ DAY ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT INSTEAD DIRECT ALL INQUIRIES AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN.

<SOLNBR>263-2006-P-(GI)-0004
<RESPDATE>010606
<CONTACT>Terita Stevenson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-3727, Fax 301-480-1203, Email stevenst@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Research Services (ORS), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of contractors to provide services for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management Program (IPMP).     This requirement is for the development of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management Program (IPMP) and the implementation of integrated pest management services that will meet AAALAC accreditation requirements.  The IPMP must provide service to all NIH animal facilities.  Technical expertise is an essential component of the IPMP, and is required to provide routine and emergency consultation with NIH personnel, to resolve pest management problems, and direct day-to-day pest management operations.  The IPMP shall be proactive in design and performance.  This is to minimize the need for a "crisis response" to pest outbreaks, and to maximize cooperation and program effectiveness.  The IPMP is an integral part of the safety programs at the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services.  The IPMP must reflect an emphasis on the reduction and long term control of pests without jeopardizing research or compromising the health and safety of the patients, NIH personnel, or visitors, and research animals by unnecessarily exposing them to pesticides.  Therefore, only the most current and effective pest management practices are to be utilized in the IPMP.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, supplies, equipment, supervision, and transportation for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management Program for designated animal care facilities and associated support facilities of the National Institutes of Health.
The contractor shall have an understanding of the concept of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) method of pest control as it is applied in sensitive animal research environments.  IPM is a process that encompasses making accurate decisions as to when pest control measures are needed, the type of control measure(s) to be used, and the method of application.   Management practices in an IPM program are not based on the routine application of pesticides, but on thorough inspections, monitoring for pests, collecting and evaluating data, identifying sanitation deficiencies, modifying structures, and performing and documenting ongoing training for both the pest management contractor and NIH personnel.  This shall include the collection and management of pest control data, generation of required reports, and distribution of those reports.  The contractor shall have an understanding of the principles and practices of sanitation in sensitive animal research facilities and the effects of pests and pest management methods on the occupants.  The contractor shall have a Pesticide Business License, from the Maryland Department of Agriculture in Category VII Industrial, Institutional, and Health Related Pest Control with Sub-categories - (A.) General; (B.) Termite; (C.) Bird; (D.) Rodent, and (E.) Industrial Weed.  The contractor shall demonstrate any special qualifications and experience in conducting pest management programs in sensitive animal care facilities, Biological Safety Level 2 and 3 laboratories, and other similar facilities. The contractor shall be able to meet all current and future requirements of this contract regarding personnel, time commitments, and logistical and technical support and shall adhere to all applicable local, State, and Federal regulations.  The Contractor will be required to provide an approach for the development of IPM programs, service schedules, pest management monitoring, surveying and quality assurance.     The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 561710 with a size standard of $6 Million.     The period of performance shall be for one 12-month base year with four 12-month option periods from date of award.     

If your organization is potentially capable in performing these services, please provide the following information:     1) Organization name, address, email address, website address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization (i.e., small business, small disadvantage business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), and Veteran and/or Service-disabled Veteran); 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability; and 3) Number of facilities managed.     Firms responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused pertinent information is requested.     

RESPONDING FIRMS SHOULD PROVIDE TWO COPIES OF THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT BY January 6, 2006 AT 2:00 PM LOCAL TIME and mail to Terita R. Stevenson, 6011 Executive Boulevard, Room 539-C, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7663.     (NOTE:     If you are using a courier service, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail, the city, state, and zip code should read ROCKVILLE, MD 20852).         

This market survey is being conducted through Find Business Opportunities to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.     The Government has the right to set aside this procurement exclusively for  8(a) or small business participation as the result of this market survey.  By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database (Registration is available via the Internet at www.CCR.gov) prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.     All updates/amendments pertaining to this requirement will only be posted and made available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (Fedbizopps) site at http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>PURPOSE The Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) at NASA has undergone significant changes and restructuring over the past few years.	The purpose of this RFI is to communicate the current structure, elements, mission and products of the IPP in preparation for the issuance of an RFP for services that will replace the prior network which consisted of the Regional Technology Transfer Centers (RTTC), the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC).   A single contractor will be sought to provide services that will recognize current business climates and communication capabilities, with a focus on a technology-based approach to partnership development.  Services will be structured to provide support to NASA Headquarters, all NASA Field Centers, and all program elements of the IPP. IPP program elements include the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Program, the Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Program, the Enterprise Engine (EE), the Technology Transfer (TT) Program and the Space Product Development (SPD) Program.  The EE is a new initiative designed as an investment vehicle to support innovative, dual-use technology development which will help NASA achieve its mission, and also help better position these technologies for future commercial use.	A Request for Information was issued for the EE initiative on February 6, 2006 as Solicitation Number NNH0622806L entitled “Venture Capital Project" (Red Planet Capital). Due to budget reductions, the scope of this anticipated effort will be significantly reduced from the work performed by the prior network.	  IPP MISSION The mission of IPP within NASA is to provide leveraged technology for NASA Mission Directorates, Programs and Projects through technology investments and partnerships with industry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories.   •	Technology investments are made with small businesses under the SBIR Program element, with small businesses working with research institutions under the STTR Program element, and with a variety of entities in conjunction with the EE. •	Technology partnerships are developed under the TT and SPD Program elements.   The primary purpose of all these technology investments and partnerships is to advance the technology position of NASA.  The nature and design of the anticipated activities is expected to yield dividends to both the non-NASA partners and other stakeholders through the development of such things as new products and processes.	  The elements of IPP are in various stages of maturity and redesign, and their full integration is still in progress. Definitions, strategies and metrics are currently being established.   IPP PRODUCTS IPP will provide significant value to NASA through the delivery of a combination of the following products.   •	Emergent technologies – which are anticipated to be delivered primarily by the SBIR, STTR, SPD and EE program elements. •	Technology partnerships – which will pursue technology needs identified by the NASA Mission Directorates, Programs and Projects, and consolidated and communicated by a team headed by the IPP technologist.  These partnerships are anticipated to be delivered primarily by the TT and SPD Programs.  Partnerships are also expected to stem from the IP Management functions at the NASA Centers, and the emergent technologies being developed under the SBIR, STTR and EE Programs.   •	Intellectual property management – which will be performed by TT in close consultation with the Office of General Counsel, and includes evaluation of new technologies for intellectual property protection, licensing and portfolio management. •	Process improvements – will be identified that are integral to the full integration and efficiency of all program elements, and include shared infrastructure investments such as information technology (IT) support systems. •	Nontraditional partnerships – and how to structure and implement them is the goal of all IPP program elements.   REQUEST FOR WHITE PAPERS External organizations and individuals are sought to provide input and comments on how best to structure a contract to provide services to the IPP.  This will be done via the submission of white papers, which may address one or more of the topic areas below.  White papers should not consist of more than five pages of 12-font text and three pages of graphics.  Any submittal that exceeds these page limits will not be reviewed.   Information submitted as a direct response to this RFI will not be made publicly available, but may be used, without credit or reference to the source of the material, in documents that will be made publicly available at a future date.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.   Reviews may be performed by multi-discipline review teams, which may include third parties, such as contractor personnel who support NASA.  As such, to the extent that any information is submitted in response to this RFI is marked as, or construed to be, proprietary or business sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potential that such information may be disclosed to third parties, and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information.  White Paper Topics IPP is seeking input on the following topics, although papers addressing other important aspects relevant to IPP and the anticipated contract are also welcome.  1.	Incentives.  A Cost Plus Award Fee contract is currently anticipated for this work.  Comments on other methods of incentivizing the resultant contractor to achieve optimum performance are being sought.	    2.	Knowledge of Center Capabilities.  IPP considers it critical for the Contractor to develop and maintain an in-depth knowledge of each Center’s areas of expertise, capabilities and technology as they relate to NASA Mission Directorate needs. One suggested method of achieving this level of knowledge would be to co-locate between ½ to 1 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) contractor personnel at each Center.  Comments on this approach and suggested alternatives are being sought.	  3.	Technology Based Partnership Development.  Given budgetary constraints, it will not be possible for any contractor to staff its organization with experts in the many fields of technology of interest to NASA.  Methods to establish a network of knowledgeable, recognized experts with established contacts in specific technology fields on an as-needed basis are being sought. 4.	Communication.	Given the many changes in IPP, new IPP communication strategies with a variety of groups are required.	Optimizing communication within the available budget and priorities will also be challenging.  Methods on how to best communicate within NASA and with various stakeholders are being sought.  5.	Intellectual Property Management. Streamlined approaches on how to identify those technologies which should be protected, as well as how to license them, are being sought. 6.	Innovative Ideas.  New and innovative approaches to doing business are being sought to increase the effectiveness of the Program. All documents should be delivered in electronic format using Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat no later than Monday, March 13, 2006, 4:30 EST to Kathleen.K.Needham@nasa.gov. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement	

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) seeks capability statements from qualified Small Businesses (e.g., small, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, 8(a), HUB Zone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, etc.) having the capability to carry out clinical studies to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of new medications for drug abuse treatment.  As medications are often taken with other treatment drugs or drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, etc), information on the extent and nature of the interaction between the medications and other treatment drugs/drugs of abuse will also be a focus of this contract.  Such studies require the intravenous administration of abused drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, to human subjects. Since a prerequisite for PK studies is the availability of specific assay methods for the quantitative determination of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids (e.g. plasma, urine, feces, saliva, sweat, etc), this project also includes the development and validation of analytical methods, identification of metabolites, and quantification of drug/metabolites in biological samples collected from the clinical studies. All studies must be carried out under pertinent FDA regulations, such as current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) and current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations. The work will require an OHRP (Office for Human Research Protections) -approved assurance of compliance with the HHS regulations (45 CFR 46.103) for the protection of human subjects and a board certified physician on the project. To handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to Vwill be required.  NIDA may also require a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances. Information sent should be relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  (1) Experience: An outline of previous similar projects and work in the field of drug abuse; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists and/or technical personnel who may be assigned as project director and other key positions; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of facilities and equipment required to conduct this type of work.  Any other specific and relevant information about this particular area of procurement that would improve our consideration and evaluation of the information presented is desirable.  Interested organizations must demonstrate and document, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with and the ability to perform the above tasks.  Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include, but not be limited to, contracts both Government and commercial the organization performed, references, i.e., names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organizations capability, e.g., awards, commendations, etc. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.  This is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent for the Government’s use.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement must provide the following:  1) company name and address; 2) point of contact, 3) phone/fax/email; 4) NAICS Codes, 5) business size and status, and 6) capability information in response to the requirement.  Please submit written capability statements by March 10, 2006 to the NIDA Contracting Officer.

<DESC>A market survey is being conducted to gain knowledge of potential qualified Hub-Zone, 8(a), or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business sources and to determine if they can effectively compete for awards under the anticipated multiple award soli citation for performance of Operation, Maintenance, and Minor Construction for US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) facilities in the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  Depending on the number of qualified responding Hub-Zone; 8(a) or  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, this agency may reserve one or more awards for businesses in one or more of these categories.  The primary service required is medical facilities operation, maintenance, and incidental minor construc tion.  Task orders under the anticipated multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts will typically require full-service, continuous-coverage operation and maintenance (O&M) of medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, dema nd, and emergency maintenance.  In addition, task orders may be awarded for construction requirements incidental to O&M (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).  There ar e a wide variety of buildings and finishes (and a variety of building ages and conditions) that will be covered on any given O&M Task Order.  Buildings vary from World War II lapped siding to new pre-engineered metal buildings to towering steel-frame pre-c ast concrete skinned multi-story buildings.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to emergency generators; electrical switchgear; electrical distribution; lighting; plumbing systems; roof and storm drain systems; heating ventilation, a nd air conditioning [HVAC] heating boilers; HVAC water chillers; HVAC cooling towers; HVAC pumps; variable frequency motor controllers; HVAC air handling units; operating room and isolation room pressurization systems; digital HVAC controls; nurse call; pa tient monitoring systems; intrusion detection systems; infant abduction systems; fire detection/alarm systems; fire sprinkler systems; carbon dioxide, wet and dry chemical fire suppression systems; elevators; pneumatic tube and box conveyor transport syste ms; medical gas systems to include medical air compressors, medical vacuum pumps, bulk oxygen tank farms, and medical gas and vacuum distribution and alarm panels; laboratory fume hoods; interior finishes; signage systems; structural building components su ch as roofs and building exterior façade; and passive fire protection systems (including fire and smoke partition integrity maintenance).  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demandi ng O&M tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility  many with a critically ill inpatient population.  Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the indiv idual task orders, but Contractors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from badging to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatm ent and/or medical research facilities. The most applicable NAICS code is 236220 which covers maintenance, repair, and construction of commercial and institutional buildings.  Multiple award Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts with a base and four option year periods are anticipated, with the place of performance dependent upon individual task order requirements.  All task orders will be awarded at a firm-fixed-price.  Services may be required at any of MEDCOMs medical treatment facilities throughout the Continental Unite d States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.     All interested contractors should notify this office in writing by e mail or fax by 4:30 PM Mobile local time on March 10, 2006.  Responses should include (1) Identification of the company as SBA Hub-Zone Certified, SBA 8A certified or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business; (2) Address and point of contact; (3) Past  Experience in performing operation and maintenance of medical facilities (identify the basic scope of the work performed, the size, location, and description of the facility(ies) served, the dates of performance, the percentage of self-performed work, and  the performance rating for the work);  (4) Past Experience in repairs and minor construction projects at medical facilities (identify the basic scope of the work performed, the location and description of the facility(ies) served, the dates of performance , the percentage of self-performed work, and the performance rating for the work);  (5) Corporate experience and knowledge in managing operation and maintenance programs, to include personnel, management of subcontractors, scheduling, procurement of suppli es and materials, use of automated maintenance management systems, quality control, etc.; (6) Prospective offerors ability to perform in certain geographical areas, for example Southwest or Southeast United States.  If a prospective offeror is able to per form in all geographical areas noted in this announcement, so state.  If not, indicate in which areas the prospective offeror can perform.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation No. 2006-N-08412 is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  RFP No. 2006-N-08412 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 05-08, dated Jan. 26, 2006. The associated NAICS code for this acquisition is 621999. 1.0   BACKGROUND:  Recent shortages of inactivated influenza vaccine have highlighted the fragility of the influenza vaccine market and the need for its expansion and stabilization.  Maintaining an abundant influenza vaccine supply is critically important for protecting the public’s health and improving preparedness for an influenza pandemic in the United States (US). An increased supply of monovalent bulk inactivated influenza vaccine would help mitigate trivalent influenza vaccine shortages by increasing the amount of monovalent bulk vaccine available for final manufacturing processing as necessary.  If supplies fall short, this bulk product can be turned into a finished trivalent influenza vaccine product for distribution.  If supplies are sufficient, the bulk vaccine can possibly be held until the following year’s influenza season and developed into vaccines if the circulating strains remain the same.  In either case the decision to fill and finish or hold the bulk concentrates would be made by the Contractor, at the Contractor’s discretion and expense.  However, in no event can this product be sold for distribution outside the US. 2.0  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain proposals for services needed for the production of monovalent bulk inactivated influenza vaccine in excess of what is planned by the Contractor for the upcoming 2006-2007 influenza season and for the following season in 2007-2008. 3.0  QUANTITIES:  This solicitation requires services to produce a quantity of monovalent bulk inactivated influenza vaccine to be determined by the contractor.  The exact number of vaccine doses resulting from this material is dependent on the quantity of bulk product produced and its yield; however, CDC estimates that funds may be available to increase overall production between 5 million and 10 million doses of three strains of monovalent bulk vaccine.  4.0  SPECIAL REQUIREMENT:  Any products proposed under this contract shall be fully licensed for distribution in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance with the production schedule date established in Paragraph 2.0.  Failure to obtain full FDA licensure of the product by the required date will result in rejection of the product by CDC.  5.0  TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:  5.1 Task 1.  Production of Inactivated Monovalent Influenza Vaccine (bulk concentrates): The Contractor shall increase production of inactivated monovalent influenza vaccine bulk concentrates above what the Contractor had been planning to make for either the 2006-2007 through 2007-2008 seasons.  These bulk concentrates shall be produced in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices and capable of being made into trivalent influenza vaccine for use in the United States for the 2006-2008 influenza seasons. This includes all steps associated with egg work, inactivated monovalent concentrate production and purification of all three viral strains  5.2 Task 2.  Storage and Disposition of the Produced Product: CDC will not take possession of the inactivated monovalent bulk vaccine produced under this contract.  After government inspection and testing, the Contractor may, at its option, (1) formulate and finish (pool concentrates, fill, package, label and test the trivalent vaccine in accordance with FDA requirements) and sell the vaccine on the open market, (2) retain the monovalent bulk for use in the following year’s formulation, as appropriate, or (3) dispose of the bulk product as required by law or regulation.  5.3 Task 3.  Reimbursement to the Government in the Event of Product Sale: If the Contractor sells the finished trivalent vaccine on the open market, CDC shall be reimbursed for each dose sold at the per dose price agreed upon at time of award.  This reimbursement shall apply to any year in which the product is sold.  6.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance shall be from date of award until March 29th, 2008, as follows:  6.1 2006-2007 Influenza Season:  The period of performance for the 2006-2007 Influenza Season shall begin on the date of contract award, which is approximately March 30th, 2006 and shall end on March 29th, 2007.  6.2 2007-2008 Influenza Season:  The period of performance for the 2007-2008 Influenza Season shall begin approximately on Mach 30th 2007 and end on March 29th, 2008. 7.0  INSPECTION AND DELIVERY:  7.1 Inspection and Acceptance:  The inactivated monovalent vaccine produced as a result of the services performed under this contract shall be made available to the CDC for final inspection and acceptance of the contractor's vaccine production service no later than August 31st , 2006.  For vaccine produced for the 2007-2008 Influenza Season, inspection and acceptance of vaccine production service will occur no later than August 31st, 2007. Failure to pass inspection may result in rejection of the services and possible termination for cause of the contract.  7.2  Deliverables:  At time of inspection stated above,  the contractor shall provide 2 copies of a report that describes the quantity of excess monovalent bulk vaccine produced and the estimated yield in number of vaccine doses.  Also, how/what was done to expand the production of bulk monovalent over and above what was originally intended.

Vendors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this proposal is based.  All assumptions (both technical and price) shall be included in the proposal.

A.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors.

 	Past Performance
  	Delivery       				

Assumptions, Conditions, and Exceptions will be reviewed for acceptability and potential impact on information provided in the task order proposal.

	1.  Delivery

	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE

	If the vendor has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the sub-factors below, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this SOW.  The past performance information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.

	Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.
	Past performance will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the SOW.
	Each proposal is required to describe a minimum of two but not more than five prior relevant projects that have been completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this SOW.   Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
	Past performance must be relevant to the support required for the delivery order.  Deliverables must meet contract requirements technical excellence, timing, budgeting and report accuracy.  Management must be effective with flexible and responsive staffing with no performance problems or deficiencies that impact task quality, time or cost.  Vendor must meet all requirements in overall satisfaction to end-users.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have a long history, dating back to 1997, regarding the design, fabrication, testing, marketing, and licensing of the "Frostless" electric heat pump for the residential market.  TVA’s Residential energy right Program promotes the marketing and installation of conventional residential electric heat pump HVAC units.  Consequently, electric heat pump HVAC systems represent a large percentage of the residential market in the TVA service area.  During the winter heating season, however, the "Frostless" technology addresses numerous matters of consequential importance to the energy right program when applied to conventional electric heat pump units by providing the following benefits:
•Stabilizes air flow temperature during the defrost cycle
•Eliminates the "cold blow" affect during the defrost cycle
•Indoor resistance heating during the defrost cycle is not required
•Frost accumulation on outdoor coil, if any, takes appreciably longer 
•Resulting energy savings during defrost cycle, 1KW used vs 13KW 
•Operation, efficiency, and reliability significantly increases owner satisfaction 
Description
We are interested in response from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to participate, along with TVA and Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), in design, testing, data acquisition, and licensing of “Frostless” technology.  You must possess the following:

•Many years of operating experience
•A well established reputation   
•Highly recognized and regarded as an OEM to manufacturers of electric residential heat pump HVAC systems

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), a federal government agency, serves as the leading source of quality data about the nation’s people and economy. More than just numbers, this information shapes important policy decisions that help improve the nation’s social and economic conditions. The Census Bureau’s mission is built around large-scale surveys and censuses. Activities involve survey and questionnaire design, geographic infrastructure update, and data collection, processing, and dissemination. Research and data analysis help improve processes from data collection through dissemination. Its major programs are the periodic censuses, current surveys, and a wide range of reimbursable work for other agencies. The Census Bureau is planning to conduct an experiment for the 2006 National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG) and National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) using incentives to influence higher response rates. The Census Bureau will send $5 and $10 incentive/gift cards with survey questionnaires to incentivize individuals to complete and return the questionnaires. The results will be analyzed and evaluated to assess the impact of incentive/gift cards on response rates. The Census Bureau might continue to experiment on other surveys using incentive/gift cards of other monetary denominations. The incentive/gift cards shall have the following characteristics: 1) be universally accepted in retail establishments in the same manner as major credit or debit cards, 2) be available in prepaid denomination amounts in $5 increments up to $50 with face values clearly marked, 3) once activated, have an active period of at least 12 months with no decrease in value, 4) come with instructions for activating the card, and 5) have toll-free telephone support. The cards may be generic with no special markings or embossing other than what the vendor might use as a standard practice. The Census Bureau intends to award one blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with an ordering period of one year under which orders may be placed with a cumulative value not exceeding $250,000. The Census Bureau intends to place orders under the BPA, for all its requirements for incentive/gift cards occurring within the term of the BPA, without further competition, up to the cumulative ceiling value specified above. All orders under the BPA will have the following delivery address: U.S. Census Bureau, National Processing Center, Attn: Mr. Fred McKee, 1201 E. 10th Street, Jeffersonville, IN 47132. The orders under the anticipated BPA will have a requirement for monthly reports that provide data on (i) the number of cards activated within the month, (ii) the total dollar value of all activated cards, (iii) the total value of all purchases for the month, and (iv) the total cumulative value of all purchases. The Census Bureau intends to place an initial order for 5,180 incentive/gift cards at the time of contract award. Of this total, 2,590 cards shall have a value of $5 each and 2,590 shall have a value of $10 each. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures authorized under FAR Subpart 13.500. The identifying number is PR-44060.

Assets, for the purposes of this size standard, means the assets defined according to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 034 call report form. The Government intends to make an award decision based on best value to the Government, considering factors such as price, conformance to the Government’s requirement, and past performance. To be considered for award, interested parties shall prepare responses that include (i) pricing for the items specified above as the Government’s initial order (including all fees and bulk shipping costs), (ii) pricing schedule for gift cards up to $50 face value, (iii) vendor information including information required by the provisions and clauses specified herein, and (iv) descriptive literature of their gift card program.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. [ENTER NUMBER] TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR CORD REELS AND CABLE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to make the following clarifications: SENSOR ASSEMBLY 1. Please clarify that the overall length of 250ft is measured from end of connector to end of blunt cut end, we will use standard industry practices for the plus/minus tolerances on overall length please advise  >From connector face to end of tinned wire is the correct measure.  250 feet +/- 3 inches. 2. RPP states "connectorized end to match pin-out of Site Transceiver input connector " - the connector has four contacts lettered A-D, the bulk cable specified is a four conductor cable with (1) green/yellow conductor and (3) blue conductors each numbered. since the opposite end of the cable is being left blunt, we will need to know the wiring diagram:  			 Pin a = green/yellow 			 Pin b = blue (1) 			 etc....  We require a color coding like the standard ones used by Belden and some other vendors where each wire in a cable is a different color.  The reason is that when you're out in the woods at 3:00 AM working by flashlight, reading miniscule numbers on wires that are all the same color is nearly impossible.  The connectors we must have are:  	    MALE CONNECTORS MS3101F-14S-2P  for sensors 	    MALE MS3101F14S-6P CONNECTORS for power 3. RFP states, free end of cable to be stripped and "splayed 2" with each conductor stripped and tinned" - can you clarify: 	a. strip length for removal of outer jacket - do not want to assume 2"	       	b. strip length of individual conductors on "free" end - normal for tinning is .25"  Cut off 2" of the outer jacket, strip 1/4" of each conductor and tin.  POWER ASSEMBLY 1. Please clarify that the overall length of 250ft is measured from end of connector to end of blunt cut end, we will use standard industry practices for the plus/minus tolerances on overall lenght - please advise  >From connector face to end of tinned wire is the correct measure.  250 feet +/- 3 inches. 2. RPP states "connectorized end to match pin-out of Site Transceiver power connector " - the connector has four contacts lettered A-F, the bulk cable specified is a seven conductor cable with (1) green/yellow conductor and (6) blue conductors each numbered. since the opposite end of the cable is being left blunt, we will need to know the wiring diagram:  			 Pin a = green/yellow 			 Pin b = blue (1) 			 Pin c = blue (2) etc  .....

CORD REEL 1. Will the cable assembly require male pins on the connectorized end? The male connectors for the cables are: 	MALE CONNECTORS MS3101F-14S-2P for sensor cables 	MALE MS3101F14S-6P CONNECTORS for power cables 2. The RFP states that the reel should be able to accommodate 500 ft of cable. The cables are 250 ft.  Please advise if reel capacity needs to be 500ft. The cables will be 250' and the reels "able" to hold 500' 3.  Can the Cord Reel be made of metal?   The cord reels should be visible and are required to have the least amount of metal as possible.   We prefer a cord reel made of all plastic.  4. Does the reel need to stand on it own during reeling and unreeling? have a carrying handle?   The reel may have either a rotating axle or a handle that allows for a walking outlay of cable.	It must have some method of reeling the cable back in.	Typical models are visible at building supply houses.  5. Verify shipping per article 3 of the contact proposal: ship cables already reeled? or ship each cable w/ reel in an individual box?  Either way is acceptable.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.
