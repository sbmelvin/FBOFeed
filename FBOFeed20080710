<CONTACT>Pamela S. Hale, Phone 9376566073, Email pamela.hale@wpafb.af.mil - 
<DESC><p>This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 312th Aeronautical Systems Group (312 AESG) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to GE Aviation for F-16 Advanced Data Transfer Equipment (ADTE) Production Upgrade. GE Aviation is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the ADTE integrated on the F-16, and is the only firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience, and technical data required to perform these efforts. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 contract award will include a basic quantity and contract options through FY13 for a total production of approximately 1200 units. An F-16 Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program procured the product as a qualified off-the-shelf form and fit replacement for a baseline Data Transfer Unit (DTU). The increased throughput and additional memory capacity provided by ADTE is required for a future core software upgrade, commencing September 2008, with planned development testing in July 2010 and a planned fielding of Sep 2012. It is required to support this core software upgrade Design Try-Out (DTO) phase, currently underway and slated for flight testing beginning in March 2009, with the qualified ADTE equipment. A risk reduction effort for ADTE integration is nearing completion; this effort was essential to support the FY08 DTO requirements development and upcoming FY09 testing, heavily burdened by Universal Armament Interface (UAI) challenges and schedule constraints. This schedule must be maintained in order to field the planned core software upgrade and system integration on time. It is not in the best interest of the government to fund and certify a new data transfer unit, thus, increasing the cost and impacting the schedule. The government does not own the data rights for the system, therefore, to avoid duplication costs, the government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. For subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may submit appropriate information to GE POC Jim Mummert at 301-428-6352, or james.mummert@ge.com at GE Aviation. The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement action is 334119, Computer Peripheral Equipment, Not Elsewhere Qualified. Please indicate number of employees relative to the size standard of 1,000 for determination of small business status. Respondees shall include their assigned DUNS number and their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. The Point of Contact for this action is 312 AESG/PK, 2725 C Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7424, Attn: Pamela Hale, Phone:(937) 656-6073, and Email: Pamela.hale@wpafb.af.mil. Any technical questions should be referred to Kimberly Fischer at (937) 656-4603, e-mail Kimberly.fischer@wpafb.af.mil. The Contracting Officer is Bob Kline, (937) 656-6043, e-mail Robert.kline@wpafb.af.mil. In accordance with AFMC Clause 5352.201-9101, the ASC Ombudsman for this effort is Ms. Karen Emery, ASC/CS, 1845 4th Street, B14, R203, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (Phone: 937-255-6356; E- Mail: Karen.emery@wpafb.af.mil).</p>

As PBGC moves along this path of greater diversification it would like to take advantage of strategic partners in some of its allocation to private equity and real estate.  By utilizing strategic partners it will enable PBGC to gain excellent investment partners and access to the resources of those firms including, but not limited to, comprehensive risk management measurement and mitigation, consolidated reporting, data sources and analysis, staff augmentation, and staff development and training.  To support this effort, PBGC is seeking the services of a consultant to assist a Technical Evaluation Panel in the selection of strategic partners during the technical review process.

Any Contractor selected for this effort will be required to:

  attend oral proposals conducted at PBGCs facilities at 1200 K St. NW, Washington, DC  from Sep 29-Oct. 3 (dates approximate)
  attend site visits for potential firms from Oct. 14-17 (dates approximate)
  attend TEP meetings held Sep 8, Oct. 6, and Oct. 20 at PBGCs facilities (dates approximate)

Section 2.0 DefinitionsCorrective Engineering  Changes necessitated by actual design errors and/or designdeficiencies.  Corrective engineering consists of activities normally considered to beerror correction required to keep the system operational.  By its nature, correctiveengineerng is usually a reactive  process.  Corrective engineering is related to thesystem not performing as originally intended.  The three main causes of correctiveengineering are (1) design errors, (2) logic errors, and (3) coding errors.

<DESC>Subject: Draft Standard AO is available for commentDRAFT STANDARD ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PI-LED MISSIONSThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issues this DRAFT StandardPI-led Mission Announcement of Opportunity (AO) to solicit community comments.This DRAFT Standard PI-led Mission AO represents a restructuring of previous NASA AOs forPI-led missions (e.g., 2006 Discovery Program AO, 2006 Mars Scout Program AO, 2007 SmallExplorer Program AO). It is the product of an effort by NASA (the AO SimplificationTeam) to simplify and remove burden from the community in generating Step 1 proposalsthat respond to AOs. The AO Simplification effort has solicited comments from theproposing, evaluating, and implementing communities. There have been several communityannouncements, town halls at science conferences, and community workshops to discuss thepros and cons of AO Simplification and specific ideas with the community. The AOSimplification Team has received over 700 specific suggestions from the community and hasconsidered all of them. A White Paper has been developed by the AO Simplification Teamthat captures the rationale for many of the decisions that were made in writing the DRAFTStandard PI-led Mission AO. That White Paper will be posted on the same NSPIRES websiteas this DRAFT AO.It is NASAs intent that this AO clearly and unambiguously states the policies thatgovern the solicitation, selection, and implementation of PI-led mission investigationssolicited by NASA for any of its PI-led mission programs (including New Frontiers,Discovery, Mars Scout, Explorer, Earth System Science Explorers (ESSP)). This AOstandardizes the language and policies, to the maximum extent possible, that NASA uses inits PI-led mission AOs. To simplify the nature of the response necessary, this AO clearlyand unambiguously states and numbers the requirements that all proposals shall meet inorder to represent a compliant response to this AO. This AO clearly separates proposalrequirements that apply to proposals from the program policies and requirements thatapply to investigations that have been selected to proceed into Phase A Concept Studies.The successful proposer, however, will have a good understanding of the tasks necessaryduring Phase A and beyond.It is intended that the standards established by this AO will be the template for allfuture SMD PI-led Mission AOs with deviations allowed for program specific requirements.The Draft Standard PI-led Mission AO is available in NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com , select "Solicitations", select "Open Solicitations").NASA welcomes comments and suggestions on this DRAFT Standard PI-led Mission AO, whichwill be available from July 10, 2008, through July 31, 2008. Comments are welcome on anytopic, but are especially welcome where they identify policies, practices, or specificlanguage that are unclear, ambiguous, nonoptimal, or unnecessary.Comments should be addressed to aosimplify@nasa.gov no later than July 31, 2008, in orderto be most useful. Please include the phrase AO COMMENT (without quotes) in the subjectline of any comment submitted.Questions or requests for further information may be addressed to Dr. Paul Hertz, ChiefScientist, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Telephone:202-358-0986; Email: paul.hertz@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ, intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Hydraulics International, Inc. (HII), Chatsworth, CA. The Government intends to procure spare parts to provide interim support for the Fluid Servicing Units (FSUs), PNs 061475-100, 061477-100, 061479-100, and 061481-100 under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, as HII is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole source designer and manufacturer of the FSUs. The FSUs, which consist of the Aircraft Engine Oil Fill Unit for dispensing MIL-PRF-23699, the Aircraft Transmission Fluid Fill Unit for dispensing DOD-PRF-85734, the Aircraft Tail Rotor Transmission Fill Unit for dispensing MIL-PRF-21260 and the Hydraulic Fluid Servicing Unit for dispensing MIL-PRF-83282 (hereafter referred to as the FSUs), are handheld manually pumped servicing units capable of providing fluid at adequate pressures to top off or fill hydraulic, engine oil, gearbox and other fluid reservoirs. The FSUs replace the existing fluid servicing units with a family of servicing units that will provide continued fleet support as well as provide fleet servicing unit refill options. The FSUs are being procured to replace all applications of the PON-6 and HSU-1 units with servicing units that are less liable for cross fluid contamination, ergonomic, less costly to procure, support and repair and designed in such a way as to provide uniqueness to each type to eliminate the possibility of user error. HII is currently under contract with the U.S. Navy to produce the FSUs. HII is the designer, developer, and OEM of the FSUs. They are the only known source to have spare parts available to meet the time constraints and short deadline requirement to fulfill the program requirements for support and meet Initial Operating Capability (IOC). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earthquake Hazards Program, requires a near-real-time, low-cost, low-maintenance; Internet-capable strong-motion system that records earthquake ground motion from triaxial accelerometers ("the appliance") and associated server software.  The recording instruments will have a dynamic range of ~ 90dB (or better) and is suited for extensive urban deployments where the cultural noise level is relatively high.  The USGS envisions installing urban arrays of 500 to 1000 or more appliances with spacing of ~ 100 to 1000 meters to operate with low maintenance and operational cost for ~ 10 years, utilizing the extensive Internet infrastruture in urban areas to minimize telemetry expenses.  The appliance will have built-in wireless Ethernet hardware to allow access to wireless routers operating in residences and offices; automatically forward event waveforms, parametric data, and health messages to a server via the Internet; store event waveform and parametric data indefinitely if connection is lost until reestablished; initiate all connections to the operator's server to transmit information; and be easily serviceable by hosts of the appliance.  Also, the appliance should be able to collect and store data without any telemetry connection whatsoever.  The successful contractor must have a working unit in production that either has been tested by the USGS or can be submitted for testing at the time of proposal submission.  Detailed mandatory and desired specifications and evaluation criteria will be given in the RFP.
The USGS expects to award a single fixed-price indefinite-delivery contract for one year commencing date of award with four option periods consisting of 12 months each; total ordering period NTE 5 years.  RFP will be issued on or about July 21, 2008.  This will be a commercial acquisition in accordance with the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.  The applicable NAICS code is 334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, for which the associated size standard is 500 employees.  This notice and any resulting soliciation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective June 12, 2008.  For further information regarding this announcement, please contact Janet Janes, Contracting Officer, at (916) 278-9343 or jjanes@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a solicitation for a construction project for Environmental Restoration of the Mill River and Mill Pond, Stamford, Connecticut.  The estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Mill River is the lower reach of the Rippowam River that flows through the center of the city of Stamford, Connecticut and empties into Long Island Sound.  The purpose of this project is to restore the aquatic and riparian resources of the Mill River to a healthy, viable, and self-maintaining river system, including restoration of anadromous fish passage.  Within the project area, the rivers ecosystem is degraded with a ten-foot concrete dam, a sediment laden impoundment, concrete walls bordering the river that eliminate riparian habitat, filled inter-tidal marshes invaded by phragmites, and invasive plant species impacting riparian areas.  Restoration measures include:  dewatering the Mill Pond using 35,000 square feet of sheet piling; demolition of the 10-foot high, 140-foot long, concrete dam upstream of Main Street; removal of 2,200 linear feet of concrete wall, averaging 10 feet in height, bordering the Mill Pond; associated demolition of pavement, trees and walkways; and removal of over 1,000 tons of mass concrete under the Pulaski Street Bridge.  Work also includes: excavation and disposal off-site of approximately 5,800 cubic yards of sediment behind the dam; moving and grading of approximately 20,000 cubic yards of clean material at the Mill Pond site; and excavation and disposal off-site of 3,300 cubic yards of organic material.  In addition, 1.5 acres of the riparian corridor will be restored through removal of exotic and invasive plant species and planting of native riparian vegetation (grasses, bushes and trees) and 1,100 feet of river channel in the Mill Pond reach will be restored with a natural riffle/pool sequence of river stone.  Construction is expected to begin in the winter of 2009. The estimated issue date for this procurement is on or about 25 July 2008. Interested bidders can download the solicitation via the Federal Business opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The due date for the bid will be stated in the solicitation. Requests for solicitation documents by telephone, fax or email will not be honored. Instructions for bid submissions will be provided in the solicitation. All response sources may submit a bid for consideration by the New England District.

<DESC><p>The Air Force is interested in assessing the performance envelope of sources capable of developing and harnessing technologies supporting the "Improved Methods for Determining Thermophysical and Thermochemical Properties" program. Sources are sought having the required knowledge and demonstrated capability to developing new test methods to determine the thermochemical and thermophysical properties of advanced fluids and lubricants, including coolants with tailorable properties such as nanofluids and phase change materials, hydraulic fluids, gas turbine engine oils and greases. Where applicable, existing test methods may be used. The new test methods must be validated and proven to provide accurate and repeatable data. The research efforts of the Air Force Research Laboratory's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate's Nonstructural Materials Branch produce a wide variety of candidate advanced base fluids, additives and formulations. The anticipated chemical classes of the majority of the anticipated candidate materials are the polyalphaolefins and the perfluoropolyalkylethers. Their unique chemistry results in many of the existing test methods, which were originally developed to study mineral oil based fluids, to be not applicable. An example of this is the four ball wear test (ASTM D2266), which usually predicts the boundary lubricating ability of candidate lubricants quite well. This test method predicts that the perfluoropolyalkylether-based fluids would function quite well in boundary lubrication regimes, but when attempts are made to use them in application where the primary lubrication regime is boundary, they are totally unacceptable. Another deficiency with currently available test methods is that they frequently require significantly larger sample sizes than are typically available with advanced fluids and lubricants based on newly emerging materials technology. Thermochemical and thermophysical properties of interest include: thermal and oxidative stabilities up to 425 degrees C, Corrosion-0xidation stability up to 400 degrees C, thermal conductivity up to 325 degrees C, specific heat, heat of vaporization of liquid to gas phase change coolants and heat of fusion for solid to liquid phase change materials, pressure-viscosity and pressure-density coeffients for pressures from 0 to 3000 psia at temperatures up to 325 degrees C, isothermal secant and adiabatic tangent bulk moduli, flammability characteristics, kinematic and absolute viscosities from -54 to 350 degrees C, corrosion inhibition properties, vapor pressure up to 400 degrees C, pour points down to -70 degrees C, lubricity up to 400 degrees C, oxygen sensitivity and metal analysis. The lubricity test methods must be capable of determining wear as a function of actual time, measureing coefficient of friction and fluid and metal test temperature. All of the techniques must be capable of using as small volume as possible since these candidate materials will typically be available in small quantities initially.
<p>The period of performance for the entire program is 65 months; 60 months of technical effort, and five (5) months for completing a final technical report. The program will initially consist of one (1) task order that will incude the following objectives: 1. Determine thermochemical and thermophysical properties of advance fluids and lubricants, and 2. Develop and validate suitable improved test methods for determining the critical thermochemical and thermophysical properties of advanced fluids and lubricants when the existing test methods are not suitable or practical.</p>
<p>Key technical requirements of this program shall include the following characteristics: <br /><br />(a) Development of critical thermochemical and thermophysical properties of advanced fluids and lubricants using existing test methods if applicable.</p>
<p>(b) Developing new test methods where existing methods either are not applicable or do not provide adequate information on the potential performance of the material in its intended application.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a Statement of Capabilities reflecting their interest and capability in meeting the requirements above. Information submitted should be pertitent and specific in the technical area under consideration, as outlined above and for each of the following qualifications:</p>
<p>(1) Experience-Provide an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed, or any in-house research and development effort or similar type of work that is currently being performed.<br />(2) Personnel-Provide the name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineering, and other technical personnel who could be assigned as a principal investigator and project officers / technical support personnel.<br />(3) Facilities-Provide availability and description of special facilities required to performed in the technical areas under consideration. Include supplemental lab facilities if available.<br />(4) Other Qualifications-Provide other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement, which would enhance the government's consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.</p>
<p>Please include the following with your response: name and address of firm; point of contact and telephone number; business size (i.e, large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUB Zone, HBCU/MI-historically black colleges and universities/minority institutions).</p>
<p>Statements of capabilities are due electronically to the Air Force no later than 25 July 2008, and shall be forwarded to the following e-mail address: Gary.Victor@wpafb.af.mil. Address contractual questions to Gary Victor, Contract Negotiator (DET 1 AFRL/PKMN), via (937) 255-5435.

<DESC>     My name is Betty Hoge. I am a Contract Specialist for the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), a branch of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), in San Antonio, Texas.  In the near future we will be issuing a solicitation for gaseous helium used by the U. S. military in the Middle East.  Through this market research, I am seeking sources - names of contractors and their points of contact who are interested in submitting offers for this requirement.  

        The helium specifications are as follows:  Type 1, Grade A (99.995% purity) gaseous helium IAW MIL-PRF-27407C, dated 29 Nov 2007.  The estimated volume for the 4.5 year performance period (01 April 2009 to 30 Sep 2013) is 453,600 cubic meters.  Delivery is FOB origin. The contractor will fill Government owned tube trailers and High Pressure Cylinder Assemblies (HPCAs) with helium and, after inspection and acceptance, provide ground transportation to the nearest military aerial port, where we will airlift the full trailers and/or HPCAs to a central location in Baghdad.  We will also airlift the empty trailers/HPCAs from Baghdad to the nearest military aerial port where the helium contractor will pick them up, make needed repairs, fill them, and store them until notified to deliver the helium filled tube trailers or HPCAs back to the military aerial port. We will, in effect, create a helium supply chain to Iraq.  

        Inspection, repair, and maintenance of the Government owned tube trailers and HPCAs will be included in the requirement, as well as hydrostatic or acoustic testing of out-of-test trailer tubes and HPCA cylinders. The contractor will be responsible for round trip ground transportation of full trailers/HPCAs  from the contractor's facility to the nearest military aerial port and empty trailers/HPCAs from the aerial port to the contractor's facility.  The contractor will be required to securely store approximately (not to exceed) 12 full tube trailers and 18 full HPCAs until notified by the Contracting Officer, or appointed representative, to transport them to the designated port.  

        The anticipated timeframe for release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is between late September 2008 and early October 2008.   Please reply to this email with the full name of your company, the name of a Point of Contact, an email address, and telephone number.  In so doing, you will be assured of receiving a courtesy copy of the pending RFP directly from me by email.  The solicitation will also be posted in Federal Business Opportunities.

The vendor should also include any previously completed work similar in size and scope of work, to demonstrate expertise.  NOSTRA currently hand-sorts over 4000 single page orders by hand per day which is very time consuming and labor intensive.  NOSTRA is seeking a networked printer that will perform the sorting of the single page orders in an automated fashion based on a set criteria which is dynamic and requires the printer to determine which tray to pull from and which output bin to send to.  The printer must be able to receive print jobs from our backend system which sends print jobs to the print queue in an ASCII format.  The printer must parse the dynamic data in the print job and determine, based on the dynamic data in the given field or fields, which colored paper to use and which output bin to send the order to.  The printer must have a minimum of eleven (11) output bins.  Due to the volume of orders that are received on any given day, the printer must also have a minimum of one high-capacity drawer and a minimum of 2 low-capacity drawers.  Other minimum requirements: 128MB RAM (expandable to 640MB), 50 ppm (48 ppm for A4), Time to first page 8.5 seconds, Intuitive operator panel with graphical user interface, Hard disk data encryption for print job data security and printing restriction Noise Level, Idle 30 dBA,  Print Noise Level, Operating 55 dBA, Maximum Monthly Duty Cycle: Up to 250000 Pages per month, Specified Operating Environment Temperature: 16 to 32C (60 to 90F), Humidity: 8 to 80% Relative Humidity  RFID UHF Optional writer add-on.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is SA1301-8-RP-0018. The solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09. The full text of clauses referenced herein may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/.The NAICS code is 611310LAW SCHOOLS, and the associated small business size standard is $6.5M. The Government shall award one fixed unit priced time and materials contract as a result of this RFP. THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN Request for Proposal 

1.	BACKGROUND 

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Governments Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the regions preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have knowledge and understanding of complex commercial law.  

CLDP provides assistance to a number of universities in the Arabian Gulf region to enhance their commercial law curriculum and instruction. During the base period of the contract, as part of its work with Sultan Qaboos College of Law in Oman, and the University of Bahrain, College of Law (UB), CLDP will help establish commercial arbitration oriented moot court programs that will equip students with the skills to represent clients in commercial arbitrations.  The focal point of organization for this program will be participation in the Wilhelm C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot in Vienna in the spring of 2009.  CLDP seeks to augment its in-house expertise as it assists these universities in this initiative.  Specifically, CLDP seeks collaboration with a partner that will provide expertise and help implement a multi-stage assistance plan. The anticipated contract will have two additional option periods where the scope of work will be the same but the schools receiving the CLDP assistance may be different. The department of Commerce intends to issue the names and locations of the schools to the contractor at the same time a modification is issued to exercise the option period of the contract.  Those schools may be universities or colleges of law from countries in the region, including Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.

2.  SCOPE OF WORK
In particular, during the base period of the contract (the schools to be assisted and the academic years will be changed during the option periods of the contract) the Contractor will be called upon by CLDP to do the following:

2.1	Assist CLDP in refining and implementing a multi-stage assistance plan over 
the course of the 2008/2009 academic year to Sultan Qaboos University in Oman, and the University of Bahrain.  

2.2	Work with Sultan Qaboos University to develop the structure of their moot court program. 

2.3	Train the responsible faculty at Sultan Qaboos University in management of the moot court program and instruction techniques. 

2.4	Equip responsible faculty and student participants at Sultan Qaboos University with fundamental understanding of international arbitration principles. 

2.5	Facilitate linkages between those universities (Sultan Qaboos University and the University of Bahrain) and other programs from the Arabic speaking world and beyond at the Vis Competition. 

2.6	Assist the University of Bahrain to further strengthen and institutionalize their moot court program established with CLDP assistance during the 2007/2008 academic year.  This program supports the longer term goal of establishing a regional international arbitration moot and, therefore, the work will include advising the universities to this end.  

2.7	Develop and implement introductory course/consultations at Sultan Qaboos University, comprising 1-2 weeks, providing relevant faculty and participants with a fundamental grasp of international commercial arbitration concepts, legal research and writing. 

2.8 Develop and implement 2 programs at strategic intervals throughout the 
academic year, lasting 4-5 days, at Sultan Qaboos University providing assistance with coaching techniques and drilling.

2.9 Develop and implement a networking activity for delegations from the universities listed in 2.1 at the Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot       facilitating linkages with at least 3 other participating law schools.

3.1	Report to the CLDP office, at the earliest convenience, any issues that may impair Contractors work and the performance of the contract;

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue an order to TVN Entertainment, Inc, 4111 W Alameda Ave, Ste 401, Burbank, CA 91505, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The proposed procurement is to provide Video-On-Demand (VOD) services to cable and satellite companies across the United States in support of The Pentagon Channels business and operational objectives located at Alexandria, VA. Rationale for sole source: Research has shown that there are many companies that provide video-on-demand (VOD) services but many of these companies do not provide a true broadcast quality VOD or only provide the software or partial service for distribution of VOD.  A large portion of VOD providers push Near VOD, a pay-per-view or a Push VOD technique that lacks the interactivity to provide true VOD.  What has become common is that many VOD providers do not provide an all inclusive service and have not networked themselves into the market across the country but only in limited marker areas.  Our research included a web based search of VOD providers who provided services to cable companies that utilize or would like to utilize Pentagon Channel programming but lack the channel space until full digital conversion.  Broadcast VOD can not be confused with web VOD. However, efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from many sources is  not possible based upon the following set of facts:	a. Reach  TVN currently packages, distributes and manages more than 3000 hours of VOD programming every month from more than 150 content providers.  This includes most of the major network and cable providers around the world. b. Deployment - TVN holds over 90% of the video on demand market, making them the largest VOD provider in the US.  TVN is deployed to over 300 cable head ends and is integrated with every combination of VOD server, middleware, IPG and set-top box.  TVN is the only single source solution for On Demand programming.  TVN offers content services including aggregation, metadata creation, encoding, distribution, asset management and 24- hour customer technical support. c. Experience -   Their diversity of content and special marketing needs is proven with their current cliental of over 80 small and medium sized markets.  Optimizing the content mix, providing turn-key programs and supplying intuitive management tools that are critical to launching and managing a cost-effective VOD solution.
This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Quote (RFQ). A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Sources of Information Sought: SCISSORS 

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is the Program Manager for the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program. Under this program DSCP has awarded multiple contracts to various distributors to supply the Department of Defense and other Government medical treatment facilities (hospitals, clinics, etc.) with medical/surgical supplies. Because these contracts exceed $194,000, the provisions of the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) apply as specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 25.4 et seq. and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) 225.401 et seq. 

The TAA requires that Federal government procure only end items manufactured in the United States, Qualifying Countries and Designated Countries.  End items not manufactured in one of these categories are considered to be manufactured in non-designated countries.

 Medical items manufactured in non-designated countries are prohibited from supply under the TAA, unless the DSCP seeks and is granted relief from the requirements of TAA.  Therefore, the DSCP requests your response to this Request for Information (RFI).

 The information obtained regarding country of origin for your products will be analyzed to determine whether or not DSCP will seek relief from the requirements of the TAA.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS
<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with High Precision Devices located in Boulder, Colorado, for the purchase of a Denali Model 102 cryocooler-type ADR cryostat (Square, Closed-Cycle, adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator-ADR).</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirements for a Square, Closed-Cycle, adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator that will meet the demands of the Quantum Sensors Project here at NIST. This project can only use the Denali Model 102 cryocooler-type ADR cryostat (Square, Closed-Cycle, adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator-ADR) refrigerator. High Precision's Denali Model 102 refrigerator reaches 0.05 Kelvin using a combination of a pulse tube cryocooler and an existing adiabatic demagnetization unit. High Precision is the only vendor that offers this type of refrigeration capabilities. Specifically, this project needs to test cryogenic sensors that only function properly at the refrigerator's 0.05 Kelvin operating temperature. The development of these sensors is required for this NIST project to include measurements of the cosmic microwave background and ultrahigh resolution X- and gamma-ray spectroscopy.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation to include detailed specifications as identified above in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the National Business Group on Health, a non-profit organization, on a sole source basis, to develop a training program for use of the Employee Assistant Programs (EAP) Toolkit.  The period of performance will be from September 30, 2008 through September 29, 2009.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, through the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) has recognized that private and public sector companies and entities employ the majority of all Americans.  Many of these employers provide evaluation, counseling and referral services through Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) for employees and family members who experience mental health dysfunction or who have mental illness.  Consistent with a public health model, CMHS works to ensure that the quality of the services provided by these employers is consistent and of the highest possible caliber.   This has included CMHS support of the development of a recently completed Employee Assistance Program Toolkit.  While development of the EAP Toolkit represents an important contribution to the field in terms of best practices CMHS recognizes that timely development of related training programs will facilitate speedy adoption and use of these best practices. 

The National Business Group on Health produced the EAP toolkit.  They have the staff expertise and have unique knowledge of the content of the EAP toolkit,  and therefore are in the unique position to develop the training for the EAP toolkit.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements should be submitted by 11 am July 25, 2008 to keith.austin@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the Board on Health Sciences Policy, Institute of Medicine, a non-profit organization, on a sole source basis, to become a member of the Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Catastrophic Events.  The period of performance will be the date of award through March 31, 2009.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

As called for in the Presidential Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has established a Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Catastrophic Events (the Forum).  The Forum is designed to provide its members with a venue for exchanging information and presenting individual views, and allow a structured opportunity for dialogue and discussion while scrutinizing critical and possibly contentious scientific and policy issues.  Representatives from government, industry, professional societies, foundations, academia, and other interested parties are expected to serve on the Forum, which will convene three times a year to confer on subject areas of mutual interest and concern.  AHRQ would like to become a member of this forum through the purchase of a membership.  By purchasing this membership, AHRQ, along with the other organizations, will play a unique role in developing a national strategy for public health awareness.  As a key player in developing strategies and tools for public health awareness, AHRQ already has the distinction of being the administrators of a significant portion of contracts that develop plans and different approaches in the event of a catastrophe.  AHRQ should be involved in this forum which will promote open discussion of existing systems and lessons learned form previous catastrophic events, and identify areas of improvement.  Several areas have been identified as critical to ensuring adequate medical preparedness.  These topics fall within five broad categories: (1) Communication and Cooperation; (2) Personal and Community Resilience; (3) Preparedness of Infrastructure Needs; (4) Medical and Public Health Response; and (5) Evaluation of Existing Systems.

The Institute of Medicine established the Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Catastrophic Events as called for in the Presidential Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21.  IOM is the organization that Homeland Security named to organize and convene this forum.  IOM is the only organization named to convene this forum and it is the only source that is bringing together stakeholders at this level to have a dialogue on preparedness issues for the health of our nation in the event that a catastrophic event occurs.
The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements should be submitted by 11 am July 25, 2008 to keith.austin@psc.hhs.gov.

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has procured a term software licensing agreement and software maintenance with Freight Desk Technologies, Inc (Freight Desk), a U.S. small business.  The requested term software license is Freight Desks proprietary FDFolio Suite software, from which TSA has developed the Freight Assessment System (FAS).

The Freight Desk FDFolio Suite is only offered by Freight Desk Technologies, and its software suite is proprietary to Freight Desk Technologies. TSA based the single source on the significant amount of time, cost, and effort for TSA to acquire another vendor to develop their own version of an application that supports (air) supply chain operations, interoperable, risk-based and compatible with existing the air supply chain industry, and DHS/TSA programs. TSA's market research results show no company has both components of risk based and air supply chain software without significant modification and cost.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm, fixed-price quotes are requested under Request for Quotation (RFQ) Solicitation number DLQ080044.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  This solicitation is set-aside for small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990.  The Small Business Annual Receipts for the firm and its Affiliates, for the preceding three (3) fiscal years does not exceed $6.5 million.
The line item number is: Line Item 0001 Adit Closure - Installing Bat Gate Culverts and 7 Adits, Quantity, 1 Lump Sum.
Scope of Work - Castle Creek and War Eagle Mountain AML Remediation
Background:  Abandoned Mine Land (AML) investigations were conducted from the years 2000 to 2004 by the Boise District in the Castle Creek and War Eagle Mountain area within the Owyhee Field Office.  These investigations resulted in the discovery of a number of dangerous mine workings at AML sites in this area.  All of the workings pose significant threats to public safety.  This is especially true due to the increase in public visitation to the area in the past few years.  
This project will reduce or eliminate safety hazards for 3 of the top priority sites that are located on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
Issue:  The sites consist of 4 open shafts and 1 open adit.  All are located in Owyhee County, Idaho.  All openings are easily accessible and are potentially very hazardous to the public.  All the prospects are located in the vicinity of Oreana and Silver City, Idaho and are readily accessible by vehicle and are getting frequent visits from the public.  Because of the physical safety hazards found at these sites, the proposal is to mitigate and remedy any hazards these sites pose to the public while at the same time protecting habitat for bats where there are concerns.
Remediation of abandoned open mine workings would depend on the type of opening, stability of an opening, and if wildlife habitat within a working (bat habitat) needs to be protected.  Any adit that has the potential for bat habitat, even if bat surveys identify no current use, will have bat gates or bat gate culverts installed.  Work would consist of installing BLM approved bat gate culverts at four sites (one adit and four shafts).  Solidifying foam would be used to help close off openings and seal the bat gate culverts in place.  All work areas would utilize waste rock from adjacent mine workings for custom finish work, fill, and contouring.
Work Performance:  Specific work to be performed by the contractor is listed below by each site of concern.  Where bat gate culverts are to be installed the structures will be supplied by the BLM.  These will be placed inside the adit or shaft and then the remaining open areas around the bat gate will be sealed off with solidifying foam and finished with waste rock available on site.  The contractor will be responsible for picking up the bat gate culverts from the Boise District ware yard and transporting them to the work site.  Contractor is responsible for transporting all materials to the project locations. 
The attachment is available by contacting Patricia A. Fort at (208) 373-3910 or email at patricia_fort@blm.gov. ADIT AND SHAFT CLOSURE WORK FY08Location, Safety Concerns, and Remediation Actions 
AML Site 1 -  Roadside Prospect  JV-62 
Location - T 6 S, R 1 W, Sec. 11: SWSW.  Site 1 UTM 546299 Easting, 4751082 Northing.  Site 2 UTM 546266 Easting, 4750921 Northing.  On the Antelope Springs quad.
The prospects in section 10 are along both sides of the Oreana-Castle Creek road.  The others are at the end of a jeep road that diverges from the Oreana-Castle Creek road in the north part of section 11 near the old corral noted on the topographic map.  All of the features are on BLM land.
Safety - Both shafts are hazardous, although boards and timbers in the first shaft fill most of the opening.  The second shaft is a fairly significant hazard because of its abrupt drop-off and lack of warning signs or fences.  
Actions - Two open shafts - Install a 36" diameter bat gate culvert into the opening of each shaft.
AML Site 2 - Unnamed Prospect JV-79 
Location - T 7 S, R 1 E, Sec. 23: SENW.  UTM 556885 Easting, 4739308 Northing.  On the Rough Mountain quad.
It is about 4 miles west of the Poison Creek Cutoff road on an old jeep trail.  The site is shown on the topographic map by a shaft, an adit, and several prospect symbols.
Safety - The open shaft is a significant hazard, as is the internal shaft inside adit 3.  Adit 2, although open, is relatively short.
Actions - Open shaft - Install a 36" diameter bat gate culvert into the shaft.  Open adit 3 - Install a 36: diameter bat gate culvert in the adit.
AML Site 3 -  Unnamed Prospect (Site No. K7249901)
Location - T. 5 S., R. 3 W., Sec. 9, NWNW (this prospect is about 500-600 feet NW of the east communication tower).  UTM 523939 Easting, 4761748 Northing.
Safety - The open shaft or stope is difficult to see, even from a short distance.  Sage and wildflowers grow to the edge of the vertical walls.  With a depth of at least 20 feet, this opening poses a significant hazard.  The open shaft is about 6 feet long and 4 feet wide at the pinch point.  The shaft is easily accessible from the top of War Eagle Mountain.
Actions - Open shaft - Install a 36" diameter bat gate culvert into the shaft opening. Castle Creek and War Eagle Mountain AML Remediation - Information Requested of Offerors

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The StoneGate Firewall has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

Solicitation Number NAAN7944-8-37793 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 512110. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aquaculture Program Office (APO) requires film, video and photo production services focused on natural resource management. The NOAA Aquaculture Program is seeking the production of a range of video-related public outreach and communications products. The purpose of the video products is to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant information to audiences regarding marine aquaculture and to increase public awareness and understanding of the role of marine aquaculture in the United States. Aquaculture, also known as fish and shellfish farming, is a critical component of the U.S. seafood supply. The video productions would be a cohesive collection of long and short video pieces and other products that would be used to help educate the public on the value and importance of domestic aquaculture production as a complement the nation's wild fisheries. The products would also highlight the far-reaching uses of aquaculture techniques in everything from commercial salmon hatcheries to enhancement of recreational fisheries to endangered species restoration. Each video completed as part of this overall project must tell a concise story and convey a message that makes sense to the average high school student. Topics will include newsworthy events, scientific and technological breakthroughs; the relationship of aquaculture to fishing; descriptions of techniques used to farm various marine aquaculture species; myths and misperceptions of aquaculture; the benefits and challenges associated with aquaculture; and other topics as approved by NOAA. All of the deliverables under this contract will require the contractor to take direction from and work closely with program staff on each project described below. The contractor must also use cost efficient production techniques and approaches to ensure that as much work as possible is transferable to other projects in this contract (i.e., the video captured for the full length production can also be used in the b-roll and streaming videos). The contractor must also demonstrate recent experience in completing projects similar to the deliverables listed below within budget and on time. The resulting purchase order shall be awarded on a best value basis and negotiated on a firm fixed price. Period of Performance: September 2, 2008 to September 30, 2010.

<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (NOV 2007) with addenda as follows:</p>
<p>The vendor shall submit their quote in two (2) sections: Technical Solution and Price. The two sections shall be submitted electronically to Melissa R. Sampson at melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov. <br /><br />Vendors are required to submit a Technical Solution which will be used to assess the vendor's capability to perform the requirements shown above. The solution shall clearly demonstrate that the vendor has a thorough understanding of the effort called for herein.</p>
<p>Vendors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the solution; as such, solutions must be fully self-sufficient and provide all necessary information for a comprehensive evaluation. Solutions must be sufficient to show how the vendor proposes to accomplish the effort described above.</p>
<p>The following sections of material shall be submitted: <br /><br />Section I - Technical Solution</p>
<p>Technical Solution -shall include all information required for evaluation, excluding any reference to price. The technical section shall be subdivided into the following factors:</p>
<p>Technical Approach<br />Past Performance</p>
<p>Section II - Price Quote</p>
<p>Price Quote</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach</p>
<p>Vendors should clearly describe their understanding of what is required under this RFQ. The technical approach should address requirements in sufficient detail to determine the Vendor's understanding of the requirements described above. If subcontractors are proposed the technical approach should include a discussion of how they will be utilized so as to explain any possible impacts on performance. The vendor shall submit information in any format the vendor deems relevant for the NOAA to understand and evaluate the following areas:</p>
<p>a. Describe in detail the radar system being offered as to clearly demonstrate that the offered product meets the salient characteristics identified above and that the offered systems meet U.S. Coast Guard Type approval and IMO and IEC requirements.</p>
<p>b. Describe in detail the radar installation inspection and commissioning process that will take place during sea trials.</p>
<p>c. Provide a brochure/product literature of the system being offered.</p>
<p>B. Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors shall describe relevant performance on other contracts or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. List a minimum of three (3) current/previous contracts similar in size, content, and complexity to the effort of this RFQ. The Government is looking for past performance involving successful use of the radar system offered. Information shall include: contract number, name and address of the Government agency or commercial entity, point of contact with current phone number, date of contract award, and period of performance, and initial and current contract value. The requested past performance shall not be older than 5 years. The Government reserves the right to contact any government and private source in addition to those included with the quote.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide pricing information in a table format.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212 -2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) <br />This clause has been tailored to this procurement:</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for Items 0001-0005 including the optional items 0001A -0005A.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible vendor whose offer conforming to the Request for Quote will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award without discussion. The determination of greatest value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the technical factors with the differences in the prices proposed. The technical evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve only slightly superior performance capability. The Government will make this assessment through the development of trade-off analyses that involve the assessment of benefits of superior performance capability versus any added costs. As non-price factors approach equality, price as an evaluation factor becomes increasingly more important. The degree of equality between vendor's proposals will be measured by the quantity, significance, and applicability of the superior features offered.<br /><br />The quote shall be evaluated on the criteria listed below:</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>The technical factors, listed in descending order of importance, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>A. TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-1 above, quotes will be evaluated on the information contained in the technical approach that demonstrates the degree of understanding by the vendor of the requirements. Of particular importance, regarding evaluation is how the vendor addresses the areas identified in the Instructions to Offerors, paragraph a-c.</p>
<p>B. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>In accordance with the "Instructions to Offerors" above, quotes will be evaluated on the vendor's demonstrated relevant past performance or affirmative statement that it possesses no relevant or no past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts (within the past 5 years) that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in the solicitation. This information will be used to assess the contractor's past performance history.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>While the price is not the most important evaluation factor, its importance in this procurement will not be overlooked. The degree of its importance will increase commensurately with the degree of equality among technical solutions.</p>

5.0 SOURCE SELECTION FACTORS/CRITERIA
The Government will award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive and responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  
This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), i.e., an offer will be selected based on the best combination of Protection of TSA User Identification Credentials, Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Price. Best Value is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis among price and technical factors.  While the Government evaluation team will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract(s) on the basis of the initial offers received without discussion. A quote should contain the Offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government may award a contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or to the Offeror with the highest technical rating.  Quotes that do not conform to all requirements in this solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion.  Quotes that fail to address essential requirements of the solicitation will not be considered for award.  Quotes that are so deficient as to be not considered for award are not eligible for further consideration.  

Evaluation Factors and Their Relative Order of Importance:

I.	Evaluation Factors 

The Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest price Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest non-price rating.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  The Evaluation Factors for this award are:

A.	Factor 1.	Protection of TSA User Identification Credentials
B.	Factor 2.	Technical Approach 
C.	Factor 3.	Past Performance 
D.	Factor 4. 	Price

 



II.      Weighting of the Factors 

One award will be made based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors.  The non-price factors (Protection of TSA User Identification Credentials, Technical Approach, and Past Performance) are ranked in descending order of importance and are collectively more important than the Price Factor.  As quotes become more equal in their non-price factors, the price factor will become equal to the combined non-price factors.  Offerors must demonstrate their ability to meet all requirements of the Specifications.  Any factors or factor evaluated as unacceptable will render the quote non-responsive.

The following three (3) technical evaluation factors are listed in order of importance:

	Protection of TSA User Identification Credentials
	Technical Approach
	Past Performance

III.      Ratings.

	A.	For Factor 1 (Protection of TSA User Identification Credentials) and Factor 2 (Technical Approach), the Government will use the following Adjectival ratings:

EXCEPTIONAL; GOOD; ACCEPTABLE; and UNACCEPTABLE.

	B. For Factor 3 (Past Performance) the Government will use the following Adjectival ratings:

ACCEPTABLE; NEUTRAL; and UNACCEPTABLE.

              C.	    Factor 4 (Price) will not be given a rating, however, the Government will evaluate the quote using price analysis to determine if the prices are fair, reasonable and realistic.  Unrealistically low or high proposed prices may be ground for eliminating a quote from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.  The Government will evaluate realism by assessing how well the price tracks to the offerors technical quote.

Quotes will be evaluated by adding the option items to the basic items to be awarded.  Evaluation of the option items does not obligate the Government to exercise the option.

The burden of providing complete information rests with the Offeror.  Responses must be thorough and provide enough depth of information for the Government to evaluate adequately. 

III.      Evaluation Factors Defined.

	I	Protection of Transportation Security Administration User Identification Credentials:  The Offeror shall be evaluated in their demonstrated ability to protect TSAs user identification credentials.  
II	Technical Approach: The technical approach should demonstrate the Offerors ability to meet the requirements of the Specification, to include the following:

(a)	Understanding of the requirement
(b)	Quality and proven success of leadership development courses
(c)	Delivery format
(d)	Content of leadership courses in relations to TSA leadership competencies and Office of Personnel Management Cores Executive Qualifications
(e)	Compatibility with TSAs Learning Management System (i.e., Online Learning Center)   
(f)	Type of course proposed (web-based preferred)
(g)	Customer Support (supporting the day-to-day needs of the system/user).  The Experience and qualifications of the Support. 

The Quality and Soundness of the following shall be evaluated within the Technical Approach:

(h)	Supplemental Learning Guide
(i)	Student Launch Kit
(j)	Administrator Kit
(k)	Measurement and Reporting Tools

III.	  Past Performance: Past performance information should include demonstrated successful past performance to include prior experience with the federal government, private sector, and/or the public sector.  A description of past and current contracts should be provided, citing work as closely related as possible to the current effort.  The evaluation will take into account the firms management and technical performance functions of contract execution; customer service; the utilization of accepted practices; and the utilization and management of subcontractors, if any.  Contractors are required to provide three references with a brief description of previous projects of similar size and complexity. The Government will evaluate the vendors response based on the following information:
	Relevancy and complexity of projects in relation to the requirements 
	Assessment of project performance and ability to meet requirements
IV.	Price
	Price proposed based on the technical approach required to fulfill the SOW requirements

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

(c) Special rules.     The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

The items to be procured under this solicitation are obtainable only from the French original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors of the manufacturers.  The OEMs own the proprietary rights to the drawings and specifications needed to manufacture these items.
 (6) Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  A solicitation for this requirement will be submitted to FedBizOpps for potential offerors.   If any responses are received as a result of this solicitation, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors.
(7) Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. - It is the Contracting Officers opinion that prices ultimately negotiated for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical pricing, comparison to market prices for similar items, published price lists and the Government estimate.
(8) Description of the market research. - Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the HH65 components and spare parts.  The item to be procured meets the commercial item definition.  
(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, i.e., proprietary data packages, etc. - Since the United States Coast Guard did not purchase the technical data rights as part of the original acquisition for the HH65 aircraft and the necessary manufacturing drawings, data, and special tooling are proprietary and available only to the foreign original equipment manufacturer.   The Coast Guard inquires, on an annual basis, the availability of this information and, as stated in Eurocopters letter of 30 April 2008, American Eurocopter, LLC is the only approved source of supply for Eurocopter products for the HH65 aircraft.  We are the only authorized source to sell these parts in North America.  Eurocopter will not release their drawings or data rights to anyone for the purpose of reverse engineering and will not copy the drawings for someone to duplicate the Eurocopter design and remanufacture under a different part number. 
(10) Listing of the sources, if any that expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for these items will be submitted to FEBizOpps (copy attached).
(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  Complete specifications and drawings for the HH65 are not available to the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard does not possess technical expertise nor were the data rights to spares purchased as part of the initial system acquisition for the HH65 aircraft.  As the Aircraft Inventory Control Point (AICP), ARSC is tasked with supporting systems that have been deployed for use in the aviation community.  However, in an effort to increase competition among affiliates and distributors, HH65 Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows, extensive Internet database research is conducted and procurements are advertised in FedBizOps.  In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, ARSC established the New Product Development Branch (NPD) and a representative of the NPD Branch is assigned to the HH-65 Product Line.  This representative has the responsibility to locate alternate sources of supply/services and alternate acceptable products.  Engineering, contracting and New Product Development representatives continuously conduct market research to ensure that companies interested in doing business with the USCG are given every opportunity to compete for our requirements.
(12) Certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officers knowledge and belief.  I hereby certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful and a failed transition.

OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change -- wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society, development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation, identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs, and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region. In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region. The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. 

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages a program called the FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc. In addition, the program is undertaking media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

The purpose of this contract is to fund a Field Program Manager to support USAID/OTIs FATA Transition Initiative in Pakistan. The Field Program Manager holds a management position primarily responsible for coordinating monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of activities within the overall FTI program. The Field Program Manager position will be responsible for the training and management of the FTI programs monitoring, evaluation and reporting staff and resources and will advise the FTI program on the conceptualization, design and implementation modalities necessary to deploy such in a complex, non-permissive, and highly sensitive political environment. The Field Program Manager should be prepared to direct, manage and personally supervise the work of the individuals and organizations under his/her authority without the benefit of directly visiting FTI grant activity sites within Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  

The position is a tandem/ladder position. Applicants may submit applications for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each. Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-13 position may not be accepted for a GS-12 position/grade level). If hired at the GS-12 equivalent level, the selected employee may be eligible for promotion to the GS-13 equivalent level. Promotion to the GS-13 level is not guaranteed, and may only occur after working a minimum of 12 months at the GS-12 level, and after receiving a recommendation for promotion by the supervisor as part of an excellent performance evaluation.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Pakistan program.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Field Program Manager will work closely with OTI implementing partner organizations in the management of relevant program monitoring, evaluation and reporting resources to devise strategies meant to interpret and use information for the general benefit of improving the tactical, programmatic and strategic impact of FTI. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate problem-solving skills and the ability to implement creative approaches at monitoring and evaluating the FTI programs activities in order to advise the OTI Country Representative and other members of the Senior Management Team of ways to improve the programs activities and modalities.  Due to the rest and recuperation (R&R) schedule, the Field Program Manager can expect to periodically assume, in addition to his/her own duties, the responsibilities of one or both the OTI Deputy Country Representative and the OTI Country Representative. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate professional maturity and ability to effectively represent OTI to the high volume of delegations consistently visiting Pakistan. The Field Program Manager must also demonstrate personal maturity given the pervasive proximity of peers and supervisors in both professional and social settings at all hours of the day.  Because of the likeliness of changes in program direction and implementation, the Field Program Manager must be a highly flexible individual capable of redesigning his/her roles and responsibilities. 

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

The Field Program Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Middle East Regional Team and will be based in Peshawar, Pakistan. Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The support requirements are complex and demanding: schedules change daily; note takers must be provided for each meeting and immediately available in case of scheduling changes.  Because of the limited number of rooms available at the Waldorf-Astoria, EUR requires additional accommodations.  It is imperative that EUR staff are accommodated nearby, and that the hotel be able to provide, insofar as possible, flexibility in scheduling.<BR><BR>There is a continuing requirement for additional rooms beyond those immediately available on-site at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in order to adequately support the numerous meetings with European and Eurasian leaders to be held by the Secretary, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and other senior leadership.

It is imperative that EUR staff are accommodated nearby, and that the hotel be able to provide, insofar as possible, flexibility in scheduling.<BR><BR>There is a continuing requirement for additional rooms beyond those immediately available on-site at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in order to adequately support the numerous meetings with European and Eurasian leaders to be held by the Secretary, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the Assistant Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and other senior leadership. With four of the working staff staying in New York long term we would also like to request a refrigerator inside four of the rooms.<BR><BR>New York City, New York. ***Hotel should be within  mile of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel***<BR><BR>September 19, 2008 to October 3, 2008<BR><BR>Upon conclusion of the conference, the hotel shall submit a single invoice to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for the following: Lodging<BR><BR>The hotel shall ensure standard security for all participants (room safes for valuables and laptops).<BR><BR>QUESTION: I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THESE ROOMS ARE SINGLES AND WOULD THEY QUALIFY FOR THE GOVERNMENT RATE? Answer: We are aware that Government per diem during that time is impossible.  Yes they are singles, however four of them should have kitchenettes/refrigerators.
QUESTION: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE WALDORF, SAY, WITHIN A MILE?Answer: The hotel should be  mile to the Waldorf-Astoria.
QUESTION:WHAT IS THE BILLING PROCESS?Answer: Invoicing instructions will be provided on the order. Generally, the hotel invoices Department of State and we pay within 30 days of receiving a proper invoice.
QUESTION: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HOTEL RATING OR PRICE RANGE WE'RE LOOKING AT? DO I CHECK DAYS INN (130.00) OR MARRIOTT MARQUIS?(550.00) Answer: We prefer hotels along the lines of Marriott Marquis.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this effort is to establish agreements in accordance with FAR 16.7 to ensure the United States Department of State&rsquo;s Foreign Service Institute (FSI)  establishes and maintains qualified alternative sources available for FSI training, seminars, instruction etc for the following topic areas:
&bull;	Job Counselors for Retiring and Transitioning employees
	
The agreements solicited are for commercial services or items and is open to all vendors who are registered to do business with the federal government.  This is not a small business set aside as total awards are expected to exceed $100,000 over the life of the agreement.
FSI has unique requirements for contractor support and this is a CONTINUOUS solicitation but has defined proposal submission cut off dates.  Approximately every 6 months, FSI will reopen this solicitation and establish a new proposal due date.  Vendors are encouraged to submit proposals outlining the criteria listed in this solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation factors in section M, and subsequent awards will be made as necessary. It is in the best interest of the government for the prospective respondent vendors to have an understanding of the FSI mission in regards to the need for flexibility and availability of vendor support.  
The current period for proposal submission is from June 25, 2008 through FRIDAY, JULY 18, 2008 at 1:00 PM Eastern.
FSI provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State, the Foreign Service community and other government agencies.   FSI trains Foreign Service Officers (FSO) from all diplomatic posts throughout the world.   Students attend training and classes at FSI which are scheduled and have little, to no room for adjustment.  Students arrive and must be trained during the scheduled times as they must return to post.  Therefore, FSI must ensure trainers, presenters, instructors, etc are available when needed.  Instances occur when a government employee or a contracted vendor is not available to instruct and FSI must find a replacement, as cancelling a course for t his reason is not cost effective for the government.</p>

VENDOR QUESTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS ARE POSTED.  NO MORE QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED FOR THE SOLICITATION ENDING FRIDAY, JULY 18, 2008.  SEE UPLOADED WORD DOCUMENT NAMED "SFSIAQ08R0037-JSP Contract Counselors Q&A 080710.doc".

<p>The following provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (NOV 2007) with addenda as follows:</p>
<p>The vendor shall submit their quote in two (2) sections: Technical Solution and Price. The two sections shall be submitted electronically to Melissa R. Sampson at melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov. <br /><br />Vendors are required to submit a Technical Solution which will be used to assess the vendor's capability to perform the requirements shown above. The solution shall clearly demonstrate that the vendor has a thorough understanding of the effort called for herein.</p>
<p>Vendors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the solution; as such, solutions must be fully self-sufficient and provide all necessary information for a comprehensive evaluation. Solutions must be sufficient to show how the vendor proposes to accomplish the effort described above.</p>
<p>The following sections of material shall be submitted: <br /><br />Section I - Technical Solution</p>
<p>Technical Solution -shall include all information required for evaluation, excluding any reference to price. The technical section shall be subdivided into the following factors:</p>
<p>Technical Approach<br />Past Performance</p>
<p>Section II - Price Quote</p>
<p>Price Quote</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach</p>
<p>Vendors should clearly describe their understanding of what is required under this RFQ. The technical approach should address requirements in sufficient detail to determine the Vendor's understanding of the requirements described above. If subcontractors are proposed the technical approach should include a discussion of how they will be utilized so as to explain any possible impacts on performance. The vendor shall submit information in any format the vendor deems relevant for the NOAA to understand and evaluate the following areas:</p>
<p>a. Describe in detail the radar system being offered as to clearly demonstrate that the offered product meets the salient characteristics identified above and that the offered systems meet U.S. Coast Guard Type approval and IMO and IEC requirements.</p>
<p>b. Describe in detail the radar installation inspection and commissioning process that will take place during sea trials.</p>
<p>c. Provide a brochure/product literature of the system being offered.</p>
<p>B. Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors shall describe relevant performance on other contracts or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. List a minimum of three (3) current/previous contracts similar in size, content, and complexity to the effort of this RFQ. The Government is looking for past performance involving successful use of the radar system offered. Information shall include: contract number, name and address of the Government agency or commercial entity, point of contact with current phone number, date of contract award, and period of performance, and initial and current contract value. The requested past performance shall not be older than 5 years. The Government reserves the right to contact any government and private source in addition to those included with the quote.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide pricing information in a table format.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212 -2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) <br />This clause has been tailored to this procurement:</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for Items 0001-0005 including the optional items 0001A -0005A.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible vendor whose offer conforming to the Request for Quote will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award without discussion. The determination of greatest value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the technical factors with the differences in the prices proposed. The technical evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve only slightly superior performance capability. The Government will make this assessment through the development of trade-off analyses that involve the assessment of benefits of superior performance capability versus any added costs. As non-price factors approach equality, price as an evaluation factor becomes increasingly more important. The degree of equality between vendor's proposals will be measured by the quantity, significance, and applicability of the superior features offered.<br /><br />The quote shall be evaluated on the criteria listed below:</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>The technical factors, listed in descending order of importance, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>A. TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-1 above, quotes will be evaluated on the information contained in the technical approach that demonstrates the degree of understanding by the vendor of the requirements. Of particular importance, regarding evaluation is how the vendor addresses the areas identified in the Instructions to Offerors, paragraph a-c.</p>
<p>B. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>In accordance with the "Instructions to Offerors" above, quotes will be evaluated on the vendor's demonstrated relevant past performance or affirmative statement that it possesses no relevant or no past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts (within the past 5 years) that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in the solicitation. This information will be used to assess the contractor's past performance history.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>While the price is not the most important evaluation factor, its importance in this procurement will not be overlooked. The degree of its importance will increase commensurately with the degree of equality among technical solutions.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers for this requirement, note that the questions and answers have corresponding numbers:Questions:
1.Does the government know in what portion of the IR spectrum this system should operate (i.e., SWIR, MWIR, LWIR)?
2.If a Stirling engine is needed for cooling the FPA -- should that also run on battery?  And if so for how long?  Stirling cryocoolers use up, for examples, about 60 W for 1 W of cooling power.  By the time we add up all other electronics, the power consumption is significant, to require a heavy duty battery (which makes the system less portable).  Along those lines, what would be considered portable? 3. Do the lens need to have zoom capability or just interchangeable?4. What positional accuracy are you trying to achieve from flight?5. What is the mission duration time, ground and flight?
Answers:1. The system shall be able to operate in the Near InfraRed (NIR) or 0.7 - 1.0 microns to the Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR) or 1.0 - 3.0 microns. The Midwave InfraRed (MWIR) or 3-5 microns and the Longwave InfraRed (LWIR) or 5-14 microns is desirable but not required. 
2. All  electronics critical to operation of the instrument are expected to run on battery orother portable power supply. Portability is defined as the unit being able to carried by hand by a single person, or the unit with all its critical operational electronics placed on a small cart or hand truck and manuvered, over short to medium distances (10 -100 meters).  Critical electronics is defined as all systems and subsystems needed for data collection. Subsystems such as computers used for post-processing or analysis of data are not critical if the device can collect data without them. 
3. The changeable lenses are to provide differing Field(s) of View (FOV) for when the instrument is collecting data at or near the ground and when the instrument is airborne. A zoom lens would not be sufficient.
4. Positional accuracy shall have a RMSE of less than 4 meters. 
5. Mission duration time is highly variable. Data collection can range from 5 -10 minutes for a typical aerial data flightline to hours for a ground based data collection. The purpose of this modification is to delete the description "FLIR."  All other terms and conditions shall remain the same. Infrared Imaging SensorThis is a combined solicitation for commercial items exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, although prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following change: (a) change the NAICS Code.  No other changes have been made. 

NAICS CODE:  541712

FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514

TITLE:  Global Response and Synchronization                                                                                            

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-14-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 31 May 2006; FY 07 by 15 Oct 2006; FY 08 by 1 May 2007; and FY 09 by 1 May 2008.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 Oct 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of information discovery and delivery, advanced, multi-constraint and distributed optimization techniques and evaluation models to support mobility operations across a broad set of missions.

The Air Forces Air Mobility Command (AMC) provides global air support for the entire Department of Defense. This includes air support for the President, day-to-day operational support, natural disaster support, humanitarian support, aerial refueling, and warfighter support during operations in hostile environments. Current operations include the planning and execution of over seven hundred (700) sorties per day.  They are hampered by limited support to aircrews, who receive an inadequate near-real time view of the mission and less-than-current information on changes in weather and airport capabilities. Limited connectivity to the aircraft, characterized by only basic voice communications and limited data transmissions, creates problems for the dynamic decision making required in a changing environment. This BAA addresses the need to provide enhancements in information discovery and delivery, advanced, multi-constraint and distributed optimization techniques, timely situation awareness of AMC global activities, enhanced decision aiding and course of action analysis through automation and evaluation models to support mobility operations with special emphasis on increased efficiency and decreased routine workload across functional and supervisory positions.  The requirement is for open-architected, scalable, and government-owned solutions to these issues and is soliciting white papers for innovative technologies to support command and control applications that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that will support and improve legacy and new military electronic systems operations. Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate and demonstrate system technologies.  The developed capabilities may be transitioned to AMC programs, for example Global Decision Support System (GDSS) 2, and US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) programs.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $40K; FY 07 - $8.95M; FY 08 - $8.25M; and FY09 - $7.26M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $40,000 to $1,200,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

2.  COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovation of the proposed technology, the technical approach, and the operational relevance of the problem solution to address current and future Air Force net-centric requirements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates intellect, technical expertise, and domain knowledge, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which open architecture standards and technologies are leveraged, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

    Elizabeth Kean
    Telephone:  (315) 330-2601

The size standard remains unchanged at 1,000 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is canceling this procurement (ED-08-R-0047) in its entirety.  Since the release of the procurement the Departments knowledge base and requirements have changed significantly affecting what is required in an adult learner portal.  Therefore, the Department is eliminating its reliance on the feasibility study referenced in the current statement of work and exploring what additional requirements would be necessary in a new statement of work in the event the Department issues a new solicitation.  In addition, the Department is exploring whether it needs the requirement to manage and maintain the webportal at all, or can find one or more partners willing and capable of completely taking over the adult learner webportal by  participating in a partnership with the Department with the partner bearing the costs of the effort.  

At the present time the Department intends to issue an extension to Contract 
No. ED05CO0062, not to exceed ninety (90) days from September 30, 2008 to:
  Collect and report to the Department any information on usage and usability of the webportal that would be valuable for future decision-making.
  Undertake any activities necessary to conclude re-purposing and continued usage of instructional materials. 
  Make any adjustments/corrections resulting from testing and initial implementation.
  Maintain the operation of the website throughout the period of performance.
  Submit a final version of the Feasibility Study. 
  Undertake any other activities in direct support of implementing USALearns website.
  Undertake activities necessary to transition the webportal to any potential partner. 
  Provide the Department time to reach a decision on how to best utilize the webportal. 
The Department's goal remains to support facilitating adult literacy teaching and learning.
End of cancellation notice.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for Solicitation Number BBGCON6102008-WG (05272008-WG):

Q1.  This contract appears to be indefinite deliver/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), yet the technical response is calling for an estimated time schedule for complete. Can you please clarify this?

A1.  The contract is indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, meaning that we don't know exactly how many of any given class we will purchase or when they will be presented; this decision will be based on the agency need for specific courses at a given time and budget constraints. The estimated time schedule refers to having the vendor provide an estimated time schedule for completing the course content for the Agency to review/approve.

Q2.  The RFP refers to potential trainees/participants as international broadcasters. Does this mean they are non-native speakers of English, i.e., English is a second language? If so, are they fluent or does fluency vary?

A2. This agency broadcasts in 45 languages.  Foreign language broadcasters are required to have native fluency in their broadcast language; therefore, many of the broadcasters will be "non-native speakers of English".  All employees are required to speak English; however, the level of fluency will vary.  Classes will only be taught in English.

Q3.  Since there are no definite requirements in the RFP, can we assume that you want to see firm fixed pricing for labor, materials, events, etc and that these unit prices will then form the basis for customizing price proposals on each project/task order?

A3. Firm-Fixed Pricing to include labor, material, travel, etc.  Course development costs aside, we should have a class price schedule to work from that lists a single cost for each iteration of each of the classroom courses and the one - on -on sessions.

Q4.  Are travel expenses reimbursable as a line item or must they be built into the firm price? 

A4.  Travel expenses are not reimbursable and should not be a separate line item; travel must be included as part of the firm fixed pricing.

Q5.  Are you contemplating a multiple award for this RFP and if so, how will the contract be apportioned?

A5.  We are not contemplating a multiple award for this RFP.

Q6.  How many copies of the proposal are required and must it be mailed in?

A6.  An original and two (2) copies.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled DRAFT STAND ALONE MISSIONS OFOPPORTUNITY NOTICE ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY which was posted on March 13, 2008. Subject: Draft Standard AO is available for commentDRAFT STANDARD ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PI-LED MISSIONSThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issues this DRAFT StandardPI-led Mission Announcement of Opportunity (AO) to solicit community comments.This DRAFT Standard PI-led Mission AO represents a restructuring of previous NASA AOs forPI-led missions (e.g., 2006 Discovery Program AO, 2006 Mars Scout Program AO, 2007 SmallExplorer Program AO). It is the product of an effort by NASA (the AO SimplificationTeam) to simplify and remove burden from the community in generating Step 1 proposalsthat respond to AOs. The AO Simplification effort has solicited comments from theproposing, evaluating, and implementing communities. There have been several communityannouncements, town halls at science conferences, and community workshops to discuss thepros and cons of AO Simplification and specific ideas with the community. The AOSimplification Team has received over 700 specific suggestions from the community and hasconsidered all of them. A White Paper has been developed by the AO Simplification Teamthat captures the rationale for many of the decisions that were made in writing the DRAFTStandard PI-led Mission AO. That White Paper will be posted on the same NSPIRES websiteas this DRAFT AO.It is NASAs intent that this AO clearly and unambiguously states the policies thatgovern the solicitation, selection, and implementation of PI-led mission investigationssolicited by NASA for any of its PI-led mission programs (including New Frontiers,Discovery, Mars Scout, Explorer, Earth System Science Explorers (ESSP)). This AOstandardizes the language and policies, to the maximum extent possible, that NASA uses inits PI-led mission AOs. To simplify the nature of the response necessary, this AO clearlyand unambiguously states and numbers the requirements that all proposals shall meet inorder to represent a compliant response to this AO.

Q2.   What is the specific requirement for personnel supporting CENTCOM and SOCOM?  The SOW is silent on the specific requirement.  

A: 	SOCOM is the only effort we have funded at this time and that contractor will be responsible for supporting all the operational activities for that COCOM.

Q3.   Are IPT/WIPTs established to support specific document development or processes, e.g., Cost Analysis Requirements Description (CARD) development?  

A: 	The GCSS PMO will provide a template and training if needed to create the cost analysis documents.  Bi-monthly IPRs are held to brief the program manager on the progress of the contract.  

 

Q4.   What is the specific IPV6 requirement? 

A:	There is no IPV6 requirement since this contract does not include any software development.

 

Q5.   Regarding task 7.1 Acquisition Documents, of the documents listed, which documents must the contractor develop and is it anticipated the contractor will assume total update and CM responsibilities?

A:	This is a list of all possible documents required for the program.  The contractor will not be required to develop each and every document but should be familiar with all of these documents.  It will be the discretion of the TM as to which documents the contractor will develop.  He/she will not be expected to develop any document in a vacuum.  The PMO has government employees that create these documents.  The contractor will work on and with this team.

 

Q6 (a).   Relative to paragraph 14, Place of Performance, 1) do you anticipate the contractor will need to support personnel at an offsite facility.  

A: 	No.  The contractors are needed on-site: CENTCOM, SOCOM, and Sky 7.

A: 	Yes  One (1) FTE at SOCOM (FUNDED), One (1) FTE at CENTCOM (UNFUNDED) and three (3) FTEs at Sky 7 in Falls Church, VA  (UNFUNDED) for a total of five (5) FTEs.


Q7.        Who is the incumbent and is the government happy with their
service?

A:                 For the CENTCOM/SOCOM effort:  AMTI (an SAIC subsidiary) is the
incumbent.

Q8.        Please clarify proposal due dates:  FEDBIZOPPs calls for written
technical and cost proposals by 2:00 pm on 19 May 08 and the SF 33 calls for
proposals by 12:00pm on 16 May 08.  Which is correct?

A:               The original closing date of the proposal was 19 May 2008, however, see the extended closing date above.

Q9.        On Page 70 of the SOW, 6th paragraph:  The last sentence states:  The offeror shall submit one original signed paper version of the proposal and one electronic copy of the proposal.  Question:  Where should the original signed paper version be delivered?

Q10.      Page 72, para 3.b(2), Understanding the Problem:  Is NETCOP relevant to this contract action or is it an artifact of some other SOW?  This sentence ends on Page 73 with a reference to NETOPS vice NETCOP.


A.                  NETCOP is not relevant to this contract.  This program was written in error; corrections have been made to the solicitation.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.
