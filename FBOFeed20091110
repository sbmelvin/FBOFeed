<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The USDA, Agricultural Research Service intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Replacement of electrical systems in low containment animal facilities Buildings 3 and 4 at the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA.</p>
<p>The ARS has a requirement for construction of the Electrical System Replacement of Buildings 3 and 4 at the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA. These buildings were constructed in the late 1950s and are approximately 50,000 gross square feet each. They each house large species of farm animals used in research programs. They have had some routine Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and finish upgrades performed. The electrical gear and distribution is for the most part original equipment which is difficult to maintain or obtain parts for. <br /><br />The buildings consist of several wings which house animal programs. During this electrical project, the buildings will remain in service with the wings vacated two at a time for the work to proceed. The scope includes re-feeding the buildings from the new campus distribution systems, replacement of the distribution transformers, replacement of main electrical gear, replacement of motor control centers, and replacement of distribution panels, feeder circuits, branch circuits and devices. The distribution transformers, main switchgear and motor control centers shall be installed in new locations to allow the building to remain operational throughout construction. As individual wings are vacated, the branch panels, wiring and devices shall be replaced in the same location. <br />The nature of the facilities requires redundant feed from the campus system and redundant main gear. The campus utilizes 2 sets of feeders and a Power Monitoring and Control System (PMCS) to achieve either automatic or manual transfer between the redundant systems.</p>
<p>The scope also includes the addition of advanced electrical metering for building feeder-level sub-metering, penthouse lighting, egress lighting, animal room lighting control timers, battery back-up for animal room lighting, lightning protection repair, and replacement of outlets in the laboratories, animal rooms and hallways. Work includes data communication in the laboratories, offices and hallways and a fire detection/alarm system.<br /><br />Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs) are prevalent throughout the utility spaces between ceilings and attic floors and in the electrical room flooring. The scope of work will include asbestos removal and/or abatement.<br /><br />BASE ITEM<br />Phase 1 work includes the removal, disposal and replacement of the following in Buildings 3 and 4; switchgear, replacement of motor control centers with branch panels and starters/disconnects, and replacement of 112.5 KVA transformers. Phase 1 includes power and lighting work in the basements and penthouses of Buildings 3 and 4. Phase 1 includes asbestos abatement at the attic of Wing I and selected floor tile in the electrical rooms in Buildings 3 and 4.<br />and<br />Phase 2 work includes the abatement of asbestos at the attics of all other wings and the electrical power and lighting replacement work at the first floor of Buildings 3 and 4. Abatement and electrical work are to be coordinated with each other and with the Government to allow for efficient use of time and materials and installation within the performance periods indicated.<br /><br />OPTIONAL ITEMS<br /><br />OPTIONAL ITEM #1<br />Option 1 work includes the re-feeding of Building 3 with 13.2kv service. This work includes: splicing into current 13.2kv service, construction of manholes, the new service entry complete with ductbank, bus duct, cables and cable terminations, and the removal, disposal and replacement of the existing distribution transformers, cabling and medium voltage switches. Interface with the PMCS is required under this bid option. <br /><br />OPTIONAL ITEM #2<br />Option 2 work includes the re-feeding of Building 4 with 13.2 kv service. This work includes: splicing into current 13.2kv service, construction of manholes, the new service entry complete with ductbank, bus duct, cables and cable terminations, and the removal, disposal and replacement of the existing distribution transformers, cabling and medium voltage switches. Interface with the PMCS is required under this bid option.</p>
<p>OPTIONAL ITEM #3<br />Option 3 work includes furnishing and installing capacitor banks for Buildings 3 and 4.<br /><br />The contract performance time is approximately 560 calendar days (base and all option items) after the issuance of the notice to proceed. The Estimated Cost of Construction (ECC) for the project is between $5 million and $10 million. The NAICS code is 238210 with a size standard of $14 million. This procurement is being issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition utilizing the negotiated method by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP). Bid Bonds are required. Performance and Payment Bonds will be required by the successful offeror. The solicitation documents will be available for viewing and downloading on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about November 25, 2009.</p>
<p>A single pre-proposal conference and site visit has been tentatively scheduled for December 16, 2009, at 1:00 p.m. CST at the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) in Ames, Iowa. Subcontractors are encouraged to attend the pre-proposal conference and provide copies of their business resumes to potential prime contractors for possible subcontracting opportunities. Proposals are due on Friday, January 8, 2010, at the George Washington Carver Center, ATTN; Jennifer Friel, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705-5124. Due to the heightened security at Government buildings, offerors are encouraged to send their proposals via overnight mail. If proposals are sent via regular mail, please allow an additional five (5) days for mail scanning. Couriers will not be allowed to drop proposals off at the security desk; they must take them to the mail room located at the back of the building and therefore must do so in enough time to meet the date and time for receipt of proposals. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for new seal rings, ranging in size from 90" to 207" in diameter. The new seal rings will be installed on various sized hydroelectric Francis type turbines, ranging up to 130 megawatt (178,000 horsepower).  The units typically have running clearances no greater than 0.045" radial between the rotating and stationary seal rings. Past seal ring replacements utilized nickel-aluminum bronze paired against austenitic stainless steels such as CF8/304L. Wear rates observed using these materials were excessive, primarily on the aluminum bronze rings. Nitronic 60 stainless, with excellent mechanical properties, is now being used in place of the aluminum bronze to extend the life of the turbine seal rings and improving the long-term efficiency of the turbines.
The principal components of the work include the following: 
(1) The seal rings shall be fabricated as one piece, seamless and continuous either by centrifugal casting or ring roll forging;  
(2) The seal rings shall be furnished oversized relative to installation - final machining of the seal ring clearance surfaces will be done in the field by Hoover, Parker or Davis Dam staff to assure proper clearances between the rings and runner as well as accurate pre-stressing of the rings during installation; 
(3) Material
A.  All seal rings shall be made of austenitic stainless steel to the following material specifications, unless otherwise specified in the respective task orders:
Centrifugal Castings:  ASTM A743-95, Grade CF10SMnN (Nitronic 60)Forgings:  ASTM A276-97, Grade UNS S21800 (Nitronic 60)
B.   The seal rings shall be delivered in the fully annealed condition to ensure minimal internal stresses and distortion during final machining operations by government personnel. The manufacturers suggested heat treatment procedure information, including intermediate "tempering", furnace type, and controls shall be reviewed by the Government prior to any heat treatment of the material. 
C.  As a minimum, the material shall exhibit the following mechanical properties after final heat treatment:
UTS [ksi]  (> 85)  0.2% YS [ksi]  (> 42)Elongation in 2" [%]  (> 40)Hardness [Bhn]  (< 220)  
Any intermediate tempering of the material shall be subject to ASTM A262-E, "Inter-granular Corrosion Resistance".
(4)  Dimensions and Tolerances  Seal ring dimensions and tolerances will be shown on the drawings.Dimension and tolerance shall be interpreted by ASME specification Y14.5M-1994 - Dimension and Tolerancing, and shall be recorded with material condition in the free-state having no residual forces from fixturing or tooling. This solicitation is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 331513 Steel Foundries (except Investment) with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation, in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP), will be issued on or about December 5, 2009 with offers due on or about January 05, 2010. The RFP will include evaluation factors for equipment, experience, past performance, and price.  
The Government intends to award multiple award Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity contracts with a performance period of five years.  As seal rings are needed, fixed price task orders will be competed between the contractors receiving a contract award.  The estimate magnitude of each task order is between $5,000.00 and $200,000.00.   The minimum order is $ 5,000 with a total contract value estimated $5,000,000.00 for the five year period.  The estimated contract award date is March 19, 2010.  
No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov. The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD if the FedBizOpps (FBO) web site becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register at the FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation, or visit the FBO website after issuance download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Offerors are required to have a current registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on CCR at http://www.ccr.gov.

The Government estimates total cost of the design and construction to be between $200M - $300M. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned is 236220. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award of a Federal contract. This procurement is unrestricted.</p>
<p>The Building 107 project (B.107) consists of the design and construction of a new 294,800 gross square feet (GSF) office building, site utilities and a 729 car parking deck. A service drive and hardscape treatment to provide pedestrian and emergency vehicle access is included in the project in accordance with the Chamblee Campus Master Plan. The project includes approximately 275 linear feet (LF) of utility services containing steam, water, voice/data, and other utilities, which will connect with the existing campus utility tunnel system. This connection will service Buildings 107 &amp; 108; however, Building 107 will be supported by the existing Central Utility Plant (CUP) capacity for steam and chilled water.</p>
<p>The Building 108 project (B.108) consists of the design and construction of a new 285,500 GSF office building, site utilities and a 781 car parking deck. A service drive and hardscape treatment to provide pedestrian and emergency vehicle access is included in the project in accordance with the Chamblee Campus Master Plan. The project includes purchase and installation of equipment including but not limited to a chiller and cooling tower which will be installed in the existing Chamblee Campus CUP to support Building 108. Buildings 107 &amp; 108 will be similar in architectural appearance to the existing Chamblee Campus Building 106. The Parking Decks associated with each building will be combined into one structure for concurrent construction along with on grade parking spaces required for the project.</p>
<p>PHASE I</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 36.303-1, this notice constitutes Phase I solicitation of prospective offerors for this requirement.

Only prospective offerors and their major consultants, having established production offices within a sixty mile radius of the city of Atlanta, Georgia will be considered for this procurement. Selected prospective offerors shall be required to possess the necessary permits, registration and licenses that may be required to carry out all tasks covered under this contract.

Additional information relative to this specific project is not available and requests for it will not be considered. Site visits will not be arranged during Phase I submittal period. All proposals are to reference Solicitation number 2009-N-11460.</p>
<p>PHASE II</p>
<p>During Phase II, a Solicitation will be issued to each prospective offeror within the competitive range also referred to as the short list. Offerors selected to participate in Phase II competition for award of a contract will be notified in writing. Each prospective offeror will be given a copy of the Building 107 &amp; 108 Project Development Studies (PDS) and a tour of the site prior to their interview. Each prospective offeror will also be asked to submit a price and technical proposal for design-build services for the Building 107 &amp; 108 project. The following criteria represent the factors which will be used by CDC's Source Selection Panel for the source selection process:</p>
<p>1. Project Schedule (25 points)<br />2. Site Utilization (15 points)<br />3. Functional Efficiency (15 points)<br />4. Quality of Material and Systems (15 points)<br />5. Energy Conservation (10 points)<br />6. Architectural Image and Character (10 points)<br />7. Price and Subcontracting Plan (10 points)</p>
<p>As a part of the selection process during Phase II, each of the shortlisted teams will also be asked to make a 30-minute presentation. It is important that the Design Build team's key personnel proposed for assignment on the project be present and actively participate during the presentation. Teams are invited to clarify their proposals during the interview and CDC will pose questions to proposed team members.</p>
<p>The Government will make an award to the responsible prospective offerors whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, and offers the best value to the Government with technical factors and price considered. As indicated herein the Source Selection Authority (SSA), will direct the source selection process, including making the final selection based on the best value process. A Source Selection Panel (SSP) will support the SSA by making a recommendation for the best value prospective offeror selection. The proposals will be scored according to the technical evaluation factors and standards outlined in the RFP. The technical proposals will be reviewed by the SSP prior to the SSA's review. After the technical evaluation has been completed, the contract may be awarded on the basis of the initial proposals. However, if the Contracting Officer determines discussions are necessary, offerors will be advised in accordance with FAR 15.306(d)(3) and FAR 15.307, of technical deficiencies and significant weaknesses and will be given an opportunity to clarify and submit a final proposal. Additionally, the Contracting Officer may request minor clarifications to resolve ambiguities or omissions during evaluations without having discussions. Questions concerning this solicitation shall be addressed to Kenneth Ivery, Contracting Officer in writing or may be e-mailed to kivery@cdc.gov. Contract Award will be subject to availability of funds. The project will be incrementally funded which necessitates that cost proposals submitted during Phase II be provided separately for the Design and Construction Phases. Funding is available initially for the Design Phase and all efforts will be made to make a complete award, including the construction phase no later than June 2010. However, due to Congressional funding, this award may be delayed until Government Fiscal Year 2011 third quarter. In order to reduce the possibility of error and to increase the quality of our service to you, all deliveries, packages, etc. must include the name of the Contracting Officer for the particular project. Submit copies [seven (9) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy] of Phase I submittals to: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Buildings and Facilities Contracts Branch, Attn: Kenneth Ivery, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341, Room 2813, Mail Stop K-71.</p>

<DESC>SINGLE PRODUCT JUSTIFICATION FORiTKO LISA Framework License and Virtual Service Emulator (VSE)
1.  Procurement The name of this acquisition is the iTKO Lisa Framework License and Virtual Service Emulator (VSE) , PR# xx-xx-xxxxx.
2.  Program Office and Point of ContactThe requiring organization is AJP-174:  Kelly Mesveskas, 609-485-4174.
3.  Nature of Procurement Action
The nature of this procurement action is to extend our iTKO LISA Framework License to all SWIM Implementing Programs (SIPs) and to acquire a Virtual Service Emulator (VSE) product.  
Today's National Airspace System (NAS) comprises myriad systems developed over time for specific purposes.  Each of these interfaces is custom designed, developed, managed, and maintained individually at a significant cost to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) relies upon a new decision construct that brings more data, systems, customers, and service providers into the process.  Data will be needed at more places, for more purposes, in a timely manner, and in common formats and structures to ensure consistent use.  SWIM changes this paradigm with taking a federated and distributed Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach.  
In changing this architectural approach within the NAS, the traditional testing methodology and tools are in adequate to assure testing in a rapid development, increased agility, information sharing, consolidation, compliance, standard validation and software reuse.  Application development is evolving from mainframe, client/server, and browser-based systems to composite applications based on distributed component-based architecture such as SWIM.  Therefore, custom developed simulators (sometimes multiple) created for development unit testing, DT&E, OT&E, and regression testing are a thing of the past.  
These new composite applications consist of multiple layers of different technologies, tied together by protocols and messaging standards over the Internet. The increase in flexibility gained by being able to integrate so many components is offset by an increase in the potential points of failure where these systems connect.
The different technologies required to be tested in a SOA environment and provided by iTKO LISA Framework out of the box (OOTB) consists of:  	Web interface (HTML, HTTP, AJAX, RIA, Swing, Flash, etc.)	Web Services (SOAP, WSDL, XML)	Integration layers & ESB message buses (IBM MQ, TIBCO, webMethods/SoftwareAG,	SAP XI/PI, Oracle/BEA, Progress Sonic, other JMS providers)	SOA Governance & Management frameworks (UDDI, Registry/Repository, Policy)	Business Process Management (BPM) tools	Java servers & objects (JEE/J2EE, EJB, RMI, POJO, etc.)	Databases (JDBC, SQL, etc.)	File systems	And many other flavors of custom or legacy objects that exist within the enterprise.
The LISA Enterprise Framework Floating License enables the SWIM program to provide each of the SWIM Implementing Programs (SIPs) with a license to provide a consistent and cost effective test environment.   This license enables each SIP to use a common test tool to perform functional testing, interoperability testing, compliance testing, regression testing and performance testing in their respective development environment, test environments and across the various domains.   
The LISA Virtual Server enables a SIP to easily simulate the interaction and data exchange of their service.   This newly created virtual service which emulates the SIP service will then be available to clients, such as other SIPs and NNEW programs, for testing purposes without utilizing the traditional IT resources (lab equipment, lab person, schedule restraints, etc) required for traditional interoperability testing.   All of the floating license will be managed by the SWIM Implementation Team at WJHTC for all SIPs (ERAM, TFM, AIM, CIWS, WMSCR, TDDS, ITWS, etc).   Once a SIP has completed the necessary testing, the license may be transferred or shared with another new program.   

Providing the iTKO LISA Framework and VSE products to each of the SIPs, reduces costs, minimizes risk, and minimizes interoperability and compliancy issues.  
In addition to the SWIM Implementation Team's evaluation and past experience with using the iTKO LISA product, the following FAA organizations have also evaluated this product and feel this is the best SOA Test Tool product. 
	Kenyon Elliott, AJF-A34	Melissa Passmore, AJF-A14	NextGen

4.  Total Estimated ValueLISA Enterprise Framework license and LISA Virtual Server license are available from iTKO on the GSA Schedule from Jackpine Technologies and Immex Technologies.   However, a minimum purchase of 20 licenses must be purchased in order to get the at a higher cost then quote provided directly from iTKO.  Bundling all of the licenses provides a cost effective means for managing, standardizing and ensuring quality across all of the SIPs.  Total cost $359,073.00

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is establishing a Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) and a Northern California and Nevada 8(a) BOA. This solicitation is for the Southern CA & AZ BOA only. NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs. Previous BOA holders must reapply and meet all stated requirements of this announcement. NAVFAC SW plans to advertise the Northern CA & NV BOA on or about 15 Feb 2010. The Northern CA & NV BOA pertains to construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA and Las Vegas, NV). Firms who qualify and have a bona fide office in both a Southern CA or AZ SBA district and a Northern CA or NV SBA district can participate in both the Southern CA & AZ BOA and the Northern CA & NV BOA. Firms will be required to apply for both BOAs separately. The BOA is a five-year (base and 4 one-year options) program in coordination with the Small Business Administration for Developmental Stage 8(a) firms. The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protg firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of January 15, 2010; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA or Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CC! R) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.

<a href="mailto:Honegger.Harold@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 813920   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to support the People, Prosperity, and the Plant (P3) Program design judging competition.  In 1993, AAAS, with support from the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), initiated a project to examine the concept of "competitiveness" as it pertains to research institutions in order to identify strategies and enhance metrics to assess progress towards achieving competitiveness.  Following the success of that effort, AAAS developed plans for a larger project that would go beyond studying the concept of competitiveness and use the resources of the AAAS to offer practical assistance to state EPSCoR programs and their participating institutions and researchers.  In late 1996, AAAS established the Research Competitiveness Program (RCP) to house the expanded project and future related activities.  The AAAS Research Competitiveness Program draws upon the resources of the American science and engineering community to assist institutions in planning, reviewing or evaluating programs and initiatives in research, development, and innovation.  Due to the established mission of the Research Competitiveness Program, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the only institution which can offer such extensive experience in conducting independent peer reviews.  As stated above, EPA intends to award this procurement on a sole source basis.  Notwithstanding, any vendor that believes they are capable of meeting EPA's requirements as stated herein may submit evidence of such capability within 15 days of this posting.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Harold Honegger, at honegger.harold@epa.gov  
BACKGROUND:
Achieving sustainability in the developed and developing worlds requires creative designs for scientific and technical innovations.  Five years ago, EPA launched its P3 competition, a grant program for multidisciplinary teams of college and university students to design solutions to sustainability challenges and for their faculty advisors to use the grant opportunity to infuse sustainability principals into curricula.  EPA's P3 Award competition begins with the receipt of Phase I grants at the start of the academic year. In April, all teams must submit their final reports from Phase I activities as well as their proposals for a Phase II grant i.e., what they would do with additional funding to take the project to testing and implementation.
The teams bring their designs, prototypes, and other exhibition materials to the National Sustainable Design Expo (the Expo) on the National Mall in Washington, DC. A panel of judges convened by an external scientific professional organization evaluates the team's reports, exhibit and presentation, and proposal for the Phase II award.  Based on their evaluations, the panel recommends to EPA at least 12 projects for receipt of the P3 Award (assuming the panel identifies that many projects that merit the P3 Award and additional funding) and Phase II grant funding.  In this pool of recommended projects, to the extent possible, the judges are asked to ensure a distribution of projects across at least four of the six challenge areas and a distribution of projects between those proposed for the developed and developing world.
This statement of work requests contractor support for the judging of EPA's P3 Phase I grantees for the next three years (2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012) for the purpose of recommending twelve teams from which the NCER Center Director will select the P3 Award winners who will also receive Phase II grant awards.
TASK DESCRIPTION:
The contractor shall provide the qualified personnel and staff support necessary to evaluate all the Phase I P3 projects, recommending Phase I P3 projects as P3 Award winners, and providing consolidated judges evaluations for each team. To provide this support, the contractor will perform the following sub tasks: 
1.  Identify a panel of judges who are leaders in the fields of engineering, water science, green chemistry, agriculture, green building design, waste issues, energy issues and/or sustainability to serve on the P3 Award evaluation panel, including providing on-site evaluations, at the Annual National Sustainable Design Expo in the Spring of each year on the National Mall in Washington, DC.  The expertise of the selected judges should be based on the Phase I projects to be evaluated.  
2.  Once an individual agrees to serve as a judge, AAAS will forward their contact information to the EPA Project Officer so EPA can establish contracts with each individual through which the individual can be reimbursed for their review time, travel and expenses associated with serving as a judge on-site at the Expo.
3.  The judges convened will be responsible for evaluation of the scientific quality and technical merit of the applications assigned to them and to provide the Agency with their critiques.  Each judge must provide an independent score reflecting his or her assessment of each application.  The highest score is excellent (E).  Scores range downward as very good (VG), good (G), fair (F), and poor (P).  The scores are defined as follows:
Excellent:  A truly outstanding proposal with numerous exceptional attributes.Very Good:  A very strong proposal with many noteworthy merits.Good:  A solid proposal but not among the best, may have some deficiencies.Fair:  Not a strong proposal.Poor:  A proposal with serious deficiencies.
In addition to scoring the proposals, the judges are requested to indicate strengths and weaknesses of each proposal relative to the evaluation criteria provided in their individual critiques and in the summary evaluation. Particular attention should be paid to the research plan. 
4.  Deliver the Phase 1 P3 final reports and Phase 2 P3 proposals (a combined document for each team), to the judges three (3) weeks prior to the National Sustainable Design Expo.  For 2010, the panel will receive the reports no later than March 30, 2010. The EPA Project Officer will manage delivery of these documents from the P3 teams.
5.  Assign judges to each proposal such that each written proposal is read by a minimum of three judges and each team is visited by a minimum of four judges at the Expo. Among the judges that evaluate each proposal, assign a rapportuer to prepare the final written summary evaluation for each proposal. Each judge will be assigned 16-20 projects to review.  Each judge will provide written evaluations for each proposal they review and each team they visit at the Expo. These written evaluations will be available at the judges' decision meeting and for consultation by the selected rapporteur when he/she prepares the summary evaluation for each team.
6.  On the days of the competition (1) make local transportation arrangements for the judges so they can get where they need to be when they need to be there and (2) manage the process for obtaining and collating written records of the onsite interviews with the student teams, discussions and decision meeting following the interviews, and the preparation of a consolidated evaluation for each team.  A written summary evaluation will be prepared for each team incorporating comments from the review of both the written project report and the team presentation at the Expo that summarizes the individual critiques and the discussion of the application that takes place at the panel meeting.
7.  On the final day of the competition, manage the judge's decision meeting such that 12 teams are recommended to EPA to receive a P3 Award and additional funding, assuming there are twelve teams that the judges feel merit additional funding.  Among these 12 teams, to the extent possible, at least 4 of the 6 challenge areas should be represented and there should be a distribution of projects between those proposed for the developed world and those proposed for the developing world between 40/60 and 60/40.  A numerical ranking of all the teams shall be provided to the EPA Project Officer by 3:00 PM on the last day of the Expo event (for 2010, that will be April 27, 2010).  ORD's National Center for Environmental Research will use this ranking, along with information on available resources, balance of the research portfolio, overall program goals and directions and other criteria or considerations deemed appropriate, to determine which teams will receive the P3 Awards and which teams will receive Honorable Mentions.  Final funding decisions will be made by the NCER Director.
8.  Deliver a written document summarizing the feedback received from the judges and AAAS staff on the judging activities and providing recommendations for improvement of the process and the evaluation criteria.  This will be called the "Feedback Report."
9.  Following delivery of "Feedback Report" described in Task 8, meet with EPA principals to share the AAAS feedback provided on the judging activities and recommendations provided for continued improvements.
10.  Prior to exercising each Option Year, the contractor will work with the Project Officer to develop an appropriate deliverable schedule.
MANAGEMENT CONTROLS
The contractor shall provide status reports to the EPA project officer via email and teleconference as requested/needed.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for Navigation and Timekeeping Technology.

In concert with the guidance promulgated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense National Information Infrastructure (ASD - NII), concerning Navigation Warfare(NAVWAR), which deals with the mitigation of denial of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), this effort is concerned with the first two of the three elements: Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES). Please note that this
effort does not address Electronic Attack (EA).  

Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost. Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations.  For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users. Unfortunately,
the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore there is a need for (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) methods of quantifying threats to GPS performance that may be termed "situational awareness" and (3) affordable and reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.

<DESC>USTRANSCOM/TCAQ anticipates issuing a RFP on or about 27 November 2009 for rail chain tiedown assemblies in support of rail operations.  

This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside competition, lowest cost, firm fixed price contract.

Specification for Chain Tiedown Assembly 

1. Assemblies and their components shall conform to all requirements of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), as of the date of shipment, as found in the current edition of the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, as amended. AAR publications can be ordered by calling toll-free 877-999-8824. 

2. Assemblies shall have a working load limit of not less than 13,750 lbs., a proof test of not less than 27,500 lbs., and a minimum breaking strength of 55,000 lbs. 

3. The Government shall receive certification within 30 days from date of award from a certified independent testing laboratory, confirming that at least three assemblies out of five supplied and tested and otherwise meeting this specification have been proof tested without distorting the chain links and have been tested to the minimum breaking strength without failure (distortion, as contrasted with separation, of chain links at forces beyond the proof test limit will be not be consider failure). The report shall be sent directly from the testing laboratory to the Government (Johnny.Lanctot@ustranscom.mil, address Johnny M. Lanctot, USTRANSCOM TCAQ-S, 508 Scott DR, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5357). The testing laboratory must disclose how many series of five assemblies were tested in order to produce a successful test outcome. If more than one series is tested the testing laboratory must enclosed reports on the failed test series as well. If the testing laboratory furnishes a report on more than one test series, the Contractor shall furnish the Government with a letter detailing what corrective actions, if any, were taken by the Contractor between each test series. The testing and report shall be adequate to meet the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.7.9 requirements for load binder testing and approval. 

4. The assemblies shall include the following components: 
a. A chain anchor device which shall interface with the standard flat car tiedown anchor channel by matching four pairs of projections on the anchor with corresponding notches in the anchor channel. The four pairs of projections and notches are necessary to engage enough of the anchor channel to achieve a strength matching that of the chain tiedown assembly. The design and dimensions of the anchor shall permit the anchor to be inserted into a deep anchor channel design at any point along the anchor channel. The anchor device shall be placed at one extreme end of the assembly. 
b. An acceptable load binder of any type mentioned in the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.7.2, provided that it is permanently attached as an integral component in the assembly. Lever-type binders shall be designed such that when lever handles are released from their locking device the handles are not under live load. Ratchet-type and turnbuckle-type load binders shall be lubricated with persistent grease and equipped with a fitting for adding additional lubrication without disassembly. Ratchet-type and turnbuckle-type load binders need not have an attached handle, provided that they can be tightened with an adjustable or monkey wrench. The load binder shall have a locking device to prevent loosening while in transit. The locking device shall not be a jam nut or other arrangement that loses its effectiveness as a result of wear caused by repeated use. 
c. A compression unit or shock absorber to reduce shocks that would otherwise distort the chain or break a component of the assembly when under load. The compression unit or shock absorber shall be functional at least up to the working load limit. 
d. A means of shortening the chain length of the assembly during attachment to a load sufficient for the load binder to tighten the assembly to the required tension. If the device is to be a hook it shall be a claw hook. 
e. A clevis-type slip hook, with the ability to accept at least a nominal 1.75 shackle body and to interface with all equipment tiedown provisions that meet MIL-STD-209K, to be placed at the extreme end of the assembly 
opposite the chain anchor device. The hook shall not have a locking latch or provision for attaching a locking latch. 
f. Chain with a weight not greater than that of nominal  special alloy chain and marked as required by the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.2 and Table 21.5. 
g. A metal tag stamped with, at minimum, Department of Defense, the name of the manufacturer, the year sold, and the manufacturers part number. 

5. Components shall be attached to each other, and compression units shall be assembled, with AAR-approved coupling or repair links, as found in the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.29.1 and Table 21.3. Compression units shall be assembled with devices that shall permit parts to be replaced without the use of cutting or welding. The components shall be attached to each other so that the assembly, when anchored at one end and hooked to a shackle mounted to a vehicle with its pin in a horizontal plane, shall not exhibit a twisting of the chain or of any other component with respect to the component(s) with which it is joined. 

6. Ferrous components other than the chain must be painted or hot dip galvanized, unless forbidden by AAR specifications for the component. 

7. The overall length of the assembly from the attachment point of the anchor to the attachment point of the slip hook shall be not less than 10 with the load binder at full extension.

This requirement will be restricted to small business only.  The contract will be for a period of date of award to 30 September 2010.  The applicable NAICS code is 332999 All Other Miscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing and the size standard is $18M.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide strategic and technical advisory services to the Sichuan Health Information Center (SHIC) related to establishing a regional healthcare information network.</p>
<p>The objective of the proposed feasibility study is to provide strategic and technical advisory services for the Sichuan Health Information Center (SHIC), the Provincial government body responsible for designing and operating a new generation of e-health facilities and services in Sichuan. The study will formulate a development and service strategy to achieve the goals of SHIC's "Healthy Sichuan" initiative, which are to build a province-wide Electronic Health Record filing system (EHR) by 2020 that will parallel the construction of a Regional Health Information Networks (RHIN).</p>
<p>The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an electronic record of patient health information which includes data related to patient demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports. The EHR makes diagnoses more efficient by automating and streamlining the clinician's workflow. RHIN are intended to establish networks to share data and clinical services among geographically dispersed communities. Together the EHR/RHIN will be an enabler and catalyst for interconnecting the province's health management information systems, public health information systems, medical services information systems, medical insurance information systems, and drug monitoring information systems, to better facilitate the exchange of information. A well structured EHR system will improve the province's comprehensive health management, public health and the efficiency and quality of medical services.</p>
<p>China's healthcare sector is entering a stage of significant growth. ICT platforms, software and professional services are a strategic enabler for the policy to succeed. The successful implementation of EHR/RHIN infrastructure in Sichuan will accelerate the investment of healthcare networks in other regions and encourage the adoption of a national standard. EHR/RHIN is vital, in part, because of pressures on social services created by increased personal mobility within China, as technical medical standards would ensure that healthcare data is portable.</p>
<p>The Consultant, in cooperation with SHIC, shall prepare a detailed project plan, for applications, services and business sustainability for e-healthcare services in the Province. The Consultant shall complete and include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Task 1: Project Kick off: Discussion of overall project strategy, objectives and deliverables, followed by an inception report detailing the project plan. <br />&bull; Task 2: Business Analysis and Strategic Plan: Provide a business analysis and long-term strategy for the implementation of e-healthcare services based on EHR in Sichuan Province. <br />&bull; Task 3: Technology and Operational Assessment: Analyze and assess regional EHR system and formulate the architecture and guidelines for the future of Sichuan health information system and applications. <br />&bull; Task 4: Reference Architecture: Evaluate reference architecture for EHR data center and RHIN to meet application services and investment expectations. <br />&bull; Task 5: Human Resources and Organization: Identify optimal organizational structure and human resource requirements to successfully implement EHR strategy in Sichuan<br />&bull; Task 6: Regulatory analysis: Prepare a review of regulatory issues and discuss any regulations in the host country that would impact the project's viability or prognosis to move forward. <br />&bull; Task 7: Environmental Analysis: Provide a review of the programs anticipated impact on the environment. <br />&bull; Task 8: Developmental impacts: Provide an analysis of development impacts on China related to infrastructure, market oriented reform, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity improvement, etc<br />&bull; Task 10: Final Report and Workshop: A final report summarizing the Consultant's observations, recommendations, technical diagrams and other documentation related to program implementation. Conduct a final workshop presenting the results of the feasibility study as well as recommended future action plans.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $570,642 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>Background: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide specific fee-for service health insurance benefit administration services including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare program (also known as the Medicare fee-for service, or FSS program in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) entitled Part B Railroad Specialty Medicare Administrative Contractor Statement of Work as summarized in the description of work below.
<p>History: As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS has replaced its current claims payment contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers with new contract entities called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). As a result of MMA, CMS designed new MAC jurisdictions to balance the allocation of workloads, promote competition, account for integration of claims processing activities and mitigate the risk to the Medicare program during the transition to the new contractors. Also a part of the MMA was the distinction that the new Railroad Medicare Contractor entity would be called the RRB Specialty MAC</p>
<p>Describe the work: The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Railroad Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, on a Nation-wide basis. The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Railroad Medicare program. The Medicare programs legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the RRB and CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other RRB and CMS partners, Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>

<CONTACT>Darrin P Barber, Phone (412) 386-5239, Email dbarber@cdc.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br /><br />The purpose of this announcement is two-fold. The first purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform this potential requirement. The second purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br /><br />Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is responsible for conducting acquisitions in support of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This potential project is intended to assist NIOSH in fulfilling its mission of eliminating occupational diseases, injuries, and fatalities from the mining workplace through a focused program of research and prevention. As part of its Strategic Goals, NIOSH is to "assist the mining community to maintain and improve mine escape, rescue, and emergency response capabilities through realistic training exercises and the development and implementation of new or improved training aids and exploration, rescue, and escape technologies."<br /><br />Purpose and Objectives: NIOSH plans to create a Mine Rescue and Escape Training Laboratory in Pittsburgh, PA which includes a two-part virtual reality system. One component will be a 360 degree stereoscopic immersive environment appropriate for group training situations and the other will be a large curved screen display appropriate for 3D visualization and display of 2D content. The trainee audiences are mine rescue team members and the general workforce of underground coal mines in the United States.<br /><br />Project Requirements: The Government seeks to purchase a turnkey solution which will include procurement and installation of hardware and related software and training on use of the system. Demonstration software for system training and for demonstration of system capabilities must be included. Four training modules for use with the system are also required. The training is to be set in a virtual environment which includes an underground coal mine longwall panel and a development section.<br /><br />The immersive environment must be large enough for simultaneous training and observation of a full mine rescue team with 3 other individuals playing the role of "victims" during the session. The projection screen must be 360 degrees and tall enough to give the illusion of wrapping overhead of the trainees. The proposed installation site is approximately 43 feet by 46 feet with a height of approximately 18 feet. Suggested screen dimensions are approximately 10 meters (32.8 feet) in diameter by 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The image projected must be seamless. The projection system must allow the display of both 3D and 2D content. Methods for trainee interaction with the virtual environment and for capturing trainee responses during training are required. The potential for adding motion tracking capabilities to the system in the future is desired. Surround sound audio capabilities must be included.<br /><br />The curved screen will be used for projecting training modules, such as those related to hazard recognition or equipment maintenance, and geological or engineering data sets. It should not rely on head tracking for point of view. The display should have the capability to provide one seamless image. A method for displaying traditional content, such as slides and video, should also be provided. Surround sound audio capabilities must be included. The proposed installation site is approximately 9.1 meters (29.9 feet) wide with a floor to ceiling height of 3.4 meters (11.2 feet). Maximum screen size within those dimensions is preferred.<br /><br />Software providing a training environment which includes longwall panel and a development section in a virtual underground coal mine is required. Four training modules to be set in the "virtual mine" should be appropriate for use during federally mandated underground coal mine training sessions. Two modules should be simulations similar in content and length to mine rescue problems which are conducted during mine rescue contests. Two modules should be simulations for general miners covering knowledge and skills needed for successful emergency mine evacuations. Module content outlines will be provided by NIOSH. Interactive elements and a method for capturing trainee responses are required. The four modules will be used for research and demonstration purposes by NIOSH staff. Ability for NIOSH researchers to make future modifications to the software is desired.<br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance: A system is to be installed and fully operational with 2 training modules at the NIOSH site within 6 months after the award of a contract. The final 2 modules must be complete within 9 months after award of a contract.<br /><br />Other Important Considerations: This project is currently contingent upon approval of facility modifications and commitment of funding.<br /><br />Capability Statement / Information Sought: A capability statement should be submitted in response to this notice. In order to ensure full consideration by the Government, the submission should include the following -<br /><br />(1) Respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact (with telephone number and email address), and size and type of business (e.g., large, small, HUBZone, SDVO, 8(a), veteran-owned, woman-owned, or SDB) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code elsewhere identified in this notice.<br /><br />(2) Respondents' opinions about the difficulty and/or feasibility of the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace, and information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.<br /><br />(3) Respondents' information in regard to; (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.<br /><br />Any information provided by the Respondent but not requested by the Government under this notice, such as a Respondents' rough order of magnitude of cost or time required for the project, would be used for planning purposes only. Detailed estimates are not requested nor desired.<br /><br />Information Submission Instructions: To ensure consideration under this notice, submissions should -<br /><br />* Be submitted by email attachment (in PDF format only) to the Contracting Officer's email address provided elsewhere in this notice by not later than the response date also provided elsewhere in this notice.<br /><br />* Be organized in the order outlined in the submission content instructions (1-3e above)<br /><br />* Be limited to 10 pages (including any reference pages)<br /><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.<br /><br />It is the responsibility of interested parties to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this notice at the FedBizOpps Internet site.<br /><br />To enhance the potential list of targets for potential collaboration, this notice provides for vendors to indicate interest and also review a listing of interested vendors within the FedBizOpps Internet site. This "interested vendor" designation is managed (added or removed) at the sole discretion of the vendor.<br /><br />Confidentiality: NO proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice. This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) requires services to support the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) operations. These services include assistance responding to discovery requests, FOIA requests, requests for records from the Congressional Oversight Panel, Congressional Committees having oversight jurisdiction, and similar requestors.

<p>The requirement includes the following types of activities:</p>
<p>&bull; Examine case files to determine issues related to sufficiency of evidence and prepare documentation to support FOIA requests; <br />&bull; Prepare administrative documentation for active case files; <br />&bull; Apply legal precedents involving active case files; and <br />&bull; Examine and evaluate information in case files, for case litigation worthiness and appropriate legal citations.</p>
<p>Interested contractors should be familiar with processing procedures and laws pertaining to FOIA and have demonstrated experience in the field.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential interest and capabilities and qualifications of prospective offerors for this requirement. Treasury is particularly interested in understanding the capabilities and qualifications of interested small business concerns, including woman and minority-owned small businesses, and services-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to provide a written response to this notice which shall be limited to three pages. The response should include the following:</p>
<p>1. Vendor's name and address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address;</p>
<p>2. Vendor's small business size status, including whether the vendor is a woman-owned, minority-owned, hubzone or SDVOSB;</p>
<p>3. Whether the vendor is interested in working as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, or anticipates significant teaming arrangements; and</p>
<p>4. A description of the vendor's capabilities to meet some or all of the required services.</p>

<DESC>PRE-QUALIFICATION NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS

This notice serves as public announcement that United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking to pre-qualify sources for participation in future competitive acquisitions for selection of contractors to provide, operate and manage Mail Transport Equipment Service Centers (MTESC).  Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) is used to transport mail in and between postal processing facilities.  MTE consists of mailbags, various metal containers, plastic and corrugated fiberboard trays and sleeves, canvas hampers, and pallets.  The MTESC functions are to process and repair MTE and return it to service within the postal system.  These sites are designed to provide for the processing and repair of MTE and are part of an established network formed to ensure that adequate, timely, and high quality MTE is available to USPS Processing and Distribution Centers, Bulk Mail Centers and their customers. 

Prequalification is the process of up-front identification of top-quality suppliers able to compete for specific types of contract opportunities. Selection of the right suppliers is critical to the Postal Service's success.  Having the right suppliers augments the Postal Service's ability to deliver high-quality and innovative services to its customers and reduces operational risks.  Pre-qualifying suppliers enhances competition, ensures quality performance, and can also shorten cycle time and strengthen relationships between the Postal Service and its suppliers.  
The USPS intends to pre-qualify an adequate number of suppliers whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or governmental or both) have demonstrated their ability to consistently perform to high standards of quality and reliability.  All qualified suppliers need not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines (1) that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding purchase opportunities for the less qualified. It is the intent of USPS to use this pre-qualified suppliers list for future solicitations for certain MTESC contracts over a 3 year period following the completion of this prequalification.  
Pre-qualification Criteria: The USPS will evaluate a firms pre-qualification submission against each of the Prequalification Evaluation requirements listed in the document titled Prequalification Request/Criteria (Exhibit -1). Interested parties must download the pre-qualification package from FedBizOpps.  Pre-qualification responses will be due by 1:00 PM (EST) March 17, 2009.  All questions and comments regarding any aspect of this notice or the enclosure must be sent by email at the address above or by facsimile at 202-268-8111 by 03/05/09 not later than 1:00 PM (EST).  Pre-qualification does not constitute a contract award.  Any interested firms and incumbent suppliers who have previously been pre-qualified must submit a response to this notice in order to be considered for this prequalification opportunity.  This announcement does not in any way commit the USPS to the reimbursement of any proposal cost or expense, or otherwise create an obligation on the part of the USPS.  The USPS is not obligated to award any contract as a result of this announcement. 

EXHIBITS

1.	Pre-Qualification Request / Criteria
2.	Description of the MTESC operational requirements.
3.	Estimated Volume for each MTESC site.
4.	Estimated Frequency of trips to the customer base in each MTESC location.

(3) The Government would like to have the option to reconfigure, restore or replace existing furniture components. The selected contractor will assist in assessing the condition and reusability of the existing furnishings. (4) The Government would want the ability to trade-in existing furniture for credit. (5) Vendors would be responsible for providing training on all new equipment. (6) The Government would like industry input as to the best way to make this turn-key operation work. (7) The Government would like industry to suggest ways to issue a single task order for a mix of furniture without running up against the barrier of dealer-exclusive relationships.<BR>

<DESC>NOTE:THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
1.0	Introduction:  The Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) program is a single materiel solution for the Multi-Role Radar System (MRRS) and Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) requirements. It is structured as an evolutionary acquisition consisting of four blocks of incremental development and production, referred to as Increments I through IV. Each subsequent increment (II, III, and IV) compliments Increment I with additional capability through software development that leverage the Increment I software application. Each increment builds upon the capabilities of the preceding increments in an additive fashion and will be backward compatible with the previous increments. The acquisition strategy considers Increments II, III, and IV, collectively, as a possible candidate for competitive procurement.
1.1	Purpose:	This RFI is the initiation of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) National Region Contracting Office is issuing this RFI, as part of the G/ATOR program, to assess industry's capability to provide the Increment II, III and IV materiel solution.  The material solution of Increment II, III, and IV shall provide the following capabilities:
Increment II-GWLR:     .?Locating enemy indirect systems and generating artillery target intelligence     .?Locating enemy indirect fire systems and generating fire missions     .?Registering and adjusting friendly artillery and mortars     .?Validating the location of friendly fires     .?Providing target intelligence and information to allow friendly forces to take force                  protection measures while generating fire missions to attack enemy indirect fire             systems
Increment III-Enhanced Air Defense/Surveillance Radar (EAD/SR):     .?Enhancements for Identification-Friend-or-Foe (IFF) incorporation of Modes 5 & S     .?Improved Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities to defeat threat electronic            countermeasures     .?Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) protection capability (Decoys)     .?Sensor-to-Sensor Networking for heightened battlespace awareness     .?Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capability to augment situational         awareness     .??mbedded simulation capability to provide individual training and the generation           of realistic threat profiles for Marine Corps and Joint Service exercises     .??utomated logistics Integrated Data Environment (IDE) capability, to enable         performance monitoring from remote locations via the Internet
Increment IV-Enhanced Air Surveillance Radar (EASR):     .?Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Interoperability     .?Weather Detection     .?Dual Frequency obstruction light     .?Marine Air Traffic Command and Control (C2) Contingency mode
1.2	 Objective:  Data submitted in response to this RFI will be used to assess the marketplace environment for providing the USMC with the material solution for Marine Expeditionary Force (GWLR), EAD/SR, EASR; and secondly to determine the range and depth of Increment I data needed by a potential vendor to successfully develop and produce the Increment II, III and IV capability with no re-design of the Increment I hardware, no basic radar operations software modification or the application of interface devices or middleware.
2.0 Background: 
2.1	Description of Proposed System: G/ATOR consists of three configuration items and software, i.e. the Radar Equipment Group (REG), the Communications Equipment Group (CEG) and the Power Equipment Group (PEG) with a Pallet Assembly.  The REG and its transporter are designed as an integral towed package.  The CEG and PEG are mounted on existing Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) vehicles.  The current configuration utilizes one MK25 Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) and one M1152 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  
Additionally, one Mobile Electric Power (MEP) 806B 60KW generator is provided as GFE. The G/ATOR with GFE vehicles will be employed within the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and tactically moved by driving from one location to another. In addition to tactical movement, the G/ATOR can be configured for transport via MAGTF organic aviation assets such as: C-130 MV-22 and CH-53 or configured for commercial transport via tractor-trailer or rail assets. The software consists of two components; basic radar operations software, common to all increments; and mission software, unique to each of the G/ATOR missions.  The relationship of each of the missions (Increment I, II, III and IV) is provided in Attachment I.
2.2	Increment I Mission:	Increment I supports two distinct mission areas: short-range air defense (SHORAD) and air surveillance Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) Mode. Increment I also provides for growth to all of the following increments with no equipment redesign and includes a computer software architecture that allows for the processors, computer software, and firmware to be upgraded with the functionality of all following increments. The System Design and Development/Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase is currently being performed under contract.
2.3	Increment II Mission:	Increment II provides the GWLR capability and supports the mission area of detecting, tracking, classifying, and accurately determining the origin and impact of enemy projectiles.  Increment II is planned to be a software program onto existing Increment I hardware and provide a lightweight, expeditionary, three-dimensional (3-D), medium/short-range, ground weapons locating radar. It is an expeditionary radar system which will acquire threat indirect fire systems at greater ranges than currently fielded radars and will fully support the MAGTF and Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW).  
2.4	Increment III Mission:  Increment III provides G/ATOR with an EAD/SR capability.  Enhancements include IFF, ARM defense, sensor-to-sensor networking, Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR), and simulation and automated logistics capabilities as key deliverables. Theater Air Missile Defense, Combat Identification, Close Air Support, and Global Information Grid Capstone Requirement Documents identified, examined, quantified, and articulated the need for these enhancements. 
2.5	Increment IV Mission: EASR capability that provides the following enhancements to G/ATOR:.	Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Interoperability .	Weather Detection.	Dual Frequency obstruction light.	Marine Air Traffic Control (MATC) Contingency C2 Mode
The EASR capability is vitally important to the growth of G/ATOR because the baseline radar does not provide all the capabilities required for the future joint force operations. The addition of the EASR will enable Marines to fulfill Joint Operating Concepts and Joint Functional Concepts using a family of G/ATOR radars employed in challenging environments across the range of military operations. 
2.6	Key Notional Events:	Increments II, III and IV mission software will be hosted on the Increment I hardware and system software.  As such, a relationship exists between Increment I events and Increment II, III and IV events.  The key notional events for Increments I, II, III and IV involve delivery of Increment I low-rate production quantities from which subsequent increment software can be loaded to test and refine that particular operational functionality.

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking ideas that may support a new DARPA program to demonstrate innovative concepts and technologies that dramatically increase the Department of Defense's (DoD's) technology for the use of MEMS devices featuring magnetic materials having dimensions from 1 to 1000 micrometers in thickness that can be formed or patterned with a high aspect ratio. It is known that the advantages of electrostatic interaction are dominant at submicron dimensions, but that magnetics have substantial advantages at larger dimensions. To date, no broad effort has successfully exploited magnetic features over the full 3-D size range of 1 to 1000 micrometers. This has limited the miniaturization of inductors, transformers, energy-storage/energy-conversion systems, actuators, motors, sensors, magnetocaloric coolers, and other magnetically enhanced devices.</span><span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The use of novel materials or fabrication techniques at these scales has only been demonstrated at very small production volumes and with poor repeatability.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">DARPA is interested in detailed submissions that provide new ideas on approaches to design, fabricate, and test high-performance thick magnetic MEMS. </span>These magnetic materials must possess the potential to radically change the state-of-the-art with respect to multiple magnetic properties, such as magnetic moment, coercivity, remanence, energy product, or high-frequency loss. Ideas related to advances of technologies such as memory, read-write heads, and spintronics should not be submitted.</p>
<h1>REQUESTED INFORMATION</h1>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources including, but not limited to, universities, university affiliated research centers, FFRDCs, and private or public companies. To ensure that all technically relevant aspects of the Request for Information (RFI) are fully addressed, technologies and capabilities should target the following criteria:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span>&bull;1.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Novelty:</strong> Of particular interest are novel methods for fabricating, assembling, or patterning of magnetic materials over the full range of 1 to 1000 micrometers in thickness with high aspect ratios. Intellectual property should be clearly established. Specifically excluded from this RFI are iterative improvements on existing magnetic film technologies. Any ideas submitted should be revolutionary in approach, and submitters should clearly indicate how their approach radically shifts the traditional paradigms of working at these dimensions. Concepts submitted must also address the underlying science and limitations of a proposed approach. Primary data is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span>&bull;2.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Capability:</strong> Any concepts submitted must display revolutionary improvements over state-of-the-art devices in both feature size and placement complexity such as multiple magnetization orientations. Additionally, concepts must provide advancement across multiple performance parameters (permeability, coercivity, remanence, etc.). Large sacrifices to improve only one measure of performance are not of interest. The CMOS process compatibility and low-stress nature of magnetic material processing technologies is desired but not required.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span>&bull;3.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Market readiness: </strong>A goal of this RFI is to identify scalable concepts for use in electronic systems at all levels from the military base to the soldier in the field. If available information describing a pathway to production is relevant, then it should be included. A risk analysis specific to the proposed concept including risk factors for both engineering and economical aspects of the technology is also encouraged.</p>
<h1>INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS</h1>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">When responding to this RFI, please include examples of current and previous work that have enabled the technology. Experimental demonstration of concepts, models, and/or information about currently licensed products is of particular interest.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Acknowledged technological barriers that should be addressed include scientific development and optimization, scale-up and manufacturing, limits on operational conditions, as well as expected device operational lifetime. An analysis of limiting factors such as materials, chemistry, and/or engineering required for the proposed concept should be highlighted.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while providing actionable insight.</span></p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 7300 contiguous net usable square feet (8030 rentable square feet) of office and related space in a building under lease at 4775 Technology Circle, Grand Forks, North Dakota, 58203.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location.  The space must be available for occupancy on or before January 1, 2010.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North- Gateway Drive
East- Washington Street 
South- County Rd 6
West- Starting at the intersection of County Rd 6 and Burlington Northern Rail Road head North on Burlington Northern Rail Road to Co Road 4 proceed west on County Road 4 to N 55th St proceed North on N 55th St to Gateway Dr

-Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
-Parking  61 adequate, on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.
4. Contact Information for Owner or Authorized Agent.

This is not a Solicitation for Offer, nor is this a request for proposal.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.

<DESC>The US Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) will host an Interested Party Workshop in support of the DOE NE Hub for Modeling and Simulation program on December 7, 2009, from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern time at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, L'Enfant Plaza; 480 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Washington, DC 20024. The purpose of this Workshop is to provide information on the Hub for Modeling and Simulation program; promote additional discussion on the topic of Modeling and Simulation, including refining program definitions; address questions from potential applicants; and provide a forum for potential applicants to express their interest and present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
The official Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) has not yet been released; upon release, it will be available on the Grants.gov website.  Efforts will be made to release a draft FOA prior to the Workshop; please refer to http://events.energetics.com/DOE-NE-M-S-09 for a posting of this draft FOA (anticipated to be posted on or about 11/19/09).  Attendance at this Workshop is not required to respond or propose to any associated FOA. The Workshop will be unclassified and Workshop presenters' briefing slides, questions and answers, and draft FOA will be made publically available for interested parties who are not able to attend the Workshop on the website at http://events.energetics.com/DOE-NE-M-S-09.                             .
PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The Hub for Modeling and Simulation (the Hub) will address basic science, technology, economic, and policy issues hindering the United State?s ability to become energy secure and economically strong while being good stewards of the planet by reducing green house gas emissions.  The Hub is to quickly push the current state-of-the-art energy science and technology towards its fundamental limits and produce revolutionary changes in how we produce and use energy.  The Hub represents a new structure, modeled after research laboratories like the Manhattan Project Labs, Lincoln Lab at MIT that developed radar, and AT&T Bell Laboratories that developed the transistor.  It will focus on a single topic, but with work spanning the gamut from (i) basic research through (ii) engineering development to (iii) partnering with industry in commercialization.  It is anticipated that the Hub will comprise a highly collaborative team that will utilize multiple s cientific, engineering, and where appropriate, economics and public-policy disciplines, working largely under one roof to solve critical technology issues. 
Nuclear energy provides a tremendous opportunity for the United States to provide energy that is secure, affordable, and environmentally friendly.  However there are a number of technical issues that must be addressed in the near, mid and long-terms.  Traditionally, creating the scientific insight needed to address the issues has been accomplished through methods that rely heavily on testing and demonstration.  While this approach has been very successful, it has been proven to take a long time and be very expensive.  Over the past decade and a half, with the introduction of very high performance computing, advanced modeling and simulation has become a peer to theory and experiment as a means to create scientific insight.  Advanced modeling and simulation that is full dimensional, high resolution, and based on first-principals science, has proven invaluable for delivering faster and more detailed insights into the operation of physical systems under conditions that were impos sible or cost-prohibitive to see in experiments.  
The Hub will utilize existing advanced modeling and simulation capabilities (e.g. computational fluid dynamics, etc.), to apply them to a new multi-physics computational code, designed to provide predictive capability for life extension and power upgrade calculations, and to adapt these advanced computer science tools into the culture of nuclear engineers. The modern, science-based simulation tools are designed to be used by specialists. Over the course of  this 5-year project, the Hub is intended to produce a multi-physics computational environment that can be used by a wide range of practitioners to conduct predictive calculations of the performance of reactors in the future for both normal and off-normal conditions. It is anticipated that the Hub will run for 5 years initially, with the award for the Hub being extended/renewed noncompetitively for up to another 5 years if it is decided the program should continue and if it is determined that the Hub recipient has delivered  exceptional scientific progress.   
ANTICIPATED FUNDING: Funding is approximately $22M for the first year and $25M per year thereafter (subject to appropriation approval) for the next four years.  
A draft agenda for this Workshop is available at:  http://events.energetics.com/DOE-NE-M-S-09  
REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Pre-Registration for this Workshop is REQUIRED.  Information concerning registering for this Workshop, hotel can be found at: http://events.energetics.com/DOE-NE-M-S-09

It is currently expected that the contract will involve approximately 3,500 acres of hoedad planting of tree seedlings and will commence during May and June of 2010.  The solicitation will be out for bid later this winter.  The purpose of this trip is to give prospective bidders the ability to view the general area of planting so that they will have a better understanding of the access challenges associated with this contract.  

The tour will begin at the Cascade Ranger District office in Cascade, Idaho at 9 am on Thursday, November 19th, 2009.  The Forest Service will lead the trip to the Warm Lake area and will point out some of the planting areas from Warm Lake highway and other dirt roads in the project area.  Maps showing approximate locations of units will be provided on the day of the tour.  Round trip distance from Cascade will be approximately 70 miles and attendees will need to provide their own transportation.  Travel to Warm Lake requires travel over Big Creek Summit on a steep, windy, paved road.   Snowy and muddy conditions can be expected, depending on weather conditions.

For further information about the tour, please contact Mark Leis (mleis@fs.fed.us  or 208-382-7400) or Dave Marben (dmarben@fs.fed.us  or 208-382-7400).

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), these services are considered a follow-on contract for the continued development and upgrades to the NASMOD system.  Based on the highly specialized nature of the NASMOD program, it is likely that award to any other source would require extensive effort, resulting in substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>Hamak, John E.,  806-356-1025,   John_Hamak@blm.gov

<DESC>INVITATION FOR OFFER-FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDSIFO NO.  BLM-2010-CHEU-001January 2010 thru December 2010
IntroductionThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO) of the Department of Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the City of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction Unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up by the successful bidder on this agreement.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 12- to 15-year life of this project.
NGL pick up is expected to take place during regular business hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  A mutually agreed-to procedure will be established where BLM personnel will contact the buyer for NGL pick up when the storage amount reaches a predetermined level.  The NGL will be stored on site and the buyer will be required to pickup the liquids via truck transport.  The buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs.
Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.  An automatic sampling system will be an integral part of the installation; however, the analysis of samples will be the responsibility of the buyer.  Operational details of the project (e.g. maps, NGL quality, etc.) are available upon request.  Interested parties are encouraged to contact John Hamak at 806-356-1025 or Nabil Dia at 806-356-1023.
You must submit a written offer via facsimile (Fax No. 806-356-1041) by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on December 15, 2009.  We will award the offers by 4:00 p.m. on December 22, 2009.  You may call John Hamak or Nabil Dia with questions about this IFO.
OffersThe offer sheet containing estimated daily production, preferred index prices, etc. may be obtained by contacting Nabil Dia at 806-356-1023 or John Hamak at 806-356-1025.  Your offer, an increment or decrement in relation to the applicable index, should be placed on the offer sheet.  Please note that we are selling all these NGL under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a base load and swing component.  The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.  
Bidder proposals will be accepted through December 15, 2009.  Please fax your proposals to fax number listed above or mail to the following address:
BLM-Amarillo Field Office801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500Amarillo, TX  79101Attn:  John Hamak
Consideration of OffersBLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) without discussions.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror could submit.  However, BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received.
The BLM shall award a Contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLMs judgment, is most advantageous to the Federal Government.  BLM will award to the buyer by means of a Natural Gas Liquids Purchase Confirmation Notice, which will also include payment instructions.
Neither party shall disclose directly or without the prior written consent of the other party the terms of any transaction to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, royalty owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, or prospective purchasers of all or substantially all of a partys assets or of any rights under this Contract, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except; (i) in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, or exchange rule, (ii) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this contract, (iii) to the extent necessary to implement any transaction, or (iv) to the extent such information is delivered to such third party for the sole purpose of calculating a published index.  Each party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure of the terms of any transaction (other than as permitted hereunder) and use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit the disclosure.  The existence of this Contract is not subject to this confidentiality obligation.  The parties hereunder shall keep the terms of any transaction confidential for one year from the expiration of the transaction. 
TermInitial deliveries of Federal NGL to the buyer will commence January 1, 2010.  The delivery period will be for a term of twelve months ending December 31, 2010, unless either party cancels the transaction.  
The reasons for which BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to:
(1)  The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within five [5] business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer pays BLM such amounts as it concedes to be correct; (2)  Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated; or(3)  The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to BLM.
Transportation and Planning of Natural Gas LiquidsThe buyer agrees to take 100 percent of the Federal NGL delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in NGL production levels and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry, will communicate directly with BLM.  The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal NGL at the delivery point.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point, nor is it responsible for storage costs of the Cliffside facility.  However, the buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs during and after pickup of the NGL from the plant site.
No later than eight (8) calendar days before the first day of each month, BLM will notify the buyer of the weekly liquid volumes and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made, but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of Federal NGL.  This will continue for each month of the delivery period.
Liquidated DamagesBLM will remarket the NGL in the event an early contract termination occurs.  BLM will collect from the terminated party an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the contract price less the price at which BLM is able to remarket the NGL not purchased, using commercially reasonable efforts in an arms-length transaction.

In accordance with AFARS 5113.303-1, the Government reserves the right to conduct Reverse Auctions. Exact future requirements are not known at this time and there is no guarantee of requirements in the future. Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government. Future requirement Call Orders will be identified by a Call Order numbering system determined by the Government. BPA holders selected by the Contracting Officer through BPA Holder vendor rotation will be notified electronically of new Call Order requirements through the issuance of a Call Order RFQ email from either the Contracting Officer or their designated Ordering Officer, identifying either (a) the OEM part number, description, quantity, required delivery date and date/time for submission of the quotation and/or (b) a product specification, quantity, required delivery date and date/time for submission of the quotation. The BPA contractors shall submit through the forum identified in the Call Order email its quotation for price and delivery in response to the Call Order. The Contracting Officer or their designated Ordering Officer shall specify the Call Order Quotation response time for each Call Order dependent upon the size and complexity of the order. Failure to submit a complete and timely response to a BPA Call Order RFQ may result in it being determined non-responsive to the Call Order RFQ and may serve as the basis for reduced use of the contractor during subsequent vendor rotation or cancellation of the BPA in its entirety. The award of all Call Orders issued under BPAs established through this solicitation and synopsis will be based on best value, price and other factors considered unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer. Contractors submitting a timely response and adequate documentation required in response to this synopsis and solicitation, and to whom a BPA is ultimately awarded, agree to waive their right to protest the award of all future Call Orders. Upon the notification of the issuance of a specific Call Order to the successful BPA Holder, that contractor shall assume responsibility for updating the projected delivery date for each Call Order item on a bi-weekly basis either through e-mail submission or other means specified by the Government in the BPA. The BPA Holders performance in meeting the required delivery date, which will be based on calendar days after date of issuance of Call Order, will be reflected in the contractors past performance assessment. All BPA Holders determined under this synopsis and solicitation will be required to bill and accept payment through both the Government Purchase Card, and the Governments Wide Area Work Flow system. If the dollar value of the Call Order exceeds the authority of the Government Purchase Card Holder, then a BPA order will be issued by the Contracting Officer. The contractor will be required to identify the location of its ordering/receiving facility to ensure that it is within 60 miles of Gate 1 at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. All requests for Call Order requirements determined to be outside this radius will not be honored as any subsequent proposal would be considered to be non-responsive to the requirements of the synopsis/solicitation. The determination of the Government concerning the 60 miles from Gate 1 distance at Redstone Arsenal, AL is under the sole purview of the Contracting Officer and may be disputed by any contractors determined to be outside the commuting distance, but will not be the basis of withholding the issuance of BPAs to otherwise successful contractors. Contractors determined by the Contracting Officer to be within the required 60 miles commuting distance may not be disputed by other contractors. <BR><BR>3.11 Place of delivery will vary, but most deliveries will go to the AMCOM JTC/SIL, BLDG 6263 or one its surrounding annexes, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5280.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is W911W6-10-C-0029 and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Avaiation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award a firm fixed price contract utilizing FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Commercial Items.  The intent is to purchase a Hurco VMX42 Vertical Machining Center.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act.  The machine must come with sufficient software to enable the conversational control control to interface with an existing rotary table, and be able to produce 4th axis conversational type programs.  The intended source for this machine is Beckman Precision, Inc. 415 Brookshire Road, Greer, SC.  Beckman Precision is the only Hurco dealer for the Virginia geographical area.  Desired delivery is 120 days after contract award.  The requirement is for a computer numerically controlled (CNC) Vertical Machining Center with the capability to interface with existing Hurco VMX 42 and VMX 62.  AATD personnel have been trained on the Hurco machine control and will use this same control with the new machine to be purchased.  This will reduce the cost of introducing a different type of machine control along with additional training dollars that would be needed.  Purchase of the Hurco machine will also provide commonality between machines and ensure faster and more efficient operations.  The machine will be used to rapidly machine components from solid metal for final products that AATD is required to fabricate.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the due date and time in this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Abby and Emily Rapoport, granddaughters of Madison Council founding
members Audre and Bernie Rapoport, have generously donated funds to the Library of Congress to establish a landmark traveling exhibition program that will introduce the Librarys unmatched resources to new audiences across the country, particularly in rural communities. Through the Abby and Emily Rapoport Traveling Exhibition Program, local libraries, university galleries and libraries, and historical societies across the nation will be offered a high quality facsimile and graphic presentation drawn from two of the Librarys most popular past exhibitions, American Treasures and World Treasures.

The exhibition will be presented in a mobile unit format with a goal of reaching one hundred venues over a twelve month period. The Abby and Emily Rapoport Traveling Exhibition Program will provide relevant and engaging learning experiences for students, teachers, and lifelong learners. The program will also promote the interactive capabilities of the myloc.gov  web site and excite interest in the Library of Congress as a premier destination for individuals planning a trip to Washington, D.C.

This project will be the first of its kind executed by the Library of Congress. 

The Library seeks a vendor to supply a fully furnished mobile unit for a period of approximately twelve months completing presentations at one hundred venues at the rate of approximately two per week.  The mobile unit will be a full-size tractor trailer combination with a minimum of seven hundred square feet of exhibition display space capability.  The mobile unit will be launched in the Fall of 2010 from the Library of Congress in conjunction with a kick-off celebration TBD.  The mobile unit will travel a route TBD by the Library in consultation with the vendor and with final approval from the donors.  The route will include, but not be limited to, local libraries, schools, historical societies, colleges and universities, small town streets and parking lots, and other sites TBD.  The mobile unit will be outfitted by the vendor with eye catching exterior graphic applications promoting the Library of Congress Abby and Emily Rapoport Traveling Exhibition Program.  The vendor will furnish the interior exhibition space with facsimile presentations drawn from the Librarys American and World Treasures exhibitions (both exhibitions can be found on the web at http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures, and http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/world respectively).  All content, images and text, will be supplied by the Library in electronic format for approximately 140160 objects.  The image files will be supplied in high resolution in order to produce high quality facsimiles.  Any 3-D props will be supplied by the vendor per the final design plan.  The exhibition space will also provide up to four internet stations, and up to four MP3 player stations (Example = Corn players, LOC to provide specifications), and one audio visual station to feature a short film as determined by the final design.  The exhibition ephemera and finishes will be consistent with Library of Congress exhibition standards and quality, and satisfy all applicable safety, ADA, and security requirements.  The vendor will fabricate and install all necessary exhibition elements for the interior and exterior following a detailed approval process outlined below.  The vendor will provide detailed interior and exterior preliminary design drawings for Library review and approval.  The vendor will provide the Library with any necessary revised drawings until final design and construction drawings are approved by the Library.  The vendor will work with the Library of Congress project manager to maintain successful operation of the tour once the mobile unit is launched. The vendor will also provide thorough logistical support for the mobile unit during the tour, as well as pre-tour and post-tour travel, and coordinate with host venues and the Library.  The vendor shall follow any and all related local, state, and federal laws obtaining any and all necessary permits, insurance, and licenses for the operation of a mobile unit.  The vendor shall be responsible for providing internet capability to any and all internet stations as per the final design plan.

Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your proposal: 52.247-34 F.O.B Destination. Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the Offeror that meets the solicitation's minimum criteria for (i) technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement (ii) past performance at the lowest (iii) price. Offeror's proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  Only those offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to the following:  Offerors must furnish documentation that adequately demonstrates the vendor's ability to produce segmented thread rings within drawing specifications.  Such documentation can be existing literature, previous or similar builds of various segmented thread rings (internal or external threads), engineering designs, inspection records, certification records, or any other documentation literature that demonstrates the vendor's ability to produce the required items.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  OUTSTANDING:  Very little to not potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.  SATISFACTORY:  Little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.  MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 9.104, in order to validate responsibility, the Offeror must furnish sufficient information that demonstrates that the Offeror has the necessary manufacturing equipment, inspection sources, tools and other materials and resources to fabricate the required gages and meet the required delivery schedule.  In addition, the vendor is provide copies of applicable commercially published price lists pertaining to your company's products that meet the specifications, along with applicable government discounts.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued via the US EPA RTP website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. The solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10079 and the solicitation is being issued as full and open competition FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541380 and the Small Business Size Standard is $12 Million.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.

EPA has a requirement to analyze up to 750 water, sediment, and biosolid samples for a number of specified sterols using Standard EPA Method 1698: Steroids and Hormones in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by HRGC/HRMS (December 2007) or a modification of the method when approved under Deliverable 1 of this contract.  The Offer shall prepare pricing on a per sample basis, not-to-exceed 750 samples for the entire order.EPA will use thirty-six existing plots (0.75 x 2 m) on USDA-owned land in Oconee County, Georgia to conduct a series of rainfall simulation experiments.  Rainfall simulators, commonly used for nutrient and pathogen transport studies, will be employed to observe fate and transport of sterols associated with animal manure applied to each simulator. 
Simulated rainfall will be applied to the plots at a set rate equivalent to a precipitation return period commonly observed in the Georgia Piedmont, sufficient to produce a surface runoff event.  Runoff will be collected at the hydraulically lower end of each plot.  Baseline simulations will be conducted to determine background sterol levels.  The plot treatments will consist of manure applications from three animal types: swine (liquid manure), beef cattle (solid manure), and poultry (broiler litter), and a control treatment (no manure application).  Each treatment will have three replications and three manure application timings relative to rainfall simulation time.  Manure will be analyzed for sterol loadings previous to application via randomized composite samples. 
The contractor must state in their proposed methodology the anticipated range of efficiency of extraction from liquid and solid phases, concentration factors for liquid phases and anticipated detection limits for each of the listed sterols below.Up to, but not exceeding, 750 samples will be generated for the sterol analysis from December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010.  Twenty gram sediment and biosolid samples and one liter runoff samples will be collected in the field by EPA staff.  Solids samples will be frozen (-10 degrees Centigrade); and liquids samples will be refrigerated (2-4 degrees Centigrade); and all samples will be delivered to the contractor within 24 hours of collection.  
Filtration of runoff samples and extraction of the filtrate (water phase) must be performed by the contractor within 48 hours of receipt.  The filter retentate can be frozen, stored, and then thawed up to 48 hours prior to extraction.  Sediment and biosolids samples can be thawed up to 48 hours prior to analysis.  All sample extractions should occur within 7 days following receipt of samples.  Analysis of extracts must be completed within 14 calendar days following receipt of the samples.  Results of the analyses for each sample set will be sent to EPA every 21 calendar days after receipt of the initial samples until all analyses are completed.Sample Description, Collection and Delivery Schedule:	
Liquid filtrate samples require immediate processing, while processing of the resulting frozen filtered retentate portion of the samples are not as time sensitive.  Table A enumerates the total number of samples generated during the four sampling events.  - For each of the Sampling Events, samples generated during the day 1, week 1, and week 2 runs will occur over a staggered 2 ? 3 day time frame.  Thus, sample shipments will occur each day for 2-3 days as samples are generated for each of the three runs.  Liquid sample shipments will not exceed a total of 12 filtrate samples for any given day of sampling and shipping.  - Manure and sediment samples will be shipped frozen and will be analyzed within the same time frame as specified for the filter retentate solids. 
EPA will notify the contractor of the anticipated sample ship dates as soon as they are known.Deliverables: 1) The contractor will set up an initial conference call with EPA within three business days of award of this contract to discuss the anticipated start date for this project which is dependent on the outcome of pilot testing of the rainfall simulators currently being carried out by EPA researchers.  The contractor will also at this time discuss, for final details and approval, any other analytical method or any modification to the Standard EPA Method 1698: Steroids and Hormones in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by HRGC/HRMS (December 2007) proposed by the contractor in the contract proposal and accepted by EPA for use in this work. 2) The work in this contract will result in the generation of primary data. Consistent with the Agency?s Quality Assurance (QA) requirements, the contractor must prepare a project-specific Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and analysis plan to assure the quality of the primary data generated.  The QAPP shall specify data quality objectives, best practices and frequency, scope of appropriate QA reports, method performance information, recovery information, matrix spikes, and positive and negative controls clearly included in the sample processing protocol. 3) During each rainfall simulation run, EPA will collect samples for analysis of fecal sterols as outlined in table A of the SOW.  The samples will be shipped out on ice (filtrate at 2-4 degrees centigrade and filter retentate at minus 20 degrees centigrade) for receipt by the contractor to perform sterol within 24 hours of collection.  The fecal sterols to be analyzed are as stipulated in Table B of the SOW. 4) Preliminary data results for sterol analysis shall be provided to EPA no later 21 calendar days after sample receipt.  - Sampling Run: Day 1, Week 1, Week 2 ? Preliminary Report of Results for each sampling run are due 21 calendar days after sample receipt. The contractor shall have a 15 day period for preparation of the Sampling Event Final Report.  This period starts immediately after delivery of the last (?Week 2?) preliminary report.  Sampling Event Final Report ? Due 15 calendar days after completion of last preliminary report. 
Data described immediately above, should be provided electronically in an Excel file, summarizing samples grouped by run for each sampling event. This reporting procedure will be repeated four times --- once for each of the four sampling events.Refer to the Statement of Work for more details regarding this requirement.Evaluation Criteria: The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or other factors considered. For this Request for Quotation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  This procurement will be awarded on a best value basis per the following evaluation criteria:  1) Capacity - The vendor must demonstrate that they have the capacity to process all samples according to the sample holding times and sample delivery as outlined in the SOW.  2) Methodology - The vendor must demonstrate that they have the equipment and capability to implement and conduct the standard method as provided, or demonstrate that they have experience conducting a viable, proven modified method for analysis of the sterols as identified.  3) Past Performance - Previous experience as evidenced by references (should provide 2 ? can be other types of analyses, not just sterol.   Include telephone number, name of contact, analyses provided, and date(s) service was provided.  4) Price

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.)

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Technology Acquisition Center intends to enter into a twelve-month Firm-Fixed-Price contract with Global Management Consulting (GMC), LLC, 41833 Cordgrass Circle, Stone Ridge, VA 20105 pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  Veterans Hospital Association's VHA electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) / Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), has a built-in capability for developing custom electronic forms.  The application under consideration has the following potential advantages over the built-in forms capabilities of CPRS:  1) Non-developer users, such as clinical application coordinators, will be able to create the forms using a drag-and-drop style interface 2) the data collected by the forms can be stored in VistA files or a Structured Query Language (SQL) database for further analysis and processing 3) forms developed using this application can include design elements, such as tables, rich text, graphics, and audio and video 4) business logic may be incorporated into the forms through a scripting language.  The proposed application also has the following advantages over custom form interfaces developed using Web or desktop programming languages: 1) No special knowledge of programming needed to create the forms 2) the forms are displayed to users within CPRS rather than via a standalone interface 3) forms are associated with note titles and invoked from the Notes tab in CPRS 4) a text note is generated from the form data and stored in Text Integration Utility (TIU) 5) data from VistA may be imported into the form to pre-populate form fields, 6) forms may be easily modified without the need for updating source code or recompiling applications.This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number VA118-10-RQ-0023 in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  This purchase is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Please see attached document VA118-10-RQ-0023.

Please clarify what is meant by A-grade and B-grade. <BR>ANSWER: A-Grade refers to the best possible product line available, given the Rough Order of Magnitude of this project. B-Grade refers to an alternative product line which, while not necessarily equal to the A-grade product line, still achieves the design objectives desired by the Government.<BR><BR>2. What is the floor-to-ceiling height of the space? <BR>ANSWER: The floor-to-ceiling height of the space is approximately 96 inches. Please see the revised Exhibit A, available at https://www3.natick.army.mil/current.cfm or by email from john.conlin3@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>3.

What is the hierarchical relationship of the personnel who will work in these offices?<BR>ANSWER: Personnel who will occupy the Executive Suite (Rooms 1-7) will be senior management.

Power to be at desk height or at base level?<BR>ANSWER: Either, or both, configurations would be acceptable.<BR><BR>10. Does your group work with oversize documents?<BR>ANSWER: No. The personnel occupying these offices will be working with standard sized documents.<BR><BR>11. Please confirm typical equipment requirements for each station: Monitor (flat panel?) CPU and keyboard tray?  Do some users have multiple monitors?  Perhaps a monitor arm in each station?  <BR>ANSWER: All personnel who will work in these offices will use dual flat-panel monitors.

If true floor-to-ceiling panels are proposed, will the Offeror be able to coordinate with the property manager to properly arrange HVAC? <BR>ANSWER: No. Offerors whose proposals are downselected for Phase 2 evaluation will have an opportunity to visit the installation site and adjust their proposed layouts to accommodate the existing HVAC. Offerors will then be able to revise their pricing accordingly, before submitting a revised final proposal for Phase 2 evaluation.<BR><BR>2. Are all four of the higher walled stations together, or two for Room 8 and two for Room 10? <BR>ANSWER: There should be at least one high walled work station in Room 8 and one in Room 10.

In Rooms 8 & 10, do you need a power pole or base feed?<BR>ANSWER: Either option would be acceptable. The Government will be responsible for configuring electrical hook-ups to accommodate the successful Offeror(s).<BR><BR>8. CLIN 0002 requests that no stations be laid out in front of the floor to ceiling windows in Room 10, but is this flexible in any way?  <BR>ANSWER: The Government prefers that these windows not be blocked. However, the Offeror may propose a design not meeting this request if the Offeror feels that its design represents the best overall solution for the Government.<BR><BR>9. For the modular systems furniture, does the Government prefer monolithic or segmented Panels?<BR>ANSWER: Offerors may propose either kind, according to what they determine is the best overall design solution for the Government. Offerors are reminded that the Government will evaluate proposals for unique, creative and innovative methods, processes and or solutions that are beneficial and responsive to the Governments needs.<BR><BR>10. The RFP mentions a revolving storage rack. Please clarify what this is.  <BR>ANSWER: The Government intends to use these racks to store letter-sized file folders. The Government prefers a file storage solution that could provide approximately 300 linear feet of storage and could accommodate letter (8.5in x 11in) and legal (8.5in x 14in) sized file folders.<BR><BR>Questions Concerning CLIN 0003:<BR><BR>1.

Do you mean you want glass on top of the wood or laminate as a protection or do you mean you want a desk composed of glass tops that you actually see through?  <BR>ANSWER: The Governments preference for glass tops on work surfaces should be interpreted as a piece of glass laid on top of a work surface for protection. <BR><BR><BR>Questions Concerning CLIN 0002<BR><BR>1. Is it desirable to have the floor-to-ceiling workstations next to the exterior walls, or is that not desirable?  <BR>ANSWER: The Government does not have a general preference for one layout over another.

<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.

<p>(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract.

The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted.

Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>

PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>
<p>b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.</p>
<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.<br />20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.<br />21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005) <br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. <br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day. <br />22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):<br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following:</p>
<p>(i) Invoice date; <br />(ii) Name of Contractor; <br />(iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total;<br />(iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading);<br />(v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment);<br />(vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and <br />(vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified. <br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97 177):</p>
<p>(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. <br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. <br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

<DESC>The response time for the Request Informations for is extended until 20 Nov 2009. This a repeat of the previous narrative posted on 4 Nov 2009. Attached is a copy of the DRAFT performance specification (MIL-PRF-32335) titled Interim Military Performance Specification TriCon Refrigerated Container System (TRCS). This specification covers three different types of systems as follows: Type I - electrically powered refrigeration/freezing/heating unit with full width double doors; Type II* - diesel/electric powered refrigeration/freezing/heating unit with full width double doors; Type III - electrically powered rerigeration/freezing/heating unit with a single man door with recessed operating handle.  * For Type II, it is anticipated that an Engineering Change Proposal Clause will implemented into the future solicitation/contract.  The Government intends to procure the best value, current leading edge refrigerated container system to meet the specified requirements.  In addition, the DRAFT specification contains an interface requirement to allow the previously fielded Refrigeration Unit (Thermo King Model: VM405 PBDD2) to fit with the new TRCS insulated container.  For Type I, the TRCS will have very specific equipment pack out requirement.  A packing plan will be provided as an addendum to the DRAFT specification.  This DRAFT performance specification is being released to commercial industry for review, comments and questions.  The specification will be used to support a planned acquisition of the TRCS for the Army and Air Force in 2010.  The Governments intent is to develop a performance specification that meets multi-service Military requirements while allowing industry to provide innovate, cost effective, quality, safe and sustainable systems.  As part of this RFI, the Government also asks that information (i.e. marketing sheets, specification sheets, drawings, test report, manual, etc.) be provided by industry to identify if you have a TRCS system that currently meets all of the stated requirements, if changes are required to an existing system to meet the requirements or if a new system must be developed.  If modifications are required, please identify what changes are necessary.  Please also provide estimated pricing data for existing systems and the cost for modifications to meet the stated requirements as written.  If industry believes there are requirements that significantly drive the cost up or are unattainable by best commercial practices, please also identify those issues in your comments.  Items currently annotated in red text need to be reviewed and finalized by the Government before the TRCS Solicitation is released.  If interested, please mark up the current DRAFT using the Track Changes or Insert Comments features imbedded in Microsoft Word.  Consolidated comments, changes and questions from commercial industry are due back to the Government no later than COB 20 November 2009.  Industry can also request a teleconference via email with the Governments Point of Contacts at their convenience.  The POCs are: Mr. Paul Mandile (Combat Feeding Directorate) and Mr. Benjamin Campbell (Product Manager - Force Sustainment Systems), US Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center.

<SUBJECT>RFI - Monitoring of Compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier and Unique Employer identifier Rules
<SOLNBR>CMS-RFI-100177a
<RESPDATE>120109
<ARCHDATE>12022009
<CONTACT>Denise Buenning , Email OESSRFI@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information:<br /></strong>Monitoring of Compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier and Unique Employer Identifier Rules</p>
<p>Summary: Six years have elapsed since the first effective date of mandatory compliance under the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance and Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). While the total number of complaints related to Transactions and Code Sets, National Provider Identifier, and Unique Identifier is small in comparison to the size of the industry; some industry representatives believe that the extent of non-compliance is higher than the figures represented in CMS' complaint statistics. In advance of the January 1, 2012 compliance date for the updated X12 version 5010, and NCPDP Version D.0, and 3.0 standards, and the October 1, 2013 compliance deadline for ICD-10 code sets as set forth in the final rules published on January 16, 2009, it is important for CMS to ensure that the industry is in compliance with the current versions of the transactions and code sets. Thus, we are proactively looking at options to improve and enhance the current enforcement process. We have prepared this Request for Information (RFI) to secure industry input on specific topics to help us to refine future strategies for the HIPAA enforcement process. <br />Background for HIPAA Regulations: The final rule, Health Insurance Reform: Standards for Electronic Transactions (TCS), was published on August 17, 2000, and the subsequent Modifications to the HIPAA Electronic Transaction Standards rules were published on February 20, 2003 and January 16, 2009 (final rules). These rules require covered entities (CEs) (health plans, health care clearinghouses, and certain health care providers) to implement standards and code sets for certain electronic transactions, including: health care claims/encounters; health care payment and remittance advice; coordination of benefits (COB); eligibility inquiry and response; health care claim status and response; enrollment and dis-enrollment in a health plan; referral certification and authorization inquiry and response; and health plan premium payments.</p>
<p>On May 31, 2002, the final rule, Health Insurance Reform: Standard Unique Employer Identifier was published and it became effective in July 2002. The rule adopted the Employer Identification Number (EIN) as the standard unique employer identifier and requires CEs to use the EIN in all standard transactions that require an employer identifier to identify a person or entity as an employer. On January 23, 2004, the HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Standard Unique Health Identifier for Health Care Providers final rule was published. It became effective in May 2005, and compliance was required by May 23, 2008. It adopted the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the standard identifier for all covered health care providers, and requires all CEs to use (send and receive) this identifier in standard transactions.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2006, HHS published the final Enforcement Rule governing the investigation of noncompliance with the HIPAA regulations, and made such investigations and penalties applicable to all of the Administrative Simplification rules, rather than exclusively to the HIPAA privacy standards. <br /><br />Enforcement strategy to date: Enforcement of the HIPAA rules is complaint driven. CMS receives complaints from the public, other government agencies, and covered entities. Each complaint is investigated, typically through a request for additional information or documentation from the complainant, as well as documentation, proof of compliance or a corrective action plan from the filed against entity (FAE). The results of each investigation have often resulted in contract changes, and/or modification to trading partner agreements, procedures or technologies, as appropriate. In some cases, following an entity's immediate steps to mitigate a particular issue, that entity finds other vulnerabilities or procedural issues which are also rectified. In some cases a longer term corrective action plan is developed and is monitored by CMS over an agreed upon period of time.</p>
<p>The 2006 Enforcement Rule also gave CMS the authority to conduct compliance reviews, and in 2007, CMS invoked that authority with respect to the Security Rule. Eleven comprehensive compliance reviews of assorted covered entity types have been conducted to date. Based on the findings, CMS has provided technical assistance and guidance to each of the covered entities.</p>
<p>Prevalence of TCS and Unique Identifier complaints: We have received over 600 TCS complaints since 2005, and 43 NPI complaints since 2008 (but no complaints related to the EIN). We are not certain if these complaints are truly representative of industry's compliance challenges, particularly since more than half of the complaints dealt with the issue of negotiating very specific trading partner agreements. Therefore, additional information about the HIPAA compliance environment could be invaluable in helping CMS better understand the scope of non-compliance issues to better target our approach to both outreach and enforcement.</p>
<p>Nature of current complaints: Though the CMS complaint volume is small, the nature of the allegations we have received lead us to believe that there may still be some challenges with respect to effective implementation of the rules, in spite of the time that has passed since the mandatory compliance date. Examples of some of the complaints we continue to receive are: <br />&bull; Failure to implement the full suite of transactions (e.g. COB, eligibility, referrals and authorizations); <br />&bull; Non-compliance with format or content requirements from the Implementation Guides; <br />&bull; Use of companion guides with requirements that conflict with implementation guides;<br />&bull; Code sets and/or code set rule violations - non-compliant use or non-compliant instructions for uses; <br />&bull; Continued use of legacy provider numbers;<br />&bull; Excessive fees charged by clearinghouses.</p>
<p>We hope that the feedback from this RFI will help us determine if the complaints about compliance are a result of ongoing technical issues with X12 4010 or NCPDP 5.1, or if they are the result of other organizational operational challenges.</p>
<p>Possible barriers to complaints: We understand that some providers have alleged that they would not file a complaint against a health plan for rejecting a compliant transaction, because they fear the health plan will slow or reduce their payment rates, or take other harmful actions. We do not have evidence of such, but would be interested in hearing from the industry if there have in fact been instances of retaliation for such communication. We recognize that some complainants wish to remain anonymous. While there are times when this can be accommodated, there are certain situations in which anonymity is a barrier to resolution, since the name of the affected entity and a sample transaction can assist in researching the complaint. We would like to solicit input on alternative complaint filing processes to create a more conducive environment for complainants.</p>
<p>Future enforcement strategy: Based on the substantive findings of the Security compliance reviews, CMS believes there could be similar benefits from reviews to assess compliance with the requirements of the Transactions, Code Sets and Unique Identifier rules. Possible benefits might include an increase in the use of certain transactions, a decreased reliance on companion guides, and/or an increase in efficiency and compliance.</p>
<p>We believe that a compliance review program would help us to understand and target the major contributing factors to non-compliance. Such information could be instructive in identifying issues related to standards development, implementation planning and execution for future versions of the standards. It could also identify educational gaps, program opportunities and outreach activities for Medicare, Medicaid, and the private sector.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are soliciting input from the industry to help us to fine-tune the current complaint-driven enforcement process. We are requesting industry input and insight on possible improvements to the current enforcement process as well as the usefulness and structure of a compliance review program. In this RFI, we've outlined a number of topics about which we would like feedback and creative recommendations as follows:</p>
<p>1. Information about the extent of the industry's noncompliance. <br />Describe: (i) key problem areas (technical vs. business); (ii) prevalence of specific TCS, NPI and EIN non-compliance; (iii) patterns of non-compliance among specific transaction types and entity types; and (iv) the extent of implementation of the TCS, NPI and EIN standards.</p>
<p>2. Comments on barriers to complaints being filed, and how to eliminate those barriers.<br /><br />3. Comments on the strength and weakness, with explanation, of the current complaint process.</p>
<p>4. The usefulness of compliance reviews in identifying: (i) problem implementation areas specific to certain covered entity types (ii) problem implementation areas specific to certain transaction types; and (iii) challenges with the standards.</p>
<p>5. The methods that could be employed to execute the compliance reviews, including the process for identifying entities for review.</p>
<p>6. Recommendations for the logistics for conducting compliance reviews.</p>
<p>7. Any alternative enforcement strategies.</p>
<p>Instructions for submittal of Comments:</p>
<p>Comments must be submitted as Microsoft word documents, using Version 2007. Each topic should be clearly delineated with an appropriate heading as noted above, and all recommendations should include specific examples. The submission shall be no more than 6 single-sided, single-spaced pages (excluding the cover page), and use a minimum font of 12 point (Time New Roman). Submissions must be electronic, and to be sent via email to Denise Buenning at OESSRFI@cms.hhs.gov by 5:00 p.m., Tuesday, December 01, 2009.</p>
<p>CMS will use the information submitted in response to this RFI at its discretion and will not provide comments to any vendor's submission. However, responses to the RFI submitted may be reflected in a final solicitation. CMS reserves the right to contact any vendor that responds to this RFI for the sole purpose of enhancing CMS' understanding of your RFI submission.</p>
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions.</p>

<p>1.1 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Imagery, such as vertical and oblique aerial photography and mapping are a critical component in the management of response and recovery operations following a natural, technological or manmade disaster. Imagery acquired in the immediate aftermath of an emergency provides situational awareness for emergency managers and a detailed record of damage for use in response, recovery and mitigation efforts. It is critical that imagery and derived products such as, damage polygons, surge lines, inundation, etc. are made available to emergency management officials in the shortest possible amount of time after a declared emergency or disaster. <br />The ability to easily and rapidly integrate imagery products with other geospatial data within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment is also critical to effective response, recovery and post disaster mitigation missions. Therefore these imagery products must be digital, rectified to the earth's surface using conventional coordinate systems and projections, and be accompanied by complete metadata. Examples of mission support use of post-disaster imagery integrated with other spatial data within a GIS environment include: damage assessments, search and rescue, debris estimation, flooding extents and hazardous materials release.</p>
<p>The paramount concern is providing timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed information with the ability to interface with GIS to key emergency management officials.</p>
<p>1.2 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain industry feedback on current practices and anticipated new concepts with respect to post disaster remote sensing services, imagery collection, derived products and the ability to rapidly store, orthorectify and disseminate collected information.</p>
<p>To achieve this purpose, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is evaluating the need to establish an internal capability to issue contracts for remote sensing services during emergency events and Stafford Act Declarations to support FEMA responsibilities under Emergency Support Function (ESF) 5 of the National Response Framework to provide geographic information, imagery, and analyses to all Federal agencies, ESF partners, and states. DHS seeks input from industry regarding its capabilities and solutions to provide airborne imagery and derived products quickly and in a GIS-ready form that can be used by emergency managers to make critical decisions.</p>
<p>DHS is also considering multiple Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts to meet these anticipated requirements. These contracts would be used to support "no-notice" type events characterized by little to no advanced warning, such as flash floods, tornados, and earthquakes and events for which there is the opportunity to prepare and mobilize, particularly hurricanes.</p>
<p>In addition, DHS is evaluating the need for "readiness" or "preparedness" tasks within the scope of the anticipated IDIQ contracts. Such tasks might require periodic meeting with key emergency management officials to plan and coordinate for post disaster imagery collection activities, table top and field preparedness exercises that would include tests of imagery collection capabilities, and developing capabilities that would allow DHS to have continuous awareness of aircraft, crew and sensor availability to support mission needs.</p>
<p>1.3 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>FEMA is the designated lead agency to coordinate the federal response to and support for state governments during the response and recovery from disasters declared under the Robert T. Stafford Act. Remotely sensed imagery may be required to provide situational awareness during response or to document post-event conditions to guide recovery and mitigation efforts. In either case, imagery and derived products must be acquired, analyzed and disseminated rapidly to a broad community of agencies and organizations who support response and recovery operations.</p>
<p>1.4 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p>To meet post disaster event imagery needs, FEMA issues Mission Assignments to a federal agency that holds IDIQ contracts for surveying and mapping services. FEMA must first prepare a set of requirements (action requests) which are forwarded to the agency that is acting as FEMA's executive agent. The supporting agency prepares a scope of services and provides FEMA with a cost estimate. FEMA then prepares a Mission Assignment to the supporting agency. At this point, the supporting agency issues a contract for services.</p>
<p>The contractor obtains imagery of the Area-of-Interest (AOI) and ships the information back to its production facility for processing. Once the imagery is processed to orthophotography, the contractor makes multiple copies of the data on portable hard drives and sends the media via overnight express to numerous organizations that exploit the imagery to produce cartographic and GIS products. Overnight shipments continue until the AOI is captured and the imagery is fully processed. Development of derived products proceeds as imagery is delivered in increments until imagery from the entire AOI is collected and processed. Multiple copies of the processed imagery are copied to portable disks for distribution to agencies with top priority requirements. The data is then published via the USGS Hazards Data Distribution System (HDDS) which provides access to the imagery via web mapping services, FTP and clip-and-ship to produce additional copies on hard copy media.</p>
<p>1.5 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p>DHS seeks to implement a streamlined post event imagery collection operation that is flexible in meeting the specialized needs of disaster response and recovery. Paramount is the need for speed in the delivery of products to decision makers and the ability to provide wide dissemination of products in an effective manner. To meet these objectives, DHS is considering multiple IDIQ contracts as the appropriate contract vehicle to support response and recovery missions. However, as this is an RFI, and not a Request for Proposals, the specific number of contracts to be awarded and the requirements for those contracts are still to be determined.</p>
<p>The anticipated functional requirement for post event imagery collection will be for digital orthophotography at resolutions between 6 inches and 2-feet using digital camera systems that deliver processed imagery in 4 co-registered bands (red, green, blue, and near infrared). In additional DHS may have requirements for the acquisition of oblique imagery of populated areas at a 1-foot resolution in natural color.</p>
<p>As further guidance to respondents of this RFI, DHS anticipates that the acquisition and processing of post event imagery will be based on the following concepts:</p>
<p>1. Acquisition will be prioritized based on the level of damage <br />It is expected that damage priorities will be divided into 3 or 4 categories. This may necessitate contractors to design separate acquisition plans for each area of damage priority because the areas will be irregularly shaped and may require acquisition using flight lines that are not oriented north-to-south or east-to-west.</p>
<p>2. Rapid Delivery of Post-Event Imagery is Critical.<br />As the contractor obtains and processes the imagery (vertical and/or oblique, and possibly videography), the Contractor will support emergency managers by publishing an uninspected version of the imagery using a temporary Web-Mapping Service at the contractor's site until processed imagery can be sent to a Government site for hosting and dissemination to the broad range of responding agencies. It is expected that the initial versions of the imagery will contain tonal mismatches and other possible artifacts. The Contractor may also be required to distribute limited copies of the processed imagery via electronic transfer. Once the acquisition is completed and the imagery has been inspected by the Government, the Contractor will produce a final tone-corrected version of the imagery. This final version will disseminated as the authoritative version of the imagery.</p>
<p>3. Innovative Technology Solutions for Rapid Processing and Dissemination <br />Contractors may also have the ability to produce an initial version of the imagery using field-deployed equipment and personnel and to disseminate data electronically from the field.</p>
<p>4. The Support System Should be Regularly Tested<br />It is anticipated that DHS will conduct an annual exercise in order to test operational plans, procedures and technologies. Contractors will receive a task order to cover the costs incurred through participation in the exercise. The exercise will require collection, processing and dissemination of imagery for a pre-selected area. Performance metrics will be collected for all activities including those for the Contractors but also for those related to government activities for acquisition, data publication and dissemination. This exercise will also be an opportunity for IDIQ holders to demonstrate and to test new applications, technologies and procedures.</p>
<p>5. Performance Must be Objectively Measured<br />DHS anticipates that advances in technology and program management will continue to reduce the time necessary to acquire, process and deliver imagery and derived products to emergency managers and planners. Further, DHS anticipates that processes for issuing and managing task orders will be refined and that efficiency will also continue to improve. DHS will develop objective measurable criteria and will report on improvement in response times to produce imagery and data products after an event.</p>

<DESC>Materials Research & Design (MR&D) is proposing in the SBIR Phase II an effort todevelop a tool for predicting the fatigue life of C/SiC composite laminates, whichincorporates mechanical loading at any minimum stress to maximum stress ratio (i.e., Rvalue), at room and elevated temperatures, in either inert or oxidizing environments. Thesuccess of this effort would represent a significant state-of-the-art improvement infatigue projections of ceramic matrix composites, since no tools capable of accomplishingthis have ever been developed. The developed algorithm, implemented via user-definedsubroutines operating within the ABAQUS public domain finite element software, willrepresent a significant new addition to the suite tools currently available to CMCdesigners.

<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. In compliance with this act, the Government posts this notice that a competitive award for $2,693,683.00 was made on a Multiple Award Construction Contract to Syska Hennessy Group, Inc. as task order N68711-05-D-4014-0026.
Rationale for this type of action is as follows: This acquisition is to support the Navy mission and was awarded competitively on an existing Multiple Award Construction Contract for Dry Utilities. The requirements of this project fit within the scope of work on the Basic Contract.
Summary of Project Scope:
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, in part directs the Government to undertake infrastructure and energy projects, the following project is a result of that legislation. In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest will be adding Solar Photovoltaic Power Systems (SPVPS) to roofs on several bases in the region. The following scope of work is to install SPVPS on 5 buildings that are located at the Naval Air Station Lemoore (NASL) in Lemoore, California. Included in the project is the demolition and replacement of the roof(s) on the buildings to insure their integrity, longevity, and suitability to have the SPVPS installed. The SPVPS should supply power to the building and feed energy back into the power grid if/when there is an excess of electricity produced.

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to proclaim that the Work Assignment Amendment is to obligate a total of $62,178 in Recovery funding to perform this requirement at the site.<br />The site assessment shall consist of the advancement and sampling of up to eight soil borings, and the conversion of the borings to groundwater monitoring wells to further delineate soil and groundwater contamination at this site. Groundwater samples shall be collected from all site monitoring wells that do not have free product present. The site is located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Batesland, South Dakota.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Intent to Sole Source two (2) Month Extension for Operations and Maintenance at the Frederick C. Murphy Federal Records Center, Waltham, MA</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Boston Service Center, Boston, MA intends to issue a sole source contract modification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to extend Contract Number GS-01P-03-BWC-0071 for a two (2) month performance period from Dec 1, 2009 to February 1, 2009. The current contract provides operation and maintenance services for the Frederick C. (FC) Murphy Federal Records Building, 380 Trapelo Road, Waltham, MA 02452. The current contract extension expires November 30, 2009. The Government is in the process of soliciting the mechanical portion, which includes landscaping and snow removal, of this contract. The process is taking longer than anticipated due to changes in requirements, and interest from NISH. Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and new award to ensure continuity of services and support the transition to a new competitive award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Description of the work to be performed: The Contractor shall be responsible to provide all management, supervision, labor, subcontractors, materials, supplies and equipment, and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of all services described within the current contract. The contractor shall be fully responsible for providing all customer service, cleaning, mechanical operations and maintenance, incidental repairs, minor repairs, landscaping and quality control at the FC Murphy Federal Records Center, Waltham, MA. The period of performance will be two (2) months.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide building services to federal agencies in the New England region. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of facilities of this size and complexity by a firm that is familiar with the equipment and hold current security clearances. Northern Management has been performing these services since 2003 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 2-month performance period.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame with, it may give notification via e-mail to Justin Zagorski, Contract Specialist, at justin.zagorski@gsa.gov no later than November 16, 2009, 10:00 a.m., EST. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the requirements.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The USBC is currently located in a leased location in an office building located across from the Will County judiciary complex, which is in the Central Business District (CBD). When the lease commenced in 1999, the building was privately owned; during the term of the lease the building was acquired by Will County. Will County has converted the building to County offices and civil courtrooms. The court needs to be located in close proximity to County offices and services, as well as to be convenient to persons and attorneys appearing in the court. Security, including entry screening, for the existing location is provided by Will County </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">This procurement is for 2,860 rentable square feet of space for a courtroom and chambers for USBC. An ad in FedBizOps in May, 2008, received no replies. A Market Survey conducted in May, 2008, did not identify any locations capable of meeting the requirements of this acquisition. Realty and Customer Service Management provide a market range of $14.00 to $26.00 per rsf for a fully serviced lease, with a mid-point of $20.00. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Although no locations were identified which could meet the requirements of this acquisition, the asking rates for available locations were listed as $14.00 on a non-fully serviced basis; with operating expenses and taxes of approximately $5.50 indicated for these locations, the fully serviced rate would be $19.50.The estimated rent for this space is $18.00 based on discussions with the current Lessor, Will County.. The annual rent would be $51,480.00. Because USBC only uses this space one day a week, USBC has agreed in principal with Will County to allow them to use the space when it is not being used by USBC, with a corresponding reduction in rental. This will result in an annual rent of $10,296.00, at a rate of $3.60 per rsf, fully serviced. The Office of Regional Counsel has agreed in principal to this arrangement, the exact provisions in the lease will be approved by the Office of Regional Counsel. The County is only willing to offer a three year term as they anticipate an increased need for courtrooms bases on the results of the 2010 Census.</span></p>
