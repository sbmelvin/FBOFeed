<CONTACT>Fred Powers Contract Specialist 9169785140     fpowers@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Proposal for a firm-fixed price construction contract to perform construction work at Stony Gorge Dam.  Stony Gorge Dam and Reservoir are part of the Orland Project in Northern California.  The dam is located on Stony Creek, about 20 miles west of Willows, California in Glenn County.  The dam was completed in 1928, with modifications performed in 1985-1986.  Stony Gorge is an ambursen-type dam comprised of 46 bays of slab and buttress construction, with buttresses spaced on 18 feet centers.  The dam has a structural height of 139 feet and crest length of 868 feet at crest elevation 847.0.  Stony Gorge Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure.  The proposed construction work on Stony Gorge consists of a structural modification to address known seismic and hydrologic deficiencies of the dam.  The work incorporates simply supported reinforced concrete diaphragm walls cast between the downstream buttress walls.  Principal components of work:  Diversion of Stony Creek and unwatering; Foundation cleanup; Surface preparation of buttresses for concrete placement; Performing ground penetrating radar survey of buttresses; Drilling holes for rock bolts, anchor bars, and end threaded reinforcing bars and grouting bars in place; Placing reinforced concrete diaphragm walls and struts;  Metal Fabrications; Electrical - (1)  Furnishing and installing electrical conduit, insulated conductors, and grounding system, (2)  Furnishing and installing lighting system, and (3)  Furnishing and installing distribution panel.  The work will require the contractor to job fabricate special forms and material handling systems to meet the restricted access under the downstream portion of the dam.  Some of the work will be performed under the existing spillway slab.  This work has limited access.  Other alternative means for material and equipment access include cutting holes in the reinforced spillway crest slab.  The dam and associated land has limited work, staging and areas.  The contractor will be required to meet various environmental restrictions during performance of the work.  The upstream reservoir water surface will not be lowered for construction purposes.  The dam crest right of the spillway control house is designed for overtopping.  The top of active conservation storage in the reservoir is elevation 841.0.  Release facilities at the dam include a spillway, outlet work and power plant.  The power plant will remain in service during the performance of the work.  The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.  Period of Performance is 1,125 days.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Clause 52.232-18 entitled "Availability of Funds", funds are not presently available for this contract.  The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. This is an unrestricted solicitation and all offers from responsible concerns will be considered.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 "Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns" applies.  NAICS Code is:  237990 and the related small business size standard in millions of dollars is $28.5.  Solicitation 05SP202022 will be posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about July 01, 2005.  The estimated date for receipt of proposals is August 15, 2005.  This requirement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only Coonamessett Farms, 277 Hatchville Road, East Falmouth, MA  02536 on a sole source basis to investigate the behavior of sea turtles around scallop dredges and in areas where scalloping has recently occurred.  This investigation requires the use of underwater cameras to visually identify sea turtle behaviors in and around scallop gear.  The contractor will try to attract turtles by using scallop viscera and scallop fishing activity to observe the turtle behavior relative to the scallop dredge.  The Contractor must utilize a commercial vessel fishing off its limited access Days At Sea under the general category provision of 400 lb daily maximum catch in an area that has reported turtle takes and dense scallop concentrations.  There is a request to National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for an exception from returning to port between trips, a provision of the general category permit.  The vessel must be sufficient in size to safely accommodate the gear and the researchers for this study.  The contractor shall provide Scientific Data Collectors who are readily available and capable of working on commercial fishing vessels.  The Scientific Data Collectors shall be trained in data collection procedures.  This training shall include species identification, subsampling techniques, proper methodology for recording catch, ship and gear data.  The data shall be recorded on National Marine Fisheries Science Center (NMFSC ) approved data sheets.  A final report shall be submitted to NMFSC no later than 30 November 2005.  The final reports shall be delivered electronically in journal format.  The period of performance shall be 01 July 2005 through 30 November 2005.  Gear research and development to reduce sea turtle interactions requires the involvement of experts with experience working cooperatively with industry on the specific fishery and gear type of concern as well as experience utilizing underwater cameras on scallop dredges.  Coonamessett Farms has a history of providing experts for these services.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The applicable NAICS number is 541690; small business size standard is $6 million annually.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide required services.  The solicitation, notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (Fed Biz Opps) site at www.fedbizopps.gov/.

Wind velocities for chemical applications of herbicides must be 10 mph or less in all instances. The Bureau may inspect treatment sites within 10 to 60 days after date of application.  If a random inspection of 10% of the sites does not reflect that 80% of the targeted species have been impacted by herbicides, all listed sites shall be inspected.  If the inspections of all sites reflect an impacted rate of less than 80%, the Contractor shall be required to treat the plants missed at no additional cost to the BLM.  The Bureau has the option of reducing total payment to cover the cost of inspecting all sites and monitoring the treatment of missed plants.  Unpredictable rains within 4 hours can reduce the effectiveness of herbicides and may be an acceptable factor in determining payment.  Contractor will not be reimbursed for spraying done within 5 hours of rain or for travel to and from the site. All work included in the contract specifications shall be subject to inspections by the Government at periodic intervals during the performance of this contract.  Inspections are for the sole benefit of the Government and shall not release the Contractor of the responsibility of providing quality control measures to assure that the work strictly complies with the contract requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Headquarters Division, Patuxent River Maryland intends to procure a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract as a sole source with Honeywell International, Defense and Space Electronic Systems, 9201 San Mateo Boulevard, Albuquerque, NM for the procurement and storage of an estimated quantity of 7,020 Quantum 3D/nVidia graphics processors (P/N: 510-0015-00) for use on the Image Processing Modules (IPMs) in the Type 3 Advanced Mission Computer (AMC).  The IPM Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) provides functionality that commands the 5x5 and 8x10 Advanced Multipurpose Displays (AMPDs).  The nVidia graphics processor is going obsolete and a life of type buy is required to ensure future production as well as retrofit and life cycle support of the AMC.  The items will deliver and ship in place at the contractor's facility, Albuquerque NM, no later than October 2005. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisy agency requirements." Honeywell is the designer and manufacturer of the IPM SRA which is housed in the Type 3 AMC.  The IPM provides a direct video processing capability within the AMC, which drives the functionality of the 5x5, and 8x10   AMPDs, which are also manufactured by Honeywell.  The nVidia graphics processor is a component of the IPM and is the only graphics processor that currently meets AMC&D form, fit, and function requirements. Consequently, Honeywell is best suited to procure these components.  Honeywell fully understands the nVidia chip capabilities and its interface with the AMC&D products.  Further, Honeywell has procurement arrangements with Quantum 3D for the part as well as the capacity and capability to meet its special nitrogen storage requirements.  Procuring the nVidia graphics processors through Honeywell ensures that the parts will be stored appropriately and fully functional when needed. Award of the proposed contract is anticipated to be made on or before October 2005. This is an announcement only regarding a sole source acquisition; there is no solicitation available. While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability to respond to this requirement and may submit information which will be considered by the Naval Air Systems Command. Inquiries may be made or emailed to Ms. Dee Peters at (301) 757-5908 or dee.peters@navy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development & Engineering Command Acquisition Center intends to negotiate solely with Northrop Grumman, Inc., Litton Laser Systems Division (NGLS), Apopka, Florida for redesign of the System Controller circuit card assembly wi thin the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) to address obsolescence and producibility issues and to provide an upgrade path for future improvements to the LLDR System.  The scope of the action will include design activity resulting in a produc tion-ready System Controller, implementation into LLDR Systems for test, and test of the design.  It is anticipated that this action will be a time and materials modification to Delivery Order BM02 issued against Basic Ordering Agreement  N00383-02-G-007A.   The LLDR is a reduced size and weight targeting and designation system.  It provides the Armys Light Forces Forward Observers, Combat Observation and Lasing Teams, and Fire Support Teams with the capability for lightweight target observation, location,  and designation. The LLDR System operates day and night in all weather conditions.  It is modular, weighs 35 pounds and consists of two primary modules: the Target Locator Module (TLM) and the Laser Designator Module (LDM).  The TLM provides target acquis ition, observation, and location functions, as well as mounting and control interfaces for the LDM.  The LDM provides a coded designator signal that is used to highlight a target for destruction by laser-guided precision munitions.  The design of the LLDR system is proprietary to Litton Laser Systems, Apopka, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Corporation.  Litton Laser Systems (Litton) and the Government does not possess detailed technical data for this item.  No other source can provid e an LLDR system that meets the Governments requirements without duplication of development, testing and manufacturing facility or without exceeding the required delivery date of April 2007.  Offerors who can demonstrate they can meet the Governments req uirement will be considered for award.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for the development of a high efficiency, high power (5W) continuous wave amplifier at a nominal frequency of 220 GHz.  The amplifier shall be as compact as possible and shall operate at as low a cathode voltage as possible, consistent with good beam transport and minimal body current.  As a goal, it is desired that the power amplifier tube will occupy not more than approximately 1200cm3 (exclusive of power supply), and that the cathode voltage will be not less than 3 kV and not more than 20 kV.  An additional goal is to achieve an efficiency factor for this amplifier of at least 25%.  It is anticipated that this effort will be conducted in three phases.  The first phase would involve conducting a design study to evaluate optimum circuit design, evaluate cathode voltage/current and magnetic focusing trade-offs, evaluate the predicted performance of the proposed amplifier, both with and without a depressed collector, and to evaluate the potential to increase the operating bandwidth beyond 400 MHz by altering the baseline design.  This phase will also involve developing a complete thermal, mechanical, and electrical design for the amplifier to be developed in the second phase of the effort.  It is anticipated that this phase will have a period of performance of approximately 6 months.  The second phase of the effort would involve performing amplifier builds to the design developed in the first phase.  This phase would emphasize basic power bandwidth performance. At the conclusion of the second phase, the contractor is required to demonstrate amplifier performance initially at their facility and subsequently at NRL, using the NRL test modulator model ETM Model 2062PD2 (20 kV max voltage, 1 A max current, 100% duty, 4 stage depressed collector capability). The anticipated period of performance for this phase is one year.  The third phase of the effort involves further development of the amplifier developed in the second phase, focusing on achieving the efficiency goal by integrating a multi-stage depressed collector.  This phase involves the development of the amplifier with a depressed collector following demonstration of the power, gain, and bandwidth performance of the amplifier with a simple collector in the second phase.  As with the second phase, at the conclusion of the third phase, the contractor is required to demonstrate amplifier performance initially at their facility and subsequently at NRL, using the NRL test modulator described previously.  It is also anticipated that this phase will have a one year period of performance. This procurement will also contain two option items.  The first option item is for the development of a beam stick (gun, magnetic focusing, multi-stage depressed collector).  If exercised, this option would be exercised at the beginning of the third phase, due to design considerations.  The second option, if exercised, would involve delivery of an additional high power, high efficiency, amplifier of the same configuration developed under the third phase. 

NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  This solicitation and other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/listrfp.htm
The response date published in this synopsis is the current estimated closing date. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued. See Numbered Note(s) 25 and 26.

H-60, H-60, and VH-60.  The primary role of the EW Suite is to enhance the survivability and mission effectiveness of tactical aircraft through situational awareness and countermeasures.  Each year brings new challenges to the EW suite in the form of new and/or modified threat weapon systems.  The EW Support Equipment Team is tasked with developing the EW Suite Diagnostics Systems.   This mission-oriented software requires updates on a regular basis as a result of the highly dynamic tactical and strategic environments.  Currently, the U.S. Navy is fielding, jointly with the U.S. Air Force, a new generation of EW diagnostics equipment centered on the AN/USM-670 JSECST.  Major task requirements to be accomplished include TPS Software Development; USM-670 JSECST Technical Support; Electronic Warfare Support Equipment Prototype Development, Fabrication and Testing; Integrated Logistics Support Technical Documentation; and Test Set Low-Rate Initial Production Procurement (USM-670!

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one (1) Picometrix Terahertz (THz) transmitter and receiver pair. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Picometrix Inc.  The THZ heads must be compatible with the Picometrix system that Marshall Space Flight Center currently has on site, and be able to directly integrate without any system modifications. The THZ transmitter and receiver are direct replacements for the pair that were used to build the collinear head. The certification of THZ for use on the External Tank Spray-on-Foam Insulation will require that Marshall Space Flight Center conduct tests which must be accomplished with equipment of the same make and model to that used on the production floor at the Michoud Assembly Facility.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Portable Digital Real-Time Radiography System. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the system from HYTEC Sensors and Imaging Group, Inc., Los Alamos, NM, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The components of the proposed portable digital radiography system (detector, control computer, and image capture and control software) must be compatible with MSFC's existing HYTEC computed tomography/digital radiography inspection system to allow interchange of components and data when required.  Other systems cannot duplicate the HYTEC software functionality or image output file format without violating copyright law and licensing agreements between HYTEC and MSFC.  File formats generated by systems built by other sources are incompatible with datasets already collected at MSFC using HYTEC hardware and software as part of ongoing research into materials characteristics of flight hardware component materials. 2.  Preliminary field real-time radiographic testing has been performed on various motor and test components using components of another HYTEC inspection system owned by MSFC.  The inspection method has been successfully qualified for field operations using the HYTEC hardware and software, which is identical in performance and operating procedures to the proposed system.  The software installed as part of the digital radiography system is proprietary and can only be procured from HYTEC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 24, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13.106 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-05-00234 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  This procurement  is being solicited on a total small business set-aside basis.  The NAICS and small business size standard for this project are 541620/$6.0 million.  Only one award will result from this solicitation, via the issuance of a time and materials purchase order. STATEMENT OF WORK:  Assessment of How to  Increase the Demand for Home Performance with ENERGY STAR in the Affordable Housing Market.  In 1992 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) introduced the ENERGY STAR label to identify and promote energy efficient products that exceed minimum efficiency requirements.  ENERGY STAR is a  partnership between EPA, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the manufacturers, distributors and vendors of high quality, energy efficient products.  The overall goal of the Program is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants by offering consumers the opportunity to purchase  equipment that meets their needs and saves energy.  The ENERGY STAR label is now on major appliances, heating and cooling equipment, windows, lighting, and more to include over 40 product categories.  EPA has also extended the label to cover new homes and commercial and industrial buildings.   Through its partnerships with more than 8,000 private and public sector organizations, ENERGY STAR delivers the technical information and tools that organizations and consumers need to choose efficient solutions and best management practices.  ENERGY STAR has successfully delivered cost savings  across the country, saving businesses, organizations and consumers more than $8 billion a year.	One of the market segments that ENERGY STAR has not historically addressed, but one that stands to gain the most from the energy savings attained from using ENERGY STAR-labeled products and practices, is  the affordable housing market.  This market faces its own set of challenges and barriers to increasing the use of energy efficient products and practices, which are often more difficult to address than those faced in the traditional market.  For example, low-income homeowners, because of the sheer  demand on their time just to make ends meet, lack of education, or both, find it exceedingly difficult to find information and implement measures to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.  And with energy costs comprising an increasing share of household income, low-income homeowners and  renters are finding it difficult to pay for even basic living necessities.  Now that ENERGY STAR has achieved prominence in the traditional market, affordable housing advocates are looking to ENERGY STAR for energy-saving solutions.  EPA would like to expand its work on ENERGY STAR to address the  needs of the affordable housing market and increase the energy saving and pollution reduction potential of ENERGY STAR.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this work is to provide the Residential Branch of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Protection Partnerships Division with a study on how  Home Performance with ENERGY STAR could be implemented in the affordable housing market.  The overall goal of the project is to increase the demand for home performance with ENERGY STAR by expanding into the affordable housing market via existing initiatives and other affordable housing programs.   EPA also wants to gain a greater understanding of how the affordable housing market (existing housing, single family, owner-occupied) works, including how foundations are thinking about the affordable housing market.  This project will be conducted in two phases.  In Phase I, the Contractor shall  develop a detailed plan of how Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Pilots could be implemented.  EPA's sites of preference for the Pilots are New York and Wisconsin.  In Phase II, the Contractor shall work with at least two pilot sites to demonstrate Home Performance with ENERGY STAR and produce a  final report providing a detailed analysis of the performance of the pilots and a broader discussion of how Home Performance with ENERGY STAR could be implemented in the affordable housing market.  Phase 1:  Developing a Plan of How a Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Pilot Could be Implemented in  New York and Wisconsin.  In this phase of the project, the Contractor shall:  Task 1:  Conduct a stakeholder meeting (or several, if necessary, to include the Ford Foundation) with stakeholders to include weatherization agencies, local home rehabilitation agencies, foundations, utilities, Public  Utility Commissions (PUC's), churches, and other community groups.  Task 2:  Identify key champions in target areas -New York and Wisconsin.  Task 3:  Assess the key champion's ability to perform quality control in the target areas.  Task 4:  Develop a detailed plan of how a Home Performance with  ENERGY STAR Pilot could be implemented using existing Home Performance with ENERGY STAR infrastructure in New York and Wisconsin.  Initial issues to work out in Phase I include: 1) What are the value added components of Home Performance as compared to some of the more extensive weatherization  programs that are operating in states like Wisconsin and Massachusetts? 2) What additional certification requirements would weatherization contractors have to meet?  Are some of them meeting them already but have not formally applied for certification? 3) What resources are available?  What are the  added costs, if any, under the current programs?  For some, would it be a matter of approach, with no additional costs?  Are some already accomplishing the same goals, but just using different terms? 4) Are Home Performance contractors willing to work with the Contractor? 5) Can existing  contractors be trained in Home Performance?  We don't want to create a special certification that just adds costs but no value.  What is the difference between a regular contractor who is skilled at including energy efficiency as part of the job and one that is certified? 6) Will state and local  governments that run affordable housing programs consider including Home Performance as part of their rehabilitation/construction criteria? 7) What is the current situation and opportunity for development?  Phase II:  Implement Home Performance Pilots in New York and Wisconsin and Develop Final  Report.  Upon approval of EPA of the implementation plan developed in Phase I, the Contractor shall implement the Home Performance Pilots.  Work under Phase II shall include:  Task 5:  Progress meeting(s) with stakeholders.  Task 6:  A final report, which shall include metrics not limited to:  Number of Home Performance jobs performed; Measures implemented; How the jobs were paid for; The average cost per job; The Contractor's perspective on how jobs worked or didn't work for them; The impact on the agency's performance; The consumer's perspective - lower utility bills? Greater comfort?   Satisfaction with the contractor (timeliness, quality of work)?; A broader discussion of how Home Performance with ENERGY STAR could be implemented in the affordable housing market, including current benefits, barriers to overcome, and how Home Performance with ENERGY STAR should be implemented as  a matter of policy in the affordable housing market and how a program should be structured. Schedule of Deliverables:  Task 1.  Conduct meeting - 10 weeks after receipt of TO. Tasks 2 & 3.  Memo identifying stakeholders and assessing their ability to perform quality control - 8 weeks after receipt  of TO.  Task 4:  Detailed Implementation Plan - 12 weeks after receipt of TO.  Task 5:  Progress meeting with stakeholders - 28 weeks after receipt of TO and 48 weeks after receipt of TO. Task 6:  Final Report - 72 weeks (18 months) after receipt of TO.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Date of award  through eighteen (18) months.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  The Government will make award to the responsive, responsible firm, whose quotation is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This is a best-value procurement.  The Government may or may not award to the low price  quotation.  Technical merit is considered to be of greater importance than price.  The Government will utilize the evaluation criteria identified below, listed in descending order of importance, during the evaluation of responses received to this Request for Quotation.  1.  Technical Merit-The  Government will evaluate the offeror's technical approach and the level of knowledge of working with low-income homeowners to sustain their homeownership by, among other things, improving the energy efficiency of their home.  Knowledge of how to work with Foundations and of developing holistic  solutions to helping low-income families preserve their home by integrating energy, housing, finance and related social programs is critical. Knowledge of how to form partnerships with other programs and organizations to provide funding and technical assistance is also critical.  EPA will evaluate  the uniqueness of the offeror's approach and is particularly interested in approaches that consolidate a low-income homeowner's information and support sources through one point of contact--for example, a social worker.  2.  Past Performance/Experience-The Government will evaluate the offeror's  demonstrated experience relevant to each task.  This includes current experience (within last year) bringing federal, state and local partners including government agencies, Foundations, banks, and others to work together at the local level to help support the development of and implementation of  programs to sustain low-income homeownership.

PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES/ SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION/CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, INTENDS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO JOHNSON INSTITUTE.  
CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 30, 2005.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:

BACKGROUND

THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NATIONS FAITH-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH ALL THE COLLABORATIVE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND TREATMENT AS MANDATED BY H.R. 4923.  THIS CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN JANUARY 2001, AND THE PRESIDENT'S FAITH INITIATIVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT RECOVERY GRANTS ISSUED IN JUNE 2004, AUTHORIZED BY SECTIONS 501(D) (5) AND 509 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, AS AMENDED AND THE SECRETARY OF D.H.H.S, MIKE LEAVITT, 500 DAY PLAN ISSUED MAY 2005, CREATES A COMPELLING NEED TO PRODUCE THIS PROCUREMENT IN THE TIME FRAME INDICATED.

ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE AMONG AND SOCIETY'S MOST PERVASIVE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL CONCERNS.  INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. HISTORICALLY, GRASSROOTS FAITH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RESPONDED TO THESE ISSUES OPERATING ON SHOESTRING BUDGETS AND WITHOUT FEDERAL, LOCAL AND STATE SUPPORT.  SINCE 1992, SAMHSA HAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND SUPPORTED FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.    IN JANUARY 2001, PRESIDENT GEORGE W.

CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 30, 2005.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:

BACKGROUND

THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NATIONS FAITH-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH ALL THE COLLABORATIVE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND TREATMENT AS MANDATED BY H.R. 4923.  THIS CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN JANUARY 2001, AND THE PRESIDENT'S FAITH INITIATIVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT RECOVERY GRANTS ISSUED IN JUNE 2004, AUTHORIZED BY SECTIONS 501(D) (5) AND 509 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, AS AMEND AND THE SECRETARY OF D.H.H.S, 500 DAY PLAN ISSUED MAY 2005 THAT IDENTIFIES, " FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ARE GIVEN EQUAL ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT GRANTS", AND "INCREASING THE COMMITMENT TO FAITH AD COMMUNITY-BASED GRANTS, INCLUDING ATR", CREATES A COMPELLING NEED TO PRODUCE THIS PROCUREMENT IN THE TIME FRAME INDICATED.

ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE AMONG AND SOCIETY'S MOST PERVASIVE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL CONCERNS.  INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. HISTORICALLY, GRASSROOTS FAITH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RESPONDED TO THESE ISSUES OPERATING ON SHOESTRING BUDGETS AND WITHOUT FEDERAL, LOCAL AND STATE SUPPORT.  SINCE 1992, SAMHSA HAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND SUPPORTED FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.    IN JANUARY 2001, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH EXPANDED THE 1996 CHARITABLE CHOICE LEGISLATION ENACTED UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES HHS AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE REGULATORY AND PROGRAMMATIC BARRIERS THAT WOULD PREVENT FAITH BASED AND GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FROM APPLYING FOR AND SUCCESSFULLY RECEIVING FEDERAL GRANTS OR CONTRACTS, AND THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF SERVICES IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BENEFITED FROM THIS TRAINING AND AS A RESULT HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GRANTS. WHILE THIS IS THE CASE, MANY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY SUCCESSFULLY APPLYING FOR FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS BECAUSE OF SUCH REASONS AS WEAK INFRASTRUCTURES, INADEQUATE CAPACITY TO DELIVER SERVICES, AND THE LACK OF COLLABORATIVE SUPPORTS AND PARTNERSHIPS. 

BECAUSE OF THIS, SAMHSA'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FY 2005 WILL FOCUS ON ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEMONSTRATE OPERATIONAL READINESS TO DELIVER QUALITY TREATMENT AND RECOVERY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY FOR SAMHSA GRANT AWARDS.  OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, COMMITTED CARING FAITH COMMUNITIES HAS BECOME ONE OF THE NATION'S FINEST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS AND HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS CAPACITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TRAINING IN EXCESS OF 3500 FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED INDIVIDUALS.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

COMMITTED CARING FAITH COMMUNITIES IS A NATIONAL NETWORK OF FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NETWORKS COMMITTED TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE POOR AND INCREASING THE CAPACITY AMONG FAITH AND COMMUNITY  BASED ORGANIZATIONS SERVING THOSE IN NEED.  CCFC IS COMPRISED OF SEASONED PROFESSIONAL WITH SKILLS IN GRANT WRITING, GRANT MANAGEMENT, VOLUNTEER MOBILIZATION, NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, COALITION DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY.    

COMMITTED CARING FAITH COMMUNITIES (CCFC) IS AN INTERFAITH, CROSS-DENOMINATIONAL FAITH-BASED STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED DECEMBER 7, 1995 EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION INTERESTED IN PROVIDING SERVICES IN THE AREA OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  UNLIKE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE, CCFC DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICE TO ADDICTED FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS, BUT RATHER SERVES MEMBERS OF FAITH AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO IN TURN PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO ADDICTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, CCFC, WHICH BEGAN UNDER THE TARGET CITIES INITIATIVE, HAS COORDINATED REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONFERENCES THAT HAVE ATTRACTED FAITH ORGANIZATIONS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; THE REPUBLIC OF PALAU IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ALASKA.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE PROVIDED ONE-ON-ONE CAPACITY BUILDING, COALITION BUILDING, STRATEGIC PLANNING, AND ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO FAITH AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF MISSOURI AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.   

CCFC IS THE ONLY FAITH INITIATIVE THAT STARTED UNDER THE TARGET CITIES PROGRAM IN THE MID 1990'S THAT HAS SUSTAINED ITSELF.  CCFC'S ONGOING CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY IN MISSOURI IN CHARGE OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG ABUSE SERVICE'S, PUTS IT IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO CREATE DIALOGUE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE FAITH COMMUNITY.  CCFC IS OPERATED BY A WORKING, VOLUNTEER BOARD OF DIRECTORS FROM THE JEWISH, METHODIST, LUTHERAN, SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST, CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY, AND BAPTIST TRADITIONS.
COLLECTIVELY, BOARD MEMBERS POSSESS EXPERTISE IN COALITION BUILDING, SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION, SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT, HIV/AIDS, CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS, STRATEGIC PLANNING, BOARD DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND MARKETING, COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, PROJECT MANAGEMENT, AND FAITH-BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT.  IN 2002, CCFC PILOTED A 32-HOUR COURSE ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOR THE FAITH COMMUNITY CALLED THE ADDICTIONS ACADEMY.  TO DATE, 363 INDIVIDUALS HAVE GRADUATED FROM THE ACADEMY WHICH HAS BEEN REPLICATED IN CINCINNATI, OHIO.  THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY USES THE ADDICTIONS ACADEMY TO TRAIN FAITH-BASED AND NON-TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING IN MISSOURI'S ACCESS TO RECOVERY GRANT. IN ADDITION, IN 2002, CCFC ESTABLISHED THE MISSOURI FAITH COMMUNITY SUBSTANCE ABUSE RESOURCE NETWORK, WHICH IS A STATEWIDE GROUP MADE UP OF PEOPLE FROM THE FAITH COMMUNITY INTERESTED IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND RECOVERY.   

COMMITTED CARING FAITH COMMUNITIES IS THE ONLY VENDOR WITH THE SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, AND CULTURALLY COMPETENCE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE IN THIS TIME FRAME.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

DATE: JUNE 16, 2005

REQUISITION NO: 05M000118

INTENDED SOURCE:  AMERICAN INDIAN TRAINING INSTITUTE
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH ONE YEAR

CLOSING DATE IS JUNE 30, 2005.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:


BACKGROUND

THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NATIONS FAITH-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH ALL THE COLLABORATIVE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND TREATMENT AS MANDATED BY H.R. 4923.  THIS CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN JANUARY 2001, AND THE PRESIDENT'S FAITH INITIATIVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT RECOVERY GRANTS, ISSUED IN JUNE 2004 AUTHORIZED BY SECTIONS 501(D) (5) AND 509 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, AS AMENDED AND THE SECRETARY OF D.H.H.S, MIKE LEAVITT, 500 DAY PLAN ISSUED MAY 2005 THAT IDENTIFIES, " FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ARE GIVEN EQUAL ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT GRANTS", AND "INCREASING THE COMMITMENT TO FAITH AND COMMUNITY-BASED GRANTS, INCLUDING ATR.", CREATES A COMPELLING NEED TO PRODUCE THIS PROCUREMENT IN THE TIME FRAME INDICATED.

ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE AMONG AND SOCIETY'S MOST PERVASIVE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL CONCERNS.  INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. HISTORICALLY, GRASSROOTS FAITH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RESPONDED TO THESE ISSUES OPERATING ON SHOESTRING BUDGETS AND WITHOUT FEDERAL, LOCAL AND STATE SUPPORT.  SINCE 1992, SAMHSA HAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED AND SUPPORTED FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.  IN JANUARY 2001, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, WHICH EXPANDED THE 1996 CHARITABLE CHOICE LEGISLATION ENACTED UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES HHS AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE REGULATORY AND PROGRAMMATIC BARRIERS THAT WOULD PREVENT FAITH BASED AND GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FROM APPLYING FOR AND SUCCESSFULLY RECEIVING FEDERAL GRANTS OR CONTRACTS, AND THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF SERVICES IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES.  

IN 2000 THE SAMHSA HAD UNDERTAKEN A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE TO ASSIST GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF WRITING SUCCESSFUL FEDERAL GRANTS AND ENHANCING TREATMENT AND PREVENTION SERVICE DELIVERY. FROM 2001-2004, SAMHSA HAS PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OVER 6500 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING FAITH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND HAS COLLABORATED WITH COMMUNITY INTERMEDIARY ORGANIZATIONS TO FACILITATE THESE ACTIVITIES. FAITH AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BENEFITED FROM THIS TRAINING AND AS A RESULT HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GRANTS. WHILE THIS IS THE CASE, MANY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY   SUCCESSFULLY APPLYING FOR FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS BECAUSE OF SUCH REASONS AS WEAK INFRASTRUCTURES, INADEQUATE CAPACITY TO DELIVER SERVICES, AND THE LACK OF COLLABORATIVE SUPPORTS AND PARTNERSHIPS. 

BECAUSE OF THIS, SAMHSA'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FY 2005 WILL FOCUS ON ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEMONSTRATE OPERATIONAL READINESS TO DELIVER QUALITY TREATMENT AND RECOVERY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY FOR SAMHSA GRANT AWARDS.  

PURPOSE

THE GOAL OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 IS ASSIST FAITH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WITH SUCCESSFULLY COMPETING FOR SAMHSA GRANTS AWARDS.

<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends on issuing a sole source six-month interim contract to ICF Incorporated, 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031 to provide transition support and continuity of services for the Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program until a competitively awarded contract is in-place. 
Contractor support is needed to provide exercise, programmatic, technical, and administrative support during a transition period to allow FEMA to meet its Congressional mandate in implementing the REP program.  This mandate is to provide the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public living around commercial nuclear power plants is being maintained. ICF is the incumbent contractor for the REP program.  ICF’s current contract EME-2001-CO-0001 expires September 30, 2005.  However, the solicitation and award of the follow-on REP contract has been delayed due to FEMA’s response and recovery measures undertaken for hurricanes Jeanne, Ivan, Frances, and Charley.  A six-month interim contract will be awarded to ICF to provide transition support and continuity of services until a five-year contract (inclusive of options) is awarded for the REP program on a competitive basis.  Continued contract support is needed from October 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006 to allow sufficient time for the successful contractor under the follow-on contract to complete mandatory FEMA evaluator training and assume full exercise support responsibilities. Contractor duties required during the six-month transition period include: i) providing  REP offsite exercise support in accordance with the Standard Exercise Report Format (SERF), 44 CFR 350-344, site specific plans, and other REP related regulations, policies, and procedures; ii) providing administrative support for REP exercise & drills; iii) providing expert guidance on the review of REP offsite plans pursuant to FEMA rule 44 CFR Part 350; iv) providing REP policy guidance on offsite REP preparedness in accordance with NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1; v) providing expert technical guidance for REP health physics support of the planning elements in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1; and vi) providing REP cost accounting in accordance with 44 CFR Part 354 to track REP costs for assessment of user fees on NRC licenses of commercial nuclear power plants. The required contract support during the transition support is extensive.  FEMA is responsible for the evaluation of 30 to 35 exercises of site-specific offsite radiological emergency preparedness plans annually and an additional 10 to 20 remedial drills. About 60 to 100 additional medical, rehearsal and other out-of sequence drills are also evaluated per year.  ICF is currently required to maintain pool of 130 evaluators with appropriate ranges of technical expertise to ensure that staffing requirements for exercises can be met at any given time. Full scale REP exercises may require up to 50 or more contractor evaluators per exercise. Concurrent full scale exercises (in separate FEMA Regions) are anticipated.  There are currently 13 REP exercise scheduled during the transition period. Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the Contracting Officer has determined that ICF is the only known source that possesses the required staffing, resources, and experience to provide the needed REP services during the six-month transition period.  ICF is the only known source that has the requisite staffing of fully qualified REP exercise evaluators that have completed the mandatory FEMA training.  Any other contractor would have to recruit and train a pool of evaluators sufficient to meet the scheduled exercises during the transition period. Any other contractor would also have to obtain the mandatory FEMA provided on-the-job and classroom training for their proposed evaluators. All REP evaluators must successfully complete on-the-job training by performing evaluator duties under the surveillance of a FEMA evaluator at one FEMA-graded REP exercise and complete the REP Evaluator Course, REP Planning Course, and the REP Accident Assessment Course prior serving as an evaluator.  The contractor will also be required to develop and implement a comprehensive organization conflict of interest (OCI) plan to ensure no proposed evaluators pose a conflict of interest to exercise findings. The contractor is also required to develop and use an on-line work order tracking system to track costs necessary to assess user fees from NRC licenses of commercial nuclear power plants. ICF already has an OCI plan and an on-line work order tracking system in-place that can be used during the transition period. FEMA anticipates releasing a competitive request for proposal (RFP) for these services during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 with estimated award in November 2005. Offerors interested in this requirement will have an opportunity to submit a proposal for the follow-on requirement once the RFP is issued. No solicitation documentation exists.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Capability statements are due by June 30, 2005.

<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends on issuing a sole source contract modification under EME-2001-CO-0001 with ICF Incorporated, 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031 to increase the level of effort for the period of approximately July 1, 2005 though September 30, 2005 for increased Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) exercise support.  The subject contract includes a tasking to provide REP offsite exercise support in accordance with the Standard Exercise Report Format (SERF), 44 CFR 350-344, site specific plans, and other REP related regulations, policies, and procedures.  This contractor support is needed to ensure FEMA can accomplish its Congressional mandate to provide the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public living around commercial nuclear power plants is being maintained. In meeting this mandate FEMA conducts evaluations of 30 to 35 exercises of site-specific offsite radiological emergency preparedness plans annually and an additional 10 to 20 remedial drills. About 60 to 100 additional medical, rehearsal and other out-of sequence drills are also evaluated per year. Full scale REP exercises may require up to 50 or more contractor evaluators per exercise. Concurrent full scale exercises (in separate FEMA Regions) are anticipated. Contractor provided evaluators are needed due shortfalls in available Federal evaluators.  There is a need to increase the current level of effort of contractor provided exercise support since other Federal departments and agencies that assist with exercises have reduced the level of REP evaluator support provided to FEMA due to budgetary constraints and competing priorities. This increased level of support is for approximately for 4,000 to 4,500 of additional exercise evaluator hours during the period of July 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005.  

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the Contracting Officer has determined that ICF is the only known source that possesses the required staffing, resources, and experience to provide the additional level of support through September 30, 2005.  ICF is the only known source that has the requisite staffing of fully qualified REP exercise evaluators that have completed the mandatory FEMA training.  Any other contractor would have to recruit and train a pool of evaluators sufficient to meet the scheduled exercises during this period. ICF is currently required to maintain pool of 130 evaluators with appropriate ranges of technical expertise to ensure that staffing requirements for exercises can be met at any given time.

The contractor is also required to develop and use an on-line work order tracking system to track costs necessary to assess user fees from NRC licenses of commercial nuclear power plants. ICF already has an OCI plan and an on-line work order tracking system in-place that can be used for the scope of this modification.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Requires a contractor to facilitate collaborative research among scientists and stakeholders.  The contractor will involve a variety of groups and agencies to conduct a Request for Proposals process that will solicit research, education and outreach activities that involve stakeholders. The period of performance is July 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005

BACKGROUND

In April 2003 the California Department of Fish and Game implemented a new network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in state waters within the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.  The ongoing management of these MPAs requires monitoring of biological changes in areas that are within, nearby and distant from the MPAs.  The California Department of Fish and Game and CINMS, with input from representatives from recreational and commercial fisheries, the scientific community, conservation groups, government agencies and the general public, has developed a set of monitoring recommendations for the new MPAs.  These recommendations include involving stakeholders in collaborative research that provides scientific data needed to evaluate MPAs.  Projects are needed that will involve stakeholders in collecting information on commercially and/or recreationally valuable species in the Channel Islands region.
A program to facilitate stakeholder involvement in collaborative research was developed by the Channel Islands Sanctuary Foundation (CISF).  The CISF, a 501(c)3 organization, was established to support the management, research and educational goals of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.  The CISF created an innovative program of collaborative resource assessment, research and protection called the Collaborative Marine Research Program (CMRP).  The CMRP is based on a partnership of local marine researchers, commercial fishers and the regional resource management agencies (National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), Channel Islands National Park (CINP) and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).  This partnership investigates resource management questions of interest to the participants.  Fishermen participate in a variety of program roles including project selection, as paid researchers and other appropriate roles.  The program simultaneously collects needed resource information in a cost-effective manner and builds excellent relations between marine stakeholders.

<DESC>The following information is hereby incorporated, in its entirety, into the combined synopsis/solicitation:   A listing of all  employees/consultants proposed to work on this project shall be identified  in the quote.  All employees/consultants of a company proposed to work on  the project for this contract shall have a favorable security  clearance/background investigation within 75 days after the effective date  of the contract award.    However, all employees/consultants proposed to  work on the project shall have at a minimum, a favorable screening within  20 days after the effective date of the contract award.   The paperwork to  initiate the security clearance/background investigation shall be  submitted to the Government within 24 hours after contract award to the  BIA, OIEP, Security Office in order to begin the background investigation.    All costs associated with the background investigation shall be the  responsibility of the Government.   The following Background Investigation  Clause is hereby provided in its entirety:  BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS  Clause.  In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child  Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime  Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and  Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities  involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject  to a background investigation and determination of suitability for  employment.  Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening  (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel  Security and Suitability Program; and, a favorable background  investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM).  A favorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of  Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability  Program prior to contract award or made within 75 days of incorporation of  this clause into a current/exiting contract.  Pending completion of a  background investigation by OPM, the contractor who has been granted a  favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be  within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who  has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C. 13041 (3)) during  contract performance until a final background investigation determination  has been made.  Prior employment with the Federal Government, including  BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the  appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate  or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination or background investigation.    Prior to contract award or  during the 75 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the  company, individual or contractor’s responsibility to contact the BIA,  OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at (505)  248-6938/6939/6940/6383 in order to obtain a complete security package,  which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms  and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening  (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background  investigation.   If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination is made, a contract shall not be awarded to the individual  who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed  to employ the individual to perform the work.   The individual and or the  company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be  non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination is made, which will make them ineligible for contract award.   If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made,  the contract may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be  authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the service involves  contact with or regular control over Indian children.   All other terms  and conditions shall remain in full force and effect.

This sources sought announcement for the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) is seeking market information on businesses/organizations capable of providing literature review, interviews and site visits.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6 million average annual receipt for the preceding three fiscal years. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the NCI to identify capable potential sources.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if there are at least two potential small businesses who are capable of performing this effort. The responses to this notice may also serve as a means to arrive at the most suitable approach to acquiring, distributing, and supporting the planned effort.  If this acquisition is determined to be reserved for small business, the Government will use the information gathered from this Sources Sought Synopsis to help identify small business firms participating in this market.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), may enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients cancer whose care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.

<DESC>DRY SUPPORT BRIDGE (DSB) MARKET SURVEY Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a DSB Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program.  IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deplo yment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.    Under this PBL contract, the contractor will be responsible for a large portion of the DSB logistics support, such as supply chain management and all scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance.  The Army will retain responsibility for the DSB s unscheduled field maintenance.  Operator and maintenance training (including both new equipment training and sustainment training) will be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the warfighter.  In addition , the contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 5 years.   Goal: Ultimate goal is ultra-availability (readiness).  Our goal is to structure a contract, which will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  Operational readiness 90% or better.  Reduced logistics footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Operational Readiness -  90 percent or better.  Launcher vehicle starts and complete bridging mission every time. Reduced Logistics Footprint  Measurable reduction in number of tools required  (special and common).  Measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair   and troubleshooting tasks.  Measurable reduction of training required.  PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE Name of Firm Address City, State Zip Code Point of Contact Name Telephone Number Email Address Website Address 1. What would be your business approach to meeting these responsibilities for managing the DSB fleet? 2. How would you propose meeting the goal of ultra-availability? 3. What potential constraints or boundaries do you see with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 4. How do you see the government measuring these specific areas for obtaining supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?  What suggestions might you have? 5. What would you recommend as the approach to supply chain management in support of the DSB fleet? 6. How would you approach performance of sustainment maintenance and reduce vehicle maintenance, both scheduled and unscheduled? 7. How would you approach operator/maintainer training and reduce training needs? 8. Would you be willing to provide this type of support under a long-term contract? 9. What would you do differently in support of deployment contingency (wartime vs peacetime) operations? 10. How do you foresee the target price for a fixed level of PBL to be set up?  What would a fair payment plan/schedule consist of and how could it be linked to successful performance?

APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).  PBL is: "	Buying results not resources "	Using performance specs not design specs "	Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a predetermined course of action. "	About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, Gener al Support, and Depot maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE DSB BASIC FACTS:  1.	SYSTEM:  Dry Support Bridge (DSB). 2.	OEM: Williams Fairey Engineering Limited (WFEL).  Only one configuration. 3.	SYSTEM CONFIGURATION: Army does not own TDP.  DSB was procured to a detailed performance specification (ATPD 2282).  Configur ation is frozen. 4.	FLEET ASSESSMENT:  See document at end of Appendix B for density, location of assets, fielding, and production information.  Still in production.  Expected Useful Life is 20 years. 5.	ARMY TRANSFORMATION IMPACT.  The DSB will not be impacted by modularity.  This bridge is part of the Multi-Role Bridging Companies, providing the maneuver commanders with greater flexibility and mobility on the battlefield by enhancing their capability to cross dry gaps up to 40 meters.  It replaces the medium grider bridge in the US Army inventory. Scope of PBL:  PBL is for basic system with no add-ons at this time. Expected Workload: "	Sustainment level:  Two level maintenance: sustainment and field. "	Parts support:  Repair parts contract for reparable items, nonreparable items supported by DLA.  "	TPF (Palletized Load System trailers and Common Bridge Transporter) already in place before DSB fieldings "	NET and sustainment training provided by OEM contractor, options in contract for increased training "	DSB still under warranty for one year after handoff "	Any hardware modifications done through ECP "	Armor Installation: NA "	Request proposal for both peacetime and wartime scenarios. System Op Mode Summary:  DSB is a tactical bridge system, used primarily to ensure the mobility of combat support vehicles, soldiers, and supplies.  It is designed to be emplaced only for short durations, not as permanent infrastructure, to accommodate mil itary traffic up to MLC 80T/100W.   It can be used in all environments.     Annual usage. Annual Wartime Operational Mode = 1008 hours per year. Annual Peacetime Operational Mode = 2256 hours per year. Reliability:  For the DSB the reliability is 11 mean cycles between mission abort at an 80 percent level of confidence.  Maintenance ratio: Bridge = 0.0071 and Launcher Vehicle = 0.4340 Annual Sustainment Costs:  DSB system has not been fielded long enough to develop sustainment cost data. Current Organic Support:  The DSB is supported via DLA direct vendor delivery parts support contract at this time.  The repair contract between PSID and WFEL is currently in development.  The Armys Two Level maintenance strategy is already in place for th e DSB.  Training is provided by contractor, as well as any follow-on or sustainment training.  Fielding and equipment handoff is conducted by OEM and other contractors. Maintenance Support: The Armys Two Level maintenance is already in place. Depot Capability:  For the DSB, there are no depot efforts in any worldwide locations; the program is Depot exempt. Labor Hour Estimates: The labor hour estimates are shown on the Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) for the DSB.  The MAC is available upon request. Field Data: Currently, there is no Sample Data Collection (SDC) effort underway (low density bridge system) System Improvements: Expected performance results from the PBL provider is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to a greater reliability, greater availability, a reduced logistics footprint, reduced scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, and reduced maintenance/repair times, and ultimately reduced O&S costs to the Army.

The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to provide high fidelity products, computer simulations, and information including detailed GPS performance assessments tailored specifically for the use of DoD and theater warfighting forces in support of the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (2 SOPS), Global Positioning System Operations Center (GPSOC) under Air Force Space Command, 50th Space Wing.  
 
These products are intended as decision-making tools in the operational planning and execution process.  The GSC shall provide monitoring of the performance of the GPS constellation and its constituent subsystems.  The GSC shall respond to DoD, United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Control Center (NOCC) problem reports and requests for information, and coordinate the collection, analysis, and distribution of information related to all GPS related anomalies on behalf of the 50 SW.  
 
Description of Action:  

The 50th Space Wing (50 SW) intends to acquire on-site technical GPS satellite communications support services for the GPS Operations Center (GPSOC).  The GPSOC concept brings together in one organization all of the expertise, data fusion and visualization capabilities, security clearances, and performance information required to maintain, operate and employ GPS to produce any desired effect across the full spectrum of conflict.  Specifically, this concept will bring together, under one umbrella, all of the disparate segments of the GPS operations, analysis and Navigation Warfare environments to form a single effects based center capable of optimally supporting Joint Vision 2020’s goal of full spectrum dominance and in full compliance with all national and international civil requirements.  The heart of the Center's effectiveness lies within its diverse personnel -- the GPSOC will be manned by representatives from across the DoD, DOT and allied military forces to create a unique operations center unlike any that currently exists at this echelon of command within the DoD.  
 
The overarching mission of the GPS Operations Center will be to operate, employ and maintain the Global Positioning System to produce a desired effect in support of military and/or civil operations across the full spectrum of conflict.  The key aspects of this effects-based GPSOC concept are:  
 
· Optimized constellation operations fully synchronized and supportive of SPACEAF and Combatant Commander's needs and operational priorities.  
· Robust, real-time performance monitoring and reporting ensuring a common operating picture and full situational awareness across all echelons of command.    
· Full integration, coordination and deconfliction of NAVWAR operations with routine military and civil operations for maximized impact and minimal collateral effects.  
· Direct and immediate access to an entire range of time critical GPS products and services designed to leverage the effectiveness of operations reliant on GPS services.  
· Rapid identification, isolation, and resolution of user reported outages or interference.  

The GPS Operations Center is key to delivering world class GPS user support.  It serves as the focal point for GPS interference reporting and resolution and as the joint center of GPS expertise for warfighting support.  The GPSOC has three main objectives: (1) detect, analyze, report, and resolve GPS anomalies, (2) monitor and report GPS performance, and (3) provide GPS status, constellation status, and tactical support.  The GPS Support Center (GSC) will provide high fidelity products, computer simulations, and information including detailed GPS performance assessments tailored specifically for the use of DoD and theater warfighting forces.  These products are intended as decision-making tools in the operational planning and execution process.  The GPSOC will provide monitoring of the performance of the GPS constellation and its constituent subsystems.  It will respond to DoD, United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Control Center (NOCC) problem reports and requests for information, and coordinate the collection, analysis, and distribution of information related to all GPS related anomalies through the 50 SW command structure.  

Areas of Qualifications/Capabilities:  

Respondents must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the GPS system and the 2 SOPS mission.  The support requires an in-depth knowledge of the GPS CONOPS, and the various types of data transmitted by each spacecraft to support various categories of users and missions. Core personnel must have an extensive background in the tools used by the GPS system to ensure the continuous availability and accuracy of the Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) information which is broadcast to all users of GPS.  This understanding is necessary for reporting GPS system performance predictions and analysis to a wide range of customers consisting of US armed forces, coalition and allied forces as required, Dept of Homeland Security through the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), Dept of Transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Command Center (NOCC), foreign equivalents, and other organizations or agencies as required.  The support requires an in-depth knowledge of Precise Positioning Service (PPS) monitoring and analysis to include positioning accuracy, range domain accuracy, service availability, and time transfer accuracy.  

Respondents must have the ability to translate raw performance data, and process the data, to support the creation of several vital types of products for use within the GPSOC and other Ops Centers, and for customers worldwide via the GPSOC GPS Information Service.  Specifically, the data is used to create real-time situational awareness products and performance assessment products to ensure that the system is performing optimally and that all military and civil requirements are being met.  

Significant portions of the sub-tasks contained within this mission area are of a non-routine nature and demand a high level of system knowledge and expertise.  Anomalies within the ground based orbit determination system, the remote monitor stations, or on-board the spacecraft's navigation payload must be immediately detected, isolated, and resolved to protect the accuracy and integrity of the service provided to users.  

In order to provide global and regional performance predictions a high degree of expertise in using the following tools: Dilution of Precision (DOP), Estimated Range Deviation (ERD), Navigation Solution (NAVSOL) is required.  Respondents are required to analyze, report and coordinate all user reported GPS anomalies and interferences for anomaly resolution.  They will also provide post-mission GPS performance assessments tailored to the users specifically identified geographic region(s) or coordinates.  Continuous 24/7 support is required from the GPSOC Contractor to ensure the capability to respond to significant anomalies or failures that may emerge requiring GPSOC resources to solve in a timely or urgent manner.  

Incumbent Contractor:

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a web-based database application capable of processing and storing hundreds of millions of sensor and log data records. This application, called Tracer, presents the data in a web browser in a unique and powerful way, allowing the analyst to see trends, patterns, details and hidden relationships.  

The heart of the system is a patent-pending approach to presenting interrelated views of the high-volumes of data. This analysis framework for holding interrelated views was developed to run within a standard web browser anywhere on the network. These views can be added or removed from the framework at will, and each view provides specific functionality that can stand alone.  For example, a view may include graphs, charts, maps, lists, or detailed record information. Each view may have drill-down capabilities and can be independently expanded as a separate web page. 

The power of Tracer is revealed when these views are combined within the framework and interact.  This interaction allows the analyst to evaluate a variety of displays simultaneously. When he or she finds something of interest, a click on the graph will cause all of the displays to re-query and display specific data related to the items of interest. 

The system was designed for INL’s cybersecurity group on the premise that the human security expert, armed with appropriate tools to view data, can be more effective in detecting and preventing attacks.  While Tracer is useable by security experts, it is flexible and could be applied in various industries depending on the underlying data sources of interest.

Key benefits to using Tracer include: 
Cost savings: The system is designed for easy installation and customization, reducing initial and on-going costs. 
Flexible and adaptable design: The system can incorporate new analysis methods and techniques quickly and without rework.
Increased staff effectiveness: Tracer allows staff to be more productive, lessening the need to hire additional and scarce expert analysts. 
Open and customizable: All data structures and code are available and customizable. Tracer can easily be adapted to specific needs and data sources. 
System and network protection: The most important benefit for security analysts is Tracer’s ability to assist in effectively detecting threats to critical data, systems and networks.

The INL is seeking to license Tracer to qualified distributors and/or directly to end users.  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing this software.  Interested parties should respond by July 31, 2005.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ANY CONTRACT AWARD. The purpose of this SOURCES SOUGHT Synopsis is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified Small Businesses, (including certified 8(a) firms, HUBZone Small Business; Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms; Small Disadvantage Business Firms) with North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541511 to perform "Development of Web-Based Documentation and Epidemiological Statistical Resources for the NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES)."  Please note that large businesses do not need to reply to this sources sought notice.
BACKGROUND:
The purpose of the proposed performance-based contract is to develop web-based documentation, merged datasets, and statistical analysis resources appropriate for large-scale epidemiological databases (including statistical weighting procedures required for multi-study sampling frames) for the NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES).  These datasets will be used for combined survey analyses performed by the CPES project team; for NIMH specific reports; and as a resource that other investigators may access and analyze.  Once created, the products will be made available to public data archiving agencies for ongoing use and maintenance.     
AGENCY: 
The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the Department of Health and Human Services, is the Federal agency charged with supporting and conducting research related to mental and behavioral disorders.  Recognizing the need for a current, comprehensive description of mental health and its correlates in the United States, the NIMH initiated a series of cross-sectional psychiatric epidemiology surveys to collect data from nationally representative samples of over 20,000 adults. These studies are intended to be a rich resource for data on population and geographic variations in mental health; co-occurring alcohol, drug and substance abuse; service use patterns; and barriers to treatment.  This initiative was accomplished using a U01 Cooperative Agreement mechanism to join 3 minority focused (African American, Latino and Asian American) projects -- the National Survey  of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Study -- with a broad psychiatric epidemiology survey (the National Comorbidity Survey- Replication) resulting in four (4) separate datasets.  These studies are known collectively as the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES).  The CPES is intended to provide prevalence estimates of mental disorders, and information on mental health and service use disparities within and among races and cultures and will elucidate the association between various risk and protective factors and the development of mental disorders.  Two design features of the CPES -- the use of complementary sampling procedures and the use of a core questionnaire -- were deliberately constructed to facilitate the ultimate creation of a combined dataset that would allow deeper levels of analysis on a greater number of research constructs.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory Office, requires a matrix assisted laser desorption ionizing double time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF/TOF) to determine with high precision and accuracy the mass/charge ratios of fragments of proteins in proteomics research.  A particular requirement is that the instrument be sensitive so that molecular masses can be determined on femtomole to sub-femtomole levels, levels that are typical for low-abundant proteins in cell and tissue samples.  The instrument is required to provide for the selection of the collision energy, the collision gas, a threshold gas pressure, and the mass windof for MS/MS analysis in order to selectively identify particular protein fragments.  The instrument is required to allow for the selection of the precursor ion of interest prior to fragmentation of that ion in the collision induced dissociation chamber to better control further fragmentation of the protein fragment.  The maximum collision energy should be variable form 500eV to 3000eV in the mass spectrometer to allow low energy unimolecular fragment and/or high energy single or multiple collision spectra to be produced for identification of the protein fragment. 

Based on NIST’s market research, NIST has identified only one system that is capable of all of the above: the 4700 PROTEOMICS DISCOVERY SYS W/MASCOT (Part No. 4345243) made by Applied Biosystems in Foster City, California.  Therefore, the NIST Acquisition Management Division intends to negotiate an open market purchase order on a sole source basis, under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, with Applied Biosystems for one (1) 4700 PROTEOMICS DISCOVERY SYS W/MASCOT (Part No. 4345243).  The item is a comprehensive system including state-of-the-art MALDI tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry, sophisticated bioinformatics, and enabling chemistries.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, parties that are expressly authorized by Applied Biosystems to sell the system noted above may respond to this notice to indicate that they are authorized to sell it and shall provide written evidence of such authorization.  Such notice shall be provided to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov no later than June 26, 2005.  The Government will then determine whether the procurement for the system noted above could be competed.  A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition will be based solely upon responses to this notice.

<DESC>This notice requests comments on products and services developed to meet the requirements of Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201), Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors; Special Publication 800-73, Interface for Personal Identity Verification; and Special Publication 800-78, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification.  This document is not a request for proposals or a statement of intent to initiate a procurement action, but it is a request for information regarding vendor’s capability to develop FIPS 201 compliant products.  

DATES:  Comments and information submitted by interested parties must be received by NIST by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on July 1, 2005.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  William C. Barker, NIST, (301) 975-8443 (FIPS201_products@nist.gov) or Ron Martin, Department of Commerce, (202) 482-4637 

ADDRESSES:  Responses may be submitted by email to:
(FIPS201_products@nist.gov) or by mail to the attention of William C. Barker of the NIST Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Mail Stop 8930, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8930.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Homeland Security Presidential Directive #12 (HSPD-12) of August 27, 2004, directed the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate a Federal Standard by February 27, 2005 that assures secure and reliable forms of identification of Federal and Federal contractor employees.  The standard, Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201), Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, was signed by the Secretary of Commerce on February 25, 2005.  HSPD-12 requires that, not later than eight months following promulgation of the Standard, “the heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable, require the use of identification by Federal employees and contractors that meets the Standard in gaining physical access to Federally controlled facilities and logical access to Federally controlled information systems.”  The principal requirements of HSPD-12 are to create a secure and reliable automated system that may be used Government-wide to: 1) establish the authentic true identity of an individual; 2) issue an identity credential token to each authenticated individual containing an “electronic representation” of the identity and the person to whom it is issued which can later be verified using appropriate technical when access to a secure Federal facility or information system is requested; 3) provide graduated  criteria that provide appropriate levels of assurance and security to the application; 4) be strongly resistant to identity fraud, counterfeiting, and exploitation by individuals, terrorist organizations, or conspiracy groups; 5) initiate development and use of interoperable automated systems meeting these requirements.  The technical focus of FIPS 201 and supplementing special publications (SP 800-73, SP 800-78, and SP 800-79) is on electronic identity and authorization credentials securely contained in an integrated-circuit token (“Smart Card”).   

FIPS 201 identifies product interoperability requirements (based on Special Publication 800-73, Special Publication 800-76, and Special Publication 800-78), cryptographic module requirements (conforming to FIPS 140-2), and system and component security requirements for Federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV).   FIPS 201 and the impending Special Publication 800-79 draft (June 17, 2005) also specify requirements and procedures required for accreditation of PIV credential issuers.  

In order to facilitate planning for testing, procurement, validation, and implementation of PIV systems conforming to all applicable functional and security requirements, information is being sought regarding products and services being offered to meet FIPS 201 requirements.

Specifically, NIST requests information regarding the hardware and software characteristics of FIPS 201-compliant products, timelines for product development, dates of availability of compliant in production quantities, and estimated cost of products and services.  NIST requests this information for both PIV components and integrated solutions.  Additionally, NIST requests information on a vendor’s capability to setup test harness for PIV systems and conduct compliance tests.  Funding to support a future procurement has not been secured at this time.  Responses are due by July 1, 2005.  

PLEASE NOTE:  All information submitted in response to this request will be publicly released.  Therefore, do not include proprietary or confidential business information in your response.  Vendors responding to this notice assume the risk of public disclosure if confidential information is included.

<DESC>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is seeking comprehensive business solutions for meeting the statement of objectives described herein for the Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program. This is a sources sought to identify qualified small business concerns capable of achieving the REP objectives. A contractor is required to provide exercise, programmatic, technical, and administrative support to allow FEMA to meet its Congressional mandate to implement the REP program.  This mandate is to provide the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public living around commercial nuclear power plants is being maintained.  The REP objectives include: i) proving all necessary support including extensive exercise support necessary for successful completion of exercise activities in accordance with the Standard Exercise Report Format (SERF), 44 CFR 350-344, site specific plans, and other REP related regulations, policies, and procedures; ii) providing all necessary administrative support for REP exercise & drills in an efficient and cost effective manner; iii) providing expert guidance for the review of REP offsite plans pursuant to FEMA rule 44 CFR Part 350; iv) providing REP policy guidance on offsite REP preparedness in accordance with NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, providing REP quantitative program assessments of resource efficacy, participating in strategic planning, providing performance measures, providing performance based budgeting, providing resource management, conducting resource request analysis, integrating budget and performance data, providing REP document and content management, and assisting with Congressional reporting; v) developing course material and providing instructors for all REP program courses; vi) providing expert technical guidance for REP health physics support of the planning elements in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 on radiation protection, dose assessment, environmental and population monitoring, laboratory analyses, offsite emergency radiation measurement systems for the following three pathways: the airborne release; the milk pathway; and the water and nondairy foods pathway, and other health physics related areas; and vii) providing REP cost accounting in accordance with 44 CFR Part 354 to track REP costs for assessment of user fees on NRC licenses of commercial nuclear power plants. The required exercise support under objective 1 as well as all other required services for this effort is extensive. FEMA is responsible for the evaluation of 30 to 35 exercises of site-specific offsite radiological emergency preparedness plans annually and an additional 10 to 20 remedial drills. About 60 to 100 additional medical, rehearsal and other out-of sequence drills are also evaluated per year.  The contractor shall maintain a sufficient pool of qualified evaluators with appropriate ranges of technical expertise to ensure that staffing requirements for exercises and drills can be met at any given time. Full scale REP exercises may require up to 50 or more contractor evaluators per exercise. Smaller-scale REP drills (medical, out of sequence, rehearsal, etc) usually require between 1-10 contractor evaluators.  Concurrent full scale exercises (in separate FEMA Regions) are anticipated.  The period of performance is 12 months from the date of award with four one-year option periods.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. Due diligence will be conducted with vendors that are deemed to have a reasonable chance of contract award.  The anticipated contract type is cost plus fixed fee (CPFF). This is a sources sought for qualified small business concerns that can demonstrate the capacity and ability to meet the REP objectives.  Interested small business concerns must submit three copies of a capability statement demonstrating that they have the capacity and ability to meet the REP objectives described herein.  All responses to this synopsis must be received by June 30, 2005. If it is determined that no small business concerns are capable of meeting the REP objectives, the Government will proceed with synopsizing and issuing a request for proposal on an unrestricted full and open competition basis.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries. Since 1950, NARA has provided high-quality, cost-effective storage and servicing of temporary records to Federal and public customers. NARA has safeguarded the nation's records including citizen tax returns, Official Military Personnel Folders, passport applications and Top Secret military records for their scheduled life. Under the direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) instituted a fee-for-service revolving fund on October 1, 1999, for its records centers’ storage and servicing operation.  NARA organized a Records Center Program (RCP) to carry out this function.  
Key statistics about the Federal Records Center Program:
•	17 facilities in 9 regions throughout the United States 
•	Total holdings of over 24 million cubic feet of records 
•	13 million reference requests serviced annually 
•	18,000 tons of paper recycled annually 
•	Professional staff of approximately 1,100 Federal employees 
•	Nearly 400 Federal agency customers 
For additional information visit the NARA website:  http://www.archives.gov/records_center_program/about_rcp.html

Request for Information (RFI) for the NARA Record Center Program (RCP) Operations System (RCPOS).  NARA is considering the introduction of technology into the RCP to achieve customer improvements and operational savings.  Currently, there is comparatively little coordinated activity among different centers in terms of the processes and information dissemination mechanisms used to serve customers. Across the board, the current NARA system is mostly manual, paper-intensive, fragmented and often redundant. The situation is complicated further through each center’s individual processes, data, and requirements, and, sometimes, regulations.  Where automated, the systems are not integrated, are inflexible to change, and are technologically obsolete.  The NARA RCP program currently uses existing information technology (IT) systems that are typically legacy mainframe applications.  It is imperative to note that the Government seeks a system solution composed of Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) products.  The Government seeks to avoid the creation of yet another legacy system, so a primary feature of this system is that it has the ability to remain as contemporary as practicable.

This RFI is intended strictly for market research purposes and may not lead to a solicitation or contract. The preliminary contracting approach outlined below is for a full-and-open competition for a system that will meet the requirements of the NARA RCP program.  Full and open competition is the preferred approach in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The contract will be structured as a service contract.  The NARA RCP does not want to pay for the implementation of an IT system, but desires to enter into a contract for the delivery of IT services that meet the functional needs of the NARA RCP for five years (base year plus four option years), using a best value competition. The Government intends to retain complete ownership and unlimited rights to the data collected and processed under this contract.  The NARA RCP does not want any ownership of hardware, software or configuration.  Contractor retained rights will be the subject of further discussion. 

The Contractor, therefore, must accept the risk of compiling a set of COTS products into a system that handles the functional requirements of the RCP.  Under this scheme, the Government would not exercise the first option of the contract until the Contractor has provided a bona fide COTS system solution.  The Contractor would be working at risk, although a termination charge offers some protection, until this point.  The Contractor will be able to recover initial costs as part of the monthly payments made by the Government for the IT services provided once the Contractor has provided its solution.

The NARA RCP is now updating Concept of Operations, Functional and Technical Requirements, testing and Sequencing Plan documents that will be used as the basis for the service contract.  A Concept of Operations draft is available by email from the point of contact shown below. Final documents will be available by Sept. 30, 2005.  Generally, the RCPOS will need to address and meet the following business needs: 

1.	Inventory and space management.  
•	Track records location, movement and status.
•	Provide enhanced search and retrieval functionality across all data.
•	Holdings information: hierarchical and box level control, disposition schedules, and billing data.
•	Collections management information for permanent and electronic records.

2.	Automated support for the records operations.  
•	Streamline the transfer and reference processes using the web and bar-coding technology, and facilitate automated workflow of transactions for processing.  
•	Improve quality control to eliminate erroneous disposals of records and lost records.

3.	Automated support for activity measurement.

•	Maintain information about the completion of tasks within records center operations.
•	Allow workload measurement system wide, at each records center, and by individual product/service offered by the RCP.
•	Collect data to support product pricing.

4.	Cross-system integration.  
•	Conform to the NARA target architecture.  
•	Allow data to flow to and from NARA financial, property, and acquisition systems, including ERA, RCPBS and CMRS.  
•	Integrate with other Federal agency systems in order to transmit and receive necessary data.  

5.	Real time transactional data.
•	View information about available space, holdings, reference requests, and billing information that is accurate and up-to-date. 
•	Provide to customers the information they need concerning their holdings and services.  
•	Provide to Records center staff immediate access to the information they need, facilitating better customer service.  

The Government's preliminary view is that the RCP functional requirements can be fully met with integrated COTS software.  

The NARA RCPOS will be implemented incrementally with a minimum of two new increments per year. The first increment will incorporate sufficient core functionality to achieve an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) that can turn off the existing legacy applications.  Requirements will be allocated to successive increments as needed to achieve Full Operational Capability. The NARA RCP will purchase functional services in accordance with the negotiated contract schedule and as the services pass Government testing for functionality and performance.  Firm contract requirements will be available prior to the issuance of the solicitation. As previously stated, the Contractor must provide the system at no initial cost to NARA. The Contractor would recoup the initial cost of the system as part of the monthly service charge over the five year period of the contract. The Government also, during the course of the contract, expects to introduce some enhancement requirements not included in the final requirements document as new business opportunities arise, as new technologies are introduced into the marketplace and as lessons learned with the IOC demonstrate opportunities to further enhance the NARA RCP with an acceptable return on investment (ROI).  

The current acquisition strategy requires that all offerors compete for total program requirements to ensure best value using full life cycle costing. As discussed below, offerors are encouraged to provide comments on the NARA RCP acquisition approach. NARA is soliciting information to identify potential Contractors capable of acting in the role of system developer and service provider for the NARA RCPOS.  

This RFI is the first step that NARA plans to take to solicit input and interest from the vendor community and to promote competition in response to the forthcoming solicitation.

DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK FOR FIRE PROTECTION INSPECTION SERVICES 

Article 1   Background

1.1	The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has responsibility for conducting, supporting, and promoting biomedical research.  NIH seeks to improve the health of American people through increasing the understanding of processes underlying human health, disability, and disease.  The NIH supports biomedical and behavioral research domestically and abroad.  Furthermore, NIH conducts research in-house in laboratories, primarily in the Bethesda-Rockville, Maryland, and works to distribute medical knowledge to the public.

1.2	The main NIH campus is located in Bethesda, Maryland, an urban area approximately ten miles north of Washington, D.C.  While the normal duty station of all personnel covered under this contract will be with the NIH Division of the Fire Marshal (DFM)/Office of Research Services (ORS) at the Bethesda, MD Campus, several off-site facilities also exist, which may or may not be covered under this contract.  These other facilities include: the NIH Animal Center, Poolesville, MD; the Gerentology Research Center, Baltimore, MD; the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, Hamilton Montana; and Frederick Cancer Research Center at Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD.

1.3	The NIH Fire Marshal (Director, DFM/ORS) is the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), as defined by the National Fire Protection Association for matters involving fire protection and life safety for all NIH-owned facilities.

1.4	The occupancies classifications of the buildings under the jurisdiction of the DFM include: Laboratory/Industrial; Office/Business; Health Care; Ambulatory Health Care; Public Assembly; Animal Holding/Storage; Residential/Single Family, Hotel and Dormitory and Power Plants (including utility distribution tunnels).

1.5	In accordance with Public Law 100-678 the NIH is mandated to follow a nationally recognized building code, as well as other nationally recognized fire safety codes and standards.  In addition, the NIH has established certain fire safety policies that may exceed, or amend, the provisions of the model codes.  Generally the versions of the codes in-use are the most recent editions.  At present the building code of record is the 2000 Edition of the International Building Code, the fire safety code is the 2002 Edition of the NFPA 1, Uniform Fire Code.  In addition, the 2003 Edition of the NFPA 101, Life Safety Code is used as it is part of the National Fire Codes.  In cases of conflicting code requirements, the most stringent provisions apply unless the issue is specifically addressed per NIH policy or a Variance Request has been approved by the NIH Fire Marshal.  The use of any fire or building code by the NIH may be subject to change in accordance with NIH policy.

1.6	Staffing levels for the Division of the Fire Marshal will be determined by the NIH Fire Marshal using a performance management approach.  It is intended that the number of personnel provided under this contract mechanism be flexible to accommodate changes to the NIH Fire Marshal’s jurisdiction.

Article 2   Specific Requirements

2.1	The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision and management necessary to provide all fire protection inspector services described herein.  All work functions are categorized into the following groups:
a. Building Inspections: 	
The DFM is required to provide one fire protection inspection of every building under its jurisdiction on an annual basis. Upon the establishment of this contract all buildings under the DFM’s jurisdiction will be assigned to either civil servant or contractor personnel.  The number of buildings assigned to the Contractor is subject to change based on civil servant staffing levels and the growth or contraction of the facilities within the DFM’s jurisdiction.
(1) The Project Officer will advise the Program Manager of the buildings assigned at the kickoff meeting.
(2) For all buildings under its purview, the contractor shall provide the Project Officer with copies of all inspection reports, violation notices and supporting documentation, which will be forwarded to the appropriate NIH authorities for correction or action. 
(3) Any fire safety violations observed by the Contractor and deemed to be an imminent hazard shall be identified and brought to the attention of the building occupants.  Reasonable actions to mitigate the hazard shall be taken at the time of the discovery, if appropriate.  The Contractor shall immediately notify the NIH Fire Marshal and provide complete documentation of the occurrence to the Project Officer.  The NIH Fire Marshal shall be the final authority in the determination of the suitability of buildings (or areas) to be safely occupied.
b. JCAHO Nurses Training:	
The DFM provides required quarterly fire drills/fire safety training for the nursing staff and hospital departments at the NIH Clinical Center (CC) in accordance with the requirements of the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO).  Upon the establishment of this contract the CC fire drills and fire safety training sessions will be assigned to either civil servant or contractor personnel.  The portion of the workload assigned to the contractor is subject to change based on the number of nursing units and departments at the CC as well as the civil servant staffing levels.
(1) The DFM is required to perform unannounced fire drills for each 24 hour nursing unit and each shift (3 shifts per day) on a quarterly basis. This will require night and evening work to ensure that all shifts are trained. The ambulatory care units and day hospitals are trained quarterly as well, but only operate on a day shift. On the average these drills are ½ hour in length.
(2) The Clinical Center departments (eg. Pharmacy, Phlebotomy, Housekeeping, etc.) are provided with fire safety training that is arranged with the department in advance.  These sessions are generally in a classroom setting and should average approximately 1 hour in length.
c. Fire Safety Awareness:	
The DFM provides fire safety awareness information to the entire NIH community.  This outreach is in the form of fire safety awareness training sessions, fire safety displays and news articles promoting fire safety subjects.  Upon the establishment of this contract the fire safety awareness training sessions will be set-up on a building by building basis.  Civil servant and contractor personnel will perform fire safety awareness training in the buildings to which they are assigned for the purposes of building inspections.  Requests for training usually come from various safety committees and contact persons within the buildings.
(1) Fire safety awareness training sessions are provided to groups within the NIH community (usually within a specific building).  Topics may include, but are not limited to fire safety in the workplace, home fire safety, laboratory fire safety and dormitory fire safety.  The fire protection inspector is given the latitude to tailor the training session to meet the needs of the group and these classes, which are generally performed in a classroom setting, are usually 1 hour in length. 
(2) Fire protection displays are set up 3 or 4 times per year (on average) in conjunction with NIH Fire Safety Awareness Day, other public safety events and NIH Career Day.  Information and pamphlets are distributed and the DFM staff are available to answer questions from the community.  Displays are generally setup for 4 to 6 hours.
(3) Fire safety news articles are generally written for publication in NIH media such as the NIH Record and the ORS News2Use.  Topics for publication are usually relevant to the season, related to significant fire incidents, discuss noteworthy changes to fire protection policies and identify major upgrades/changes to fire protection systems.  The Contractor shall write fire safety news articles at the discretion of the NIH Fire Marshal, generally 4 to 6 topics per year.
d. Hazardous  Work Permits:	
The DFM is charged with issuing hazardous work permits Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM of each work week (excluding government holidays and periods when government offices are closed due to inclement weather). Civil servants and contractor personnel will split this duty on a day-by-day basis with one person assigned to respond to requests for hazardous work permits each work day. Hazardous work permits are required prior to the commencement of any work (by contractor or government employees) or operation that will involve the use of an open flame, or will evolve sparks, embers or smoke either in a building or outdoors. While the goal of this process is to identify the means to prevent localized hot work from igniting a fire, consideration shall also be given to minimizing the potential for unwanted fire alarms and unnecessary fire department responses.
(1) Contractors shall receive and respond to requests for hazardous work permits within 30 minutes.
(2) Contractors shall inspect the area in which the hazardous work will be performed and evaluate the nature of the hazard as it relates to the surroundings.
(3) Contractors shall advise the requestor of any measures that will reduce the risk associated with the hazardous work in writing.  Standard forms will be provided.  One copy remains posted at the job site, one copy is provided to the NIH Fire Marshal and one copy remains with the contractor for record keeping.
e. Public Assembly Events:	
From time to time the DFM is required to monitor public assembly events to ensure that the spaces are being utilized safely and in accordance with the posted occupant load limits. Civil servant and Contractor  personnel will be assigned this duty on an as-needed basis.  The lead time for such assignments is generally on the order of days or weeks, however, there are occasions in which the DFM is expected to respond immediately to evaluate conditions in which overcrowding is suspected of being a hazard to the public.
(1) The Contractor shall evaluate the hazard of the public assembly event based on the actual number of attendees versus the posted occupant load limit, impediments to the means of egress, and impediments, if any, to the fire suppression and fire alarm systems. The identification of any issues that would compromise the safety of any persons shall be immediately forwarded to the NIH Fire Marshal. If the NIH Fire Marshal is not immediately available a reasonable means to alleviate the hazard shall be made in conjunction with the NIH Police and/or Fire Departments as necessary.
(2) If the Contractor is called to respond to an area subject to public assembly that is not provided with an occupant load limit sign the Contractor shall use the principles in the NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, to determine a safe occupant load for the area. The NIH Fire Marshal shall be notified of this determination and all supporting documentation shall be maintained. The Contractor shall then coordinate the NIH Fire Marshal’s requirements with the safe functional use of the space.
(3) Any issues that involve the removal of persons from an event for public safety reasons are the responsibility of law enforcement officers.  The Contractor shall immediately coordinate these activities with the NIH Police Department and notify the NIH Fire Marshal. 
(4) Public assembly events that involve the participation of government or private sector VIPs may require additional background checks or security screening for personnel representing the DFM.  The Contractor is expected to cooperate fully with all security requirements prior to or during an event.
f. Fire Investigations:
The DFM is charged with determining the cause and origin of all fire incidents at the NIH.  Per NIH policy a Technical Fire Investigation is required to be conducted for any fire incident involving $10,000 in property loss, injuries to personnel or loss of life.  Investigation reports for fires falling under the threshold for a technical fire investigation may be required at the discretion of the NIH Fire Marshal. Civil servant and Contractor personnel may be assigned as the lead fire investigator for any incident at the discretion of the NIH Fire Marshal.
(1) The Contractor shall be available to conduct fire investigations during normal working hours as well as off-hours (evenings, nights, weekends, government holidays and times when the government is closed due to inclement weather) and shall respond to all such requests within 2 hours.
(2) The methodology for cause and origin determination shall be in accordance with a nationally recognized standard (eg. NFPA 921, Standard for Fire Investigations) and applicable NIH policies.
(3) If the investigation reveals a potential crime scene the NIH Police Department shall be notified immediately, with subsequent notification to the NIH Fire Marshal. The Contractor shall preserve the potential crime scene until the arrival of the responsible law enforcement authorities. 
(4) If the scene is already under or becomes under the control of other government investigators (FBI, ATF, etc.) the Contractor shall cease his investigation until receiving clear direction on how to proceed from the NIH Fire Marshal.
(5) All technical fire investigation reports shall follow the NIH Technical Fire Investigation format, which will be provided. 
(6) The Contractor shall provide information on any fire investigation, that is not considered a Technical Fire Investigation, in a concise format suitable to the NIH Fire Marshal. 
(7) The Contractor shall be available, under the provisions of this contract, to participate in any litigation that may arise from any fire investigation that he conducts on behalf of the DFM.
g. Tent/Trailer Inspections:	
The DFM is responsible for inspecting and approving temporary facilities such as tents and trailers prior to occupancy by the government, contractors or the public. The lead time for any such inspection is generally 1 or 2 days, however there may be occasions where an immediate response is necessary.  NIH has specific policy requirements for tents and trailers that will be provided.
(1) The Contractor shall respond to inspection requests for temporary facilities at the discretion of the NIH Fire Marshal.
(2) The Contractor shall recommend that the NIH Fire Marshal approve or deny occupancy for the temporary facility.  If denial of occupancy is recommended, a punchlist citing the deviations from NIH policy shall be provided in writing.
h.  Consultations:	
The DFM provides consultation services, for matters related to fire protection, to the NIH community.  Responses to questions from the community may need to be coordinated with the NIH authorities for Occupational Safety & Health, Security, Emergency Management, Emergency Response, Maintenance and Facility Management.  
(1) The Contractor shall respond to questions from the NIH community orally or in writing.  Documentation of the response to the question shall be in writing (Consultation Form) and shall include appropriate references to fire code and/or NIH fire safety policies. 

Article 3   Contractor Effort Required
The contractor shall provide staffing at the levels determined by the NIH Fire Marshal and will be notified at least 30 days in advance of changes.  All contract positions shall be full time (40 hours per week).

Article 4   Response Specifications

4.1	The Contractor shall respond to all problems presented by the Project Officer upon notification.  This response shall conform, at a minimum, to the following schedule:
a.	Emergency Response:   Emergency responses consist of: 1) assisting the NIH Fire Department with securing a fire scene and commencing any fire investigation efforts and 2) Responding to complaints involving potentially hazardous situations.  The Contractor shall remain on the scene until a confirmation that a hazardous situation no longer exists or is released by the NIH Fire Marshal or his representative. 
From 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. during regular work days, the Contractor shall respond within 15 minutes upon notification.  During all other times (3:00 p.m to 7:00 a.m. on weekdays, weekends and government holidays), the Contractor shall respond within two (2) hours of the first attempt of notification.
b.	Routine Response:   Routine responses consist of addressing fire safety related issues that will not significantly interrupt or otherwise adversely affect the NIH operations or the safety of persons.  Examples of routine responses include requests for hazardous work permits and any other condition requiring evaluation as determined by the Project Officer.  From 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., the Contractor shall respond within 30 minutes to routine service calls and address each item within one hour.

<SUBJECT>SMCM UUV Industry Day Announcement
<DESC>All interested contractors are invited to attend an Industry Day with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel involved in advancing the capabilities of unmanned underwater vehicles in Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) applications.  This event will be held on 20 July 2005 at the Navy Memorial in Washington, DC (701 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20004).  The yellow and green Metro lines serve the Navy Memorial.  The objective of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for the future procurement of un-tethered, unmanned, underwater Mine Countermeasures (MCM) systems that will support the Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) mission in the Shallow Water (SW) and deeper water zones (40 – 600 feet sea water (FSW)).  Unmanned vehicles have the potential of addressing the two key, overarching MCM measures of effectiveness (MOE), which are to: 1) Reduce the overall MCM tactical timeline; and 2) Redu! ce the overall risk to MCM forces.  UUVs have the potential to systematically reconnoiter predetermined geographic areas (nominally 5NM X 5NM) and precisely map the bottom contour while providing information to assist in the detection and classification of bottom, volume, and potentially buried objects that exhibit mine-like characteristics.  Additionally, unmanned vehicles equipped with high-resolution sensors can be used to reacquire and identify previously mapped targets of interest.  The SMCM UUVs must be safely deployed and recovered from surface crafts of opportunity (i.e. LCS, MCM-1 class, and other possibly Naval platforms), preferably with existing shipboard equipment.  The vehicles will need to possess mobile ingress/egress capabilities to enable them to move from a launch point of up to nominal ranges at 5 NM or greater.  Data recorded by the vehicle must be transferable to compatible Navy tactical displays and information systems (i.e. GCCS/MEDAL (Mine Warfare En! vironmental Data and Aides Library)) to facilitate the re-acquisition of targets during subsequent missions by other USN Mine Warfare assets. The U.S. Navy has been exploring SMCM UUV employment concepts through several Office of Naval Research and PEO-LMW sponsored demonstrations. These demonstrations have been crucial to gaining fleet feedback and assisting in developing system requirements for the initiation of an acquisition program in FY06.  It is envisioned that one or multiple follow-on acquisitions initiatives could be supported, ranging from Abbreviated Acquisition to ACAT III programs.  Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate the development of a future competitive acquisition strategy.  The Acquisition Strategy for fielding a first generation SMCM deployed UUV system will also be briefed.  Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Attendance at the Indust! ry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals.  However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation.  Any read ahead documentation will be posted for viewing on or about 06 July 2005.  Seating is limited.  Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor.  Request attendees’ register for the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, address, telephone number, and e-mail address not later than 15 July 2005.  Registration data must be Faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC identified below.  Approximately two weeks prior to the SMCM UUV Industry Day, read ahead documents will be available electronically from the Technical POC for any interested contractor.  Registered attendees will be sent this read ahead information by e-mail when a! vailable.  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop or the read-ahead documentation may be Faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC so that they can be addressed at Industry Day.  The purpose of this Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved.  For questions please contact the Technical POC: Patrick Whang (301) 744-6850 ext 286, FAX (301) 744-6947, e-mail: whangpy@eodpoe2.navsea.navy.mil.

We request additional time to perform the following:

•	Evaluate materials featuring Power Panther to ensure that the information is consistent with the new image of the spokescharacter.
•	Work with a subcontractor to develop and design a prototype costume.

FNS intends to award a follow-on modification to purchase order 43-3198-4-0134, to YMS Consulting for continued development of the Power Panther Spokescharacter on a sole source basis, citing the authority of FAR 6.302-1(B).  No solicitation is available.   Qualified sources may submit a proposal demonstrating capability and pricing points.  Proposals must be received within three business days of this notice.  Based on responses to this notice, a determination not to compete this proposed award is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The contract will enable USAID to receive 3,000,000 - 4,000,000 vials of Megestron from the manufacturer for USAID-supported family planning programs. The availability of an injectable contraceptive is an essential element to the continued success of USAID-supported family planning program. USAID has selected Megestron because it meets basic requirements for supply.  Megestron is a three-month injectable contraceptive of DMPA (Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate) comparable to Depo-Provera, which is distributed to USAID- support family planning programs worldwide.  This product has been approved by a stringent regulatory authority; it is approved for use in Europe and many other countries by the Medical Evaluation Board in Amsterdam, which in Holland is the equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Megeston is available for immediate delivery in USAID’s public sector presentation which bundles the DMPA with auto-disable syringes and sharps disposal containers.  This product has been registered in approximately 35 countries in which USAID currently supplies DMPA and is available at a low public sector price.  Megestron will provide the Agency with an alternative injectable source to provide supplies to family planning programs that USAID currently supports.   

The authorized source and origin code for this procurement is 935 (any country or area excluding foreign policy-restricted countries).

USAID intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all statements of interest received within thirty days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The letter of notification and the inspection/teardown report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for disposition.  If overhaul is subsequently authorized, the contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in 5.2.

5.1.1.4.	Unusual Damage:  When components are received and the contractor's inspection
indicates obvious misuse, unusual or severe damage, the contractor shall discontinue all actions until a DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR is notified and personally witnesses the continuance of inspection and tear down.  The DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR will be responsible to sign and date the Contractor's Unusual Damage Claim Request.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-Q-625749 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is a total small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance experience will be evaluated.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  The Coast Guard has a requirement to procure the following items for the TEMPORARY BERTHING & MESSING of the USCGC STEADFAST (WMEC 623) crew during the period of 11 August 2005 through 01 September 2005.  The cutter will be drydocked at Cascade General, 5555 Channel Avenue, Portland Oregon.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is SB1341-05-Q-0569.  The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The acquisition will be made pursuant to FAR 13.5.
 
The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-03.  This solicitation is being conducted on an unrestricted competitive basis.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 339111, and the small business size standard for that NAICS code is 500 or fewer employees.  The list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure are as follows: Item No. 0001, 10 Tesla Cryogen-free split pair, room temperature bore superconducting magnet; Quantity: 1; Unit: Each. 

The magnet will be used in our user facility therefore its operation must be reliable, simple, and as flexible as reasonably possible. For these reasons, the magnet must be a room temperature bore, cryogen-free symmetric split-coil superconducting magnet system that has a maximum field capability of 10 Tesla. It must also include a superconducting magnet power supply.
Specific Tasks
Design, build, deliver and install a magnet system, to include training, with the following specifications:
Facility Requirements
Power available: 30 Amp 208V 3-phase, 30 Amp 220 V 1-phase, 20 Amp 220 V 1-phase

System size and transport: The system must be able to be transported through doorways that are 83 inches tall and 33 inches wide. Three lifting lugs must be supplied on the magnet top plate for hoist transport. It must be possible to hoist the magnet with approximately 4 foot long lifting cables without interference with any of the magnet components, including the compressor coldhead and hoses and the top plate user interface specified below.

Chilled water: Because the system is portable it should run without chilled water and the compressor should be air-cooled.

Cable and hose connection lengths: Minimum length for connecting hoses and cables between the magnet and associated power supply and compressor is 12 feet.
Design Constraints:  PLEASE REQUEST VIA EMAIL TO drincon@nist.gov BY JUNE 21, 2005.  

Forces on the magnet:  The magnet must be able to run at rated maximum field with 35 lbs. of lateral force and 600 lbs. of axial force due to magnetic materials in the external environment.

Base plate adapter flange:  The adapter flange must connect the magnet cryostat to both a Huber 5204.2 (230 mm bolt square or 325.3 mm diameter) and a Huber 5203.2 (154 mm bolt square or 217.8 mm diameter) by providing clearance holes for ¼ inch bolts (this will also allow M6 bolts). The bolt connection to the magnet cryostat itself can be from below with blind tapped holes in the base of the magnet cryostat.  In order to make the adapter flange thinner the bolt heads used to attach the adapter flange to the Huber goniometer can be recessed in counter bored holes in the base of the magnet cryostat.  Since it must be possible to evacuate the warm bore there must be a removable vacuum seal at the bottom of the warm bore. This could be accomplished by cutting an O-ring groove into the cryostat base and adding a blind tapped bolt circle so that a cap can be bolted over the warm bore opening. A central hole would have to be cut in the adapter flange to accommodate this cap. Another possibility is to provide a sliding O-ring seal along the warm bore.

Top plate user interface (see diagram – PLEASE REQUEST VIA EMAIL TO drincon@nist.gov BY JUNE 21, 2005):  The upper warm bore flange is to be a flush mount aluminum ring of approximate diameter P=225 mm, with an O-ring  groove for a 1/8 inch O-ring for sealing in the case of evacuation of the warm bore. The approximate inside diameter of this O-ring groove is to be 193 mm. Outside the O-ring diameter there is to be a bolt circle on an approximately 210 mm diameter which serves to attach the warm bore flange to the top plate. There are to be two blind tapped bolt circles on the top plate for mounting sample environment equipment. One of these bolt circles is for 12xM6 bolts with a diameter of 400 mm and offset from the warm bore axis by 73.2 mm.  The second bolt circle is for 8xM6 bolts on a diameter of 282.8 mm centered on the warm bore axis so that two of the bolt holes near the cold head can be shared between the two bolt circles. The top plate must be able to support at least 80 kg of sample environment equipment.  On the top plate interface drawing below we have marked a position for the magnet cold head unit using the approximate dimensions of a SHI (Sumitomo Heavy Industries) SRDK-415 cold head. This cold head is used for illustrative purposes only. We do not imply that this cold head is required or best-suited for this purpose. In this drawing the circle has the diameter of the vacuum flange of this cold head and the two rectangles mark the position of the helium gas line bulkhead and the helium gas lines themselves. By mounting the cold head in the rotated position as shown and providing elbow fittings to redirect the helium lines to vertical it should be possible to keep everything inside the top flange diameter.

System weight: Minimize system weight where possible.

Azimuthal beam path access (w): 300 degrees minimum. That is, cabling and other non-symmetric components between the magnet coils shall be concentrated in an azimuthal section no larger than 60 degrees, and the position of this dark angle shall be marked on the exterior of the magnet cryostat.

Tilt angle: The system must operate at tilt angles from vertical of at least +-8 degrees.

Beam path: The beam path in and out of the cryostat must only impinge on aluminum alloys including the outside vacuum wall and the warm bore wall. It must have the minimum total thickness of aluminum alloy required to support the magnet split at the given azimuthal beam access, and providing sufficient heat shielding.  The total aluminum alloy thickness in the beam path diameter (MABP = minimal aluminum beam path) is limited to 37 mm or below. Alloy content is to be specified in the proposal so that it can be reviewed for compatibility with neutron transmission. In addition, the outward facing area of the magnet casing within 1 cm of the split should be protected from our incident neutron beams by covering primary exposed material with thin cadmium sheet (at least 0.2 mm thick) or Li-6 impregnated flexible plastic that we provide (1/8 inch thick). If possible the  areas of the magnet casing facing the split (facing up and down) should also be covered with cadmium. We realize that this secondary area is filled with the support rings between the split coils, but would like to know if there is a possibility of adding this neutron shielding. Any neutron shielding must be rigidly fixed in place so that it can not possibly move.

Cool down time: from room temperature to operation: 60 hours maximum cryogen free.
after a magnet quench: 12 hours maximum cryogen free.

Power supply: The system must include a bipolar power supply which can ramp the magnet to 80% of maximum field in under 20 minutes and ramp the magnet to 100% of maximum field in under 35 minutes. The output stability after warm up for standard conditions (8 hours operation, or 1 degree C ambient temperature change, or source power voltage changes within rated line voltage) must be at least as good as 0.01% of full scale for both amperage and voltage. The digital programming resolution for current must be at least as good as 0.01 Amperes, and digital programming accuracy must be at least as good as 0.1% of full scale. The power supply must have computer communications via RS-232. Cables to the magnet shall be at least 12 feet long.

System connections: All system connections and cabling to the magnet, including helium compressor hoses must proceed in a vertical direction from the top plate.

Delivery
Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means that the vendor shall be responsible for any loss and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt, inspection, and acceptance at the delivery point.   
 
The delivery point is NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.   The Vendor shall identify any Government required property or assistance required during Contractor installation.

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  A firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded to the vendor whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be most advantageous to the Government.  The Government will determine best value on the basis of the following evaluation factors:  (1) Technical Capability factor “Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement,” (2) Past Experience, (3)  Past Performance, and (4) Price.
 
(1)  Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the evidence in the quotation of the contractor's understanding of the requirement and the specifications of the offered product.  Quotations shall include a description of the instrument, user's manual, terms of warranty,  installation, and on-site training.  Contractors must include sufficient documentation or product literature to CLEARLY DOCUMENT that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications.  
 
(2)  Past Experience will be evaluated to determine the vendor’s experience in providing comparable instruments and performing similar system integration.  The Contractor shall describe, as a minimum, two similar requirements that were successfully completed during the last four years.
 
(3)  Past Performance:  Past Performance will be evaluated only for instruments offered that meet the Government’s required technical capability and specifications.  Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and services provided by the Contractor, including successful integration.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on information obtained from the references provided in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST or its affiliates.  Vendors shall provide a list of three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold within the last three years.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum:  The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization, telephone number and email address of the reference contact person, the contract number (if applicable), amount of the contract, and the address and telephone number or Email address of the Contracting Officer.
 
(4)   Price:  Price offered shall be firm-fixed price.  Price shall include a description of the instrument, technical information, installation, and on-site training.  Provide sufficient information to determine price reasonableness, e.g., list price and any applied discounts.  Note, if the beam height to mounting surface distance can be made to be 152 mm it will save NIST the cost of separately purchasing a Huber 5203.2 or equivalent goniometer (approximately $25,000) as well as the inconvenience of swapping goniometers for each experiment. The required goniometer is not part of this solicitation, but if a 170 mm beam height to mounting surface distance is part of the offeror’s proposal then the government cost of procuring one will be added to the offeror’s price proposal for evaluation purposes.
 
Past Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall be evaluated only for quotations determined to be technically acceptable in accordance with the technical capability factor.
 
The combined factors of Technical Capability, Past Experience, and Past Performance are more important than price.  Although the Technical Capability, Past Experience, and Past Performance factors will be of greater weight for evaluation purposes, offerors are cautioned not to minimize the importance of the price proposal since award will be made to the offeror whose overall price is most advantageous to the Government after evaluation of all factors.  
  
FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration applies to this RFQ.  To be eligible for award, vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry. Information on the CCR may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS number is required to register.   To procure a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or 610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number. 
 
It is mandatory that all vendors complete the on-line provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items located at the website,  http://orca.bpn.gov/.  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is an e-Government initiative that has been developed to replace most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) process.  It is requirement for all solicitations that require CCR registration.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3),
2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606,

               Performance Work Statement
1.0.  INTRODUCTION.  This requirement defines tasks for obtaining parts and services needed for the overhaul of the Pump Module Assemblies and associated component parts that are utilized on the Coast Guard fleet of HH-60J aircraft.  Funding for this contract will be provided from annual operating guide 41.00, Funds for Aircraft Maintenance.

2.0.  SCOPE OF WORK.  On an “as required basis”, the contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul systems and subsystems of the HH-60J helicopter Pump Module Assemblies, as necessary to conform with the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS), at the firm fixed prices specified in Section B.  
This PWS establishes the minimum requirements necessary to overhaul the Pump Module Assemblies.  Required overhaul is to be accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Parker-Hannifin Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The contractors shall provide their own manuals as the Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide this data.
In order to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B, the contractor must have access to the parts and data furnished directly by the OEM.  Proposals shall include evidence of the foregoing access.  Piece parts shall be new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Data includes complete overhaul manuals and service bulletins of the latest revisions required to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS.  The following technical and operational directives are applicable to this requirement but are not deliverable under this contract.  Except where otherwise noted, the latest revision in effect as of contract award date applies. The information contained in this section is not intended to be all-inclusive nor to detract from or modify procedures outlined in the manufacturers drawings, specifications and service bulletins, except where specifically noted herein. 

3.1. MANUFACTURERS DRAWING AND SPECIFICATIONS:  The contractor shall have access to the latest required maintenance, overhaul manuals, and Original Equipment Manufacturer's Drawings, Specifications and Service Bulletins to ensure that equipment is overhauled, calibrated and operating in accordance with latest manufacturer's performance/test/acceptance specification criteria.  Drawings and specifications are proprietary and are not available from the Coast Guard.  Coast Guard does not possess nor can it supply the aforementioned.  The offeror will be responsible for obtaining all data.

3.2.  SERVICE BULLETINS:  The contractor shall be required to incorporate service bulletins issued prior to the date of contract if not previously accomplished.  The service bulletins will fall under overhaul to be accomplished in accordance with Original Equipment Manufacturer's latest commercial build standard and shall be included in the proposed overhaul price.
  
New service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this contract may create new part number configurations, i.e., Class II changes, which will not change form, fit or function, will be replaced on an attrition basis unless directed by an Airworthiness Directive.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the overhaul contract.  If applicable, contractor will provide within the 30-day period a flat rate overhaul price for the new part number to cover the remaining option years.  Superseded parts, which have been removed, and replaced by new part number configurations are to be scrapped at contractor's facility in the presence of a DCMAO inspector or Coast Guard designated COTR.

4.0.  DEFINITIONS.  For the purpose of this contract, the following definitions apply:

4.1.  OVERHAUL:  To restore to original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) minimum functional performance specifications by disassembling, inspection, overhaul, assembly and testing of parts or components in accordance with OEM's current specifications and procedures.

4.2.  REPLACEMENT:  The substitution of a scrapped, consumable item with a new item manufactured or approved by the OEM or an unserviceable item which cannot be overhauled in accordance with OEM specifications shall be replaced with new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Other than new replacement parts will need prior Contracting Officer approval.

4.3.  UNUSUAL DAMAGE:  Items which have been severely damaged due to mishandling, mechanical failure or crash damage, or in which assemblies have been cannibalized.  Items, which are missing consumable components, that are required to be replaced during overhaul, are not considered to be unusually damaged.

4.4.  CANNIBALIZED:  Components listed in Section B for which integral parts are missing when the component is provided to the contractor for overhaul.

4.5.  MODIFICATION:  To make basic or fundamental changes on items specified in the schedule of components when required by the Contracting Officer.  The vendor shall also include the part number affixed to the modification.  The contractor must be able to perform upgrades/modifications at the same time as the OEM, if contractor is other than the OEM.

4.6.  B.E.R. Beyond Economical Overhaul:  Items requiring overhaul to the extent that the total cost to overhaul exceeds 75% of the OEM’s new replacement cost, will be considered B.E.R.

4.7.  AOG:  An  “Aircraft on the Ground” condition, indicating that an otherwise operational aircraft is temporarily grounded awaiting overhaul and return of the part or component.  This condition requires the component be handled as a high priority, and that its return be expedited.

4.8.	QUALIFICATION OF PIECE PARTS:  The aircraft engine, and its components are 
considered “flight safety critical aircraft parts”.  The use of piece parts or components other than OEM or DOD approved parts is prohibited without prior express written approval of the Contracting Officer.

5.1	     RECEIPT OF ITEMS:  

5.1.1.	Pump Assemblies and Components:  Upon receipt of repairable items, the contractor
shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing, providing the following information:  (1) date the reparable(s) received; (2) confirmation of serial number(s); (3) confirmation of delivery order number.  Notification via facsimile is acceptable.  If ACMS tracked, identify at this time any components requiring configuration upgrading (modification).  Ensure SCHR and CCRR correspond with component and conduct an inspection IAW manufacturer's specifications.  In addition, when the component is received at the overhaul facility receiving dock, the contractor shall report any preservation or packaging discrepancies, missing parts or assemblies, cannibalized items or unusual damage to the Contracting Officer.

5.1.1.1.  Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked Material:  If a component is ACMS tracked material the contractor shall; 

5.1.1.1.1.  Review the Significant Component History Record (SCHR) for Gas Turbine Assemblies for accuracy and completion.  Report any preservation or packaging discrepancies or missing parts to the Contracting Officer.

5.1.1.1.2.  Initiate a Contract Component Overhaul Record (CCRR) on serial number tracked parts.  The form entry must include the specific reason for component rejection, both primary and secondary if applicable.

5.1.1.1.3.   Annotate CCRR, listing Service Bulletins, which have been incorporated.

5.1.1.2.  Missing Components:  Within 30 calendar days after receipt of a component, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of any missing detail part(s) or sub-assembly(ies).  The Contracting Officer shall then have 45 calendar days to provide formal disposition instructions to the contractor.  The U. S. Coast Guard will be responsible to replace the missing detail part with an RFI or repaired detail part.  A revised contract delivery schedule will be negotiated.

 5.1.1.3.  Cannibalized Components:  Upon receiving components exhibiting cannibalization, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR and discontinue all actions until the Contracting Officer determines to proceed with the overhaul/overhaul.  DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR shall witness the remaining teardown and inspection of the component and shall be responsible for signing and dating the Contractor’s letter of notification.  DCMAO’s or Coast Guard designated COTR’s signature does not infer acceptance, only acknowledges the claim.  The letter of notification and the inspection/teardown report shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for disposition.  If overhaul is subsequently authorized, the contractor shall follow the procedures outlined in 5.2.

5.1.1.4.	Unusual Damage:  When components are received and the contractor's inspection
indicates obvious misuse, unusual or severe damage, the contractor shall discontinue all actions until a DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR is notified and personally witnesses the continuance of inspection and tear down.  The DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR will be responsible to sign and date the Contractor's Unusual Damage Claim Request.

5.1.1.4.1.  The contractor shall, within fifteen calendar days from date the DCMAO representative or Coast Guard designated COTR witnesses the unusual damage, notify the Contracting Officer that the item is considered unusually damaged and requires an unusual damage evaluation.

 5.1.1.4.2.  The contractor shall, within thirty days from DCMAO or Coast Guard designated COTR verification, submit an Unusual Damage Report and a detailed breakdown covering all parts and overhaul needed to return the unit to the manufacturer's minimum performance specifications.  The detailed breakdown shall contain the National Stock Number (NSN), Part Number (P/N), Nomenclature, serial number, cost breakdown, and a list of replacement parts and disposition of each.  The proposal shall not include the work involved in the tear down/inspection process, as this would have been covered under the firm fixed teardown price.

 5.1.1.4.3.  Within thirty calendar days of receipt of Unusual Damage Report and proposal, the Contracting Officer will either authorize or deny overhaul or initiate negotiations.  Upon mutual agreement as to price, the delivery order will be modified by a supplemental agreement.  If it is in the Coast Guard's best interest not to have material overhauled, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with disposition instructions to return the material to the Aircraft Repair & Supply Center.   NOTE:  The contractor is at sole risk if material is overhauled prior to Contracting Officer's approval to commence overhaul.

5.2.	 OVERHAUL:  The Contractor shall make necessary repairs to unserviceable
components to return to a serviceable condition as set forth in accordance with Section 2.0 this PWS.  Replace only those parts found missing or defective.  Parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be reused.

5.2.1.	BEYOND ECONOMICAL REPAIR REQUIREMENT:  The contractor shall provide
actual component repair breakdown and costs when overhaul of the material exceeds 75% of the OEM's new replacement cost. This information will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer who will provide final disposition.   

5.2.2.  NON-REPAIRABLE DETAIL PARTS:  The contractor shall dispose of any part
removed as non-repairable during the overhaul or modification process in accordance with the current ISO 9002 certified procedures.  All ACMS tracked detailed components shall be properly documented on the Disenrollment Card #2572020,submitted IAW Section 5.1.1.1.2.

5.2.3.  CORROSION:  Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. The contractor is advised to expect corrosion on equipment to be overhauled under this requirement. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in an assembly or component thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with OEM's current specifications and drawings, or shall meet the Contracting Officer's approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not clear. The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the firm-fixed overhaul price.

5.3.	ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE TEST:  The contractor shall reassemble all
components upon completion of overhaul and conduct a performance test in accordance with the applicable directive(s) cited in Section 3.0.  The contractor shall record the results of all performance tests and provide this documentation to the government upon request.

 5.1.1.4.3.  Within thirty calendar days of receipt of Unusual Damage Report and proposal, the Contracting Officer will either authorize or deny overhaul or initiate negotiations.  Upon mutual agreement as to price, the delivery order will be modified by a supplemental agreement.

Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with OEM's current specifications and drawings, or shall meet the Contracting Officer's approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not clear. The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the firm-fixed overhaul price.

5.3.	ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE TEST:  The contractor shall reassemble all
components upon completion of overhaul and conduct a performance test in accordance with the applicable directive(s) cited in Section 3.0.  The contractor shall record the results of all performance tests and provide this documentation to the government upon request.
