<CONTACT>Lynn G. White, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-4996, Fax (315) 330-8120, Email Lynn.White@rl.af.mil
<DESC><p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 10-05-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The objective of the Planning, Scheduling and Assessing Space Command and Control (C2) Operations BAA is to provide the Space Operations Centers with the ability to plan, task, synchronize, execute and assess the effectiveness of space capabilities to achieve desired effects within the battle space. This BAA represents the space component of the Command and Control Core Technical Competency's (C2 CTC) Integrated C2 concept.</p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate technologies which will enable Space Superiority. Space Superiority can be defined as efficient, timely integration of space situational awareness (SSA) and command and control (C2) in order to more effectively task space control capabilities. Space C2 functions enable commanders to plan, direct, coordinate, synchronize and control operations of assigned forces. Technologies are needed for improvement of Space Operations at the strategic, operational and tactical levels, in the areas of planning, tasking, execution and assessment capabilities associated with the space tasking cycle starting with commander's intent and ending with assessment. White papers are being sought that provide enhanced event monitoring and task execution, situational assessment, automated decision aids for better course of action analysis and selection, dynamic resource management, timely feedback to assess effectiveness of on-going global operations and agile C2 enterprise management system approaches to allow more adaptable and resilient operations to systems degradations or limited available resources. Technologies must be compatible with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and clearly demonstrate Measure of Performance (MOP) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) of the end product.</p>
<p>Developing innovative and critical technologies necessary to enhance the planning, scheduling and assessing of Space C2 capabilities and the ability to provide a seamless path to overall integration with air, and cyber C2 assets synchronized to achieve effects globally in support of theater commanders are desired.</p>
<p>This BAA is comprised of the following areas of which an offeror may respond to one or more:</p>
<p>1.0 Effects Based Planning and Scheduling for Space Operations</p>
<p>Decision-makers must have a clear idea of what it is they are trying to accomplish, what actions might be taken and how the proposed actions will contribute to some desired end state. They must also have some reasonable explanation of why they expect the operations to work. It is critical that we determine that the action or actions taken are creating the effect we want both spatially and temporally. Prior to and after the fact, as we perform actions, we want to make sure that our battle space understanding is still relevant (Did the situation change). This change may negate the effect we want to achieve from the actions planned. To determine this, we need to be collecting robust space situational awareness (SSA) information combined with other information sources to assure ourselves that the effects that we are trying to achieve are obtainable. We need all source fusion of information to reach timely situation awareness and knowledge. Finally, agility will be the key to success. We need to dynamically and in time synchronize our actions to achieve desired effects.</p>
<p>This focus area is soliciting innovative approaches to develop a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant capability for space C2 Course of Action (COA) planning and evaluation for use in real world, exercise, and training situations. The system capability should aid the operator in determining the feasibility of the plan/COA to achieve the commander's intent. Key capability is to enable the planner to apportion low density, high demand resources to meet global needs. Novel approaches are encouraged that will allow operators to easily interact with the capability and develop credible results while managing uncertainty. Key metrics are machine to machine population of model parameters, agility to handle different scenarios, use of templates/knowledge bases to speed planning process, and understandable results clearly showing risk/benefits of each COA developed and analyzed.</p>
<p>2.0 Assessment</p>
<p>Assessment can be loosely defined as the ability to understand the status of our capabilities with respect to natural (weather) or manmade anomalies as well as effects we intend to achieve as a result of our actions. Key to analyzing these effects will be the ability to clearly define well understood Measures of Effective (MOE) and Measures of Performance (MOP). Related to this capability is the need to track and monitor use of our resources and make adjustments in response to the dynamics of the situation. This focus area is soliciting approaches for the means to accurately define the effects that can be achieved based on resources available and objectives, which in turn drives indicators of achievement of those effects, which in turn will drive the need to accommodate any plan changes. Novel approaches for achieving mission assurance against all anomalies to ensure successful operations are of interest. Furthermore, the capabilities developed must address the dynamic feedback between planning, execution and assessment.</p>
<p>3.0 Common Integrated Flexible Satellite Operations (SATOPS) Command &amp; Control (C2)</p>
<p>Many C2 challenges exist with the current SATOPS enterprise such as lack of standardization and divergent stovepipe implementations of SATOPS for specific systems. These stand alone designs hinder the ability to accomplish cross-mission data fusion, prevent application reuse and sharing, and create the need for manpower-intensive operations. A common integrated flexible SATOPS C2 capability that could combine tasks common to multiple SATOPS systems, share mission data for integration within a SOA, and be flexible enough for both future expansion and incorporation of legacy systems is desired. This focus area is soliciting approaches in three areas: (1) - Research that explores the data sharing architecture most suited to handle worldwide, multi-user, high bandwidth, near real time distribution of satellite data over secure networks; (2) - Research that explores consolidated C2 systems flexible enough to execute mission requirements for legacy systems, recently fielded systems, and future systems; and (3) - Research that explores the best combination of bus and payload C2 functions to consolidate and to minimize both manpower and training. Research should explore recommendations of in-family satellite systems (SATCOM, Weather, Missile Warning, PNT, and Imagery) and cross-family recommendations.</p>

<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 10-03 - RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Fusion and Understanding (IFU) Core Technical Competency (CTC) is defined as the continuous process that provides world-wide situational awareness in order to enable decision superiority.</p>
<p>The focus area of this BAA is to research, develop, demonstrate, integrate and test innovative technologies in support of the IFU CTC which enable continuous assessment of global conditions and events; establish and maintain battle space situational awareness (including an understanding of adversarial capabilities and intent); and that locate, identify, and track red, blue, and gray forces anywhere, anytime in near real-time.</p>
<p>This BAA is comprised of the following focus areas of which an offeror may respond to one or more areas:</p>
<p>1.0 REASONING AND LEARNING</p>
<p>Most automated reasoning and learning techniques rely heavily on well-defined models of the domain of interest. Development of these models is often a manual process requiring input from both experts and knowledge engineers to ensure the model is both expressive and functional. We seek new methods for building and extending models from data and providing a mapping of new information to existing models.</p>
<p>1.1 Targeted Perception</p>
<p>With the large amount of data available from a wide range of sources it is infeasible to map all collected information to concepts that have been modeled in a structured format. Because domain models often contain concepts that are fixed, new information must be mapped to these concepts to be used for reasoning. Additionally, there may be constraints on resources, such as limited collection windows or storage limits that require targeted collection of information that would best support the goals of the reasoning process. The intent is to support collection, refinement, storage and presentation of information in a form that supports reasoning over a model of a domain. Challenges include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Extracting and retrieving information that is relevant to provided models.</p>
<p>&bull; Mapping extracted concepts to existing knowledge structures. Tracking the state of concepts over time.</p>
<p>&bull; Generalizing concepts, relations and instances.</p>
<p>&bull; Satisficing of information collection under dynamic constraints</p>
<p>We seek new algorithms for information extraction, mapping and generalization driven by the models provided to the system.</p>
<p>1.2 Model Elicitation</p>
<p>Domain models are often developed by an expert or community of interest but will not necessarily be sufficient for all tasks in that domain. It's likely that information will exist that can not be mapped to defined concepts. Additionally, the domain itself may change over time and require constant updates. Small changes to a model can often have serious impact on the reasoning process. Models can not be exhaustive and, as a result, they could potentially lack the necessary information to be sufficiently expressive. Challenges include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Creating and evolving models from iterative inputs.</p>
<p>&bull; Validating and verifying models based on expert review, user input, and data confirmation.</p>
<p>&bull; Representing uncertainty. A distinction should be made between uncertainty about the correctness of the values, and uncertainty regarding the correctness of the model itself.</p>
<p>&bull; Detecting and negotiating inconsistencies, to allow for differing values within the same model and allowing for intentional inconsistency.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensuring changes to a model do not invalidate past assertions.</p>
<p>&bull; Providing clear and concise explanations of the effects of changes to the structure of the model.</p>
<p>We seek algorithms for mixed-initiative development, manipulation, and maintenance of computational models to support reasoning. These technologies will aid in the discovery of the structure and parameters of new or incomplete models. In addition to providing support for uncertainty and inconsistency, solutions should include support for describing rationale, provenance, and trust.</p>
<p>2.0 COMPREHENSION</p>
<p>Comprehension technologies seek to develop capabilities for quantitative evaluation of events that enhance a decision maker's ability to judge, appraise, and determine the relevance of emerging situations.</p>
<p>2.1 Link and Group Discovery (LGD)<br /><br />This area is focused on techniques for analyzing large collections of data to discover valuable knowledge that may be present as hidden patterns or links among seemingly unrelated items. LGD will discover the hidden structure of organizations, relate groups, identify fraudulent behavior, model group activity, connect bits of information into patterns that can be evaluated and analyzed, learn what patterns discriminate between legitimate and suspicious behavior, and provide early detection of emerging threats. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following areas:</p>
<p>2.1.1 Dynamic Networks Over Time</p>
<p>Most networks of entities and relationships change over time. Computers connect and disconnect from the internet. Web pages and hyperlinks appear and disappear from the worldwide web. People enter and leave social networks. Leaders emerge and then disappear. Many approaches have been developed to detect patterns in static snapshots of these networks, but discovering patterns in the dynamics of these networks can provide new understanding of how they evolve and new ways to categorize networks based on their dynamics.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that networks influence both individual and collective group activity. Networks play a key role in determining how information is disseminated and how organizations evolve (e.g., how new members are recruited and how they leave). Additionally, these networks have a significant impact on the choices an individual makes. These observations apply not only to social, but also to geospatial, information and technological networks. Despite growing interest in social network analysis (SNA) and related fields, an understanding of how these networks influence individuals and groups is still very limited. The objective of this technology area is to research and develop:</p>
<p>- Methods for combining the effects of multiple, heterogeneous networks within a single model as well as mathematical methods and formalisms for modeling dynamic networks and their influence on the individual and group dynamics.</p>
<p>- Methods for combining different sources of evidence, how to include spatio-temporal data, and how the community structure changes over time.</p>
<p>- Enhanced techniques for social network modeling beyond static models. Develop techniques capable of handling dynamic models that account for relationships that drift over time and tractable to learn such models from data, even as the number of entities gets large.</p>
<p>- Metrics to assess and identify change within and across networks.</p>
<p>- Techniques to determine whether differences observed over time in networks are due simply to different samples from a distribution of links and nodes or due to changes over time in the underlying distribution of links and nodes.</p>
<p>The end goal is to understand the entire problem space well enough to predict/forecast change in existing networks. Managing the pedigree of the information must be addressed in order to accurately combine information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Abnormality Detection in Counter Terrorism Evidence</p>
<p>Anomaly detection looks for entities whose characteristics, behaviors or connections to other individuals are in some way abnormal. Particular patterns of abnormality are not typically available, and therefore must be derived from data which is normal, by identifying deviations from "normal" patterns. Often it is the combination of several seemingly normal things that is abnormal.</p>
<p>Much of today's evidence consists of networks of entities and their interrelationships. However, most approaches for detecting abnormalities in this evidence consider only the attributes of the entities, or focus on the presence or absence of specific relationships, without considering the context of the abnormality. For example, in the case of fraud, the perpetrator attempts to mimic normal behavior in order to avoid detection. That is, abnormality only makes sense in the context of what is normal. In the case of networks, normal behavior can be represented by recurring normative patterns in the structure of the network, and abnormalities can be defined as unexpected deviations to these normative patterns, not just unexpected deviations within the network as a whole. In addition to methods for detecting outlier attributes and relationships, we also need methods for detecting anomalies to the prevalent, normal behavior reflected in the transactions among entities in the domain of interest. Such methods will provide several benefits, including the description of abnormalities within the context of the normal behavior they defy and the ability to detect these abnormalities without prior training in possible abnormalities; thus, providing the ability to detect previously unforeseen abnormalities. Combining these methods with the above methods on detecting patterns in dynamic networks will provide the ability to detect anomalies in both the structure and the dynamics of networks.</p>
<p>Single anomalies are often the result of noise, data mistakes, or other one-time-only phenomena and do not have significant practical interest. Identifying a collection of records that are each anomalous, but have some pattern of self-similarity, may make them indicative of a larger event. For example, a single strange case in the hospital emergency department is probably nothing more than that, but several of these across a city are indicative of a disease outbreak, or potential malicious activity. Research and development is needed to extend traditional anomaly detection methods to link data to discover linked groups of anomalous records along with efficient methods to scale this up to millions of links. This will enable discovery of linked groups of individuals engaged in anomalous activity, even if none are previously known to be dangerous, or the method of attack they are pursuing is novel.</p>
<p>Many times there are simply too many unique or rare events to make it useful to identify them all (not to mention having to determine how rare an event needs to be before it is reported). Sherlock Holmes stories typically see the detective observe a multitude of things that seem perfectly ordinary until he puts their significance together to solve the crime. Research and develop techniques to recognize situations of potential interest, and to tell a story that explains why the situations are of potential interest, without those situations having been predefined in detail. Develop models of relevancy. An abnormality that can be explained away through a simple non-threatening story should not be reported. Conversely, an abnormality that cannot be explained with a non-threatening story, or supports a threatening or opportunistic story should be reported. Develop capability to recognize situations of potential interest and explain why the situations are of interest, without those situations having been predefined in detail.</p>
<p>2.2 Situation Analysis (SA). The objective of the SA area is to research and develop capabilities for comprehensive, integrated and continuous awareness of activities, systems and the environment across Air, Space and Cyber domains. This includes developing software tools that provide computational techniques to support the analysis of identities, behaviors, intentions, capability, capacity, kinematics, activity level, and saliences.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Space Situation Awareness. <br /><br />2.2.1.1 Space Situation Awareness includes perception, comprehension and anticipation of threats against blue (including coalition) space assets (satellites and their ground stations). Space threats encompass non-kinetic and kinetic attacks. Examples of non-kinetic threats include laser dazzling, RF jamming and cyber attacks against satellites and/or their command &amp; control ground stations. Examples of kinetic threats include Direct Assent Anti-Satellite Ballistic Missile (DA-ASAT) and Co-Orbital ASAT kinetic kill vehicles (KKV) in Low Earth Orbits (LEO), Medium Earth Orbits (MEO) and Geostationary Orbits (GEO). Space threats may be executed by multiple adversaries through simultaneous, coordinated attacks against multiple ground stations and satellites in the constellation (eg, a DA-ASAT attack against Satellite X by country A teamed with country B who is concurrently attacking Satellite Y by laser dazzling &amp; RF jamming). The objective of this technology area is to research and develop:</p>
<p>- Dynamic automated adversary modeling and alerting techniques which are needed to provide watch agencies', analysts and operators with enough advanced warning of coordinated attacks against multiple DoD (Department of Defense), National and commercial space assets in sufficient time for successful Defensive Counterspace (DCS) actions.</p>
<p>- Automated learning and reasoning approaches mentioned in 1.0 can be applied to the space domain. Automated space asset attack assessment indicates the probability and type of space asset attack, which coalition (air, ground, maritime, cyber) assets are vulnerable, the vulnerability period, and the confidence levels associated with the assessment. The impact of an attack needs to be understood as well as the effect asset degradation/failure has on coalition (air, ground, maritime, and cyber) operations so as to ensure unhindered integrated Command and Control (C2) of coalition forces.</p>
<p>2.2.1.2 Space Tracking and Object Characterization is an area of research to include, but not limited to, novel algorithms for automatic tracking of satellites to minimize the number of uncorrelated tracks on space objects, and decipher between debris and satellites.</p>
<p>- Novel techniques are needed in multi-source data (radar, optical and other) exploitation, analysis and fusion capabilities for timely, accurate and complete characterization of space objects, physical and functional analysis, events and situation assessment, threat determination and appropriate course of action development.</p>
<p>- High fidelity tools to fit into RI simulation environment are needed for satellite modeling, assessment of satellite vulnerabilities related to particular threats, automated classification of unknown or wrongly labeled space objects and corresponding probable mission. Research and development methods include physics based modeling and analysis of photometric and multispectral satellite signatures, improved detection, tracking, enhanced orbital cataloging, and characterization of satellite threats.</p>
<p>2.3 Multimedia Information Extraction</p>
<p>There are separate research programs directed at detecting or highlighting information elements from each of text, audio, still imagery, and motion imagery by computer analysis. Information, however, is very often relayed via multimedia products. Videotapes, for example, include motion imagery and coordinated audio components, and often include screen text. Understanding the information content of a multimedia communication cannot be done by fully processing each of the individual communication modes independently and then fusing the results. Each of the individual modalities often expresses only part of a message and the integration of those complementary modalities results in a more complete account. For example, newspaper photographs usually have associated captions describing the image contents. Neither the image nor the accompanying text alone is sufficient for understanding the information being relayed. Also, often, there is a redundancy of information across the modalities that can be used to increase the accuracy of content understanding. Redundancy is when two or more modalities convey the exact same information, thus strengthening confidence in the correctness of the analysis.</p>
<p>Research in information extraction from each of the modalities of communication has progressed to varying degrees of capability. Some modality capabilities are more limited than others but there have been technology advances in each of them. Integrating the analyses of the different modalities, which is different from integrating the results of each analysis, will support automatic, computer-based information extraction from multimedia resources. The goal of multimedia information extraction is to improve the quality and quantity of information extracted from multimedia sources, and potentially, provide new ideas and direction for research for each of the component media analysis areas.</p>
<p>For example, the initial success of text extraction technology was focused on identifying named entities in documents. This approach, although not limited to such, could serve as an initial jumping off place for multimedia information extraction. The synchronized text, audio, and motion imagery from broadcast video could be processed to detect named entity references and co-reference expressions from the audio and on-screen text, and deictic references from the image to provide an improved understanding of the broadcast topics. As a result of the processing synergy from the integrated analysis, the amount and quality of the analysis should be measurably increased over separate media analyses</p>
<p>This topic area is directed toward analyzing the synchronized text, audio and motion imagery from multimedia sources to identify and assimilate named entity references, co-reference expressions and deictic references to achieve measurably improved recognition of references to people, places and things.</p>
<p>3.0 ANTICIPATION</p>
<p>The intent of this area is to develop technologies which provide a detailed understanding of probable intent and future strategy in order to identify the set of potential courses of action (COAs) that both our adversaries and other entities' commanders have to consider while taking actions. Determine their most likely COAs, their COAs which have the greatest detrimental impact, and their most likely reactions to our COAs.</p>
<p>The vision is to provide the Decision Maker (DM) and their staff greater awareness into the range of alternate futures (state &amp; non-state actors); and to assist them in exploring the realm of the plausible in order to support: greater understanding of current conditions and possible outcomes (impact and plausibility); more robust/targeted courses of actions; better insight into potential ramifications of planned blue actions; greater variance in training scenarios for blue forces, minimizing surprise, while bounding the realm of the possible (better preparing our forces); better utilization of limited ISR resources; and an increased insight into what the adversary can/is doing against various blue assets/missions (to support fight through). This area cuts across and supports all Air Force domains (Air, Space, &amp; Cyber).</p>
<p>3.1 Understanding the Operational Environment (Nation-state)</p>
<p>The intent is to provide a Strategic Analysis/Assessment Tool that provides insight into the complex state space that is today's modern operational environment. In other words, given the current state of affairs within a specific region (or nation-state), what are the short, mid and long-term forecasts of its security, social, physical, and government support mechanisms and (stability) behavior.</p>
<p>Technology challenges include the ability to completely model complex regional and national environmental states (to include all factors and their inter-relationships) and to support the Blue Commander's ability to interact/investigate multiple options of achieving his "objectives." This is not to develop the blue COA but to support its development. The development is a Command and Control (C2) responsibility; large-scale multi-dimensional heuristics capable of identifying decision/leverage points; visualization methods that allow understanding of highly complex and multi-dimensional models; multi-constraint objective analysis; social-cultural modeling; behavioral modeling; integrated analysis tools that support rapid modeling and simulation of plausible futures based on continuous assessment of behavioral and environmental conditions; and methods to integrate discrete near and far term forecasting capabilities into a single service architecture application with near-real time analysis capability.</p>
<p>3.2 Understanding Adversary Behavior</p>
<p>The intent is to develop an operational/tactical analysis and assessment tool that forecasts potential adversaries' actions and events based on indications of known evidence and projected known and/or anticipated threat(s).</p>
<p>Technology challenges include: the integration of broad-spectrum adversarial modeling (individual to societal behaviors, infrastructure, and cyber); advancement of predictive sciences (constructive simulation, analytical methods); analysis of implications of the adversary's actions (based on capability, intent and opportunity) to identify potential threat(s); capabilities to project adversary courses of action; and ability to rank order potential actions as part of an adversary's COA as well as support to collection requirements.</p>
<p>4.0: PERCEPTION</p>
<p>The intent of this area is to develop technologies which fuse multiple intelligence sources to provide awareness of all elements of the current battle space situation, including single entities, groups, and activities. Accurate perception of the battle space is a key enabler for both comprehension of the current situation and anticipation of future enemy actions, thus enabling a commander to make better decisions.</p>
<p>A major focus of the area is the ability to locate, identify, track and observe/monitor friendly, enemy, non-friendly, and non-aligned forces/actors anywhere/anytime in near real-time. Another concentration is on the development of forensic capabilities to analyze historical multi-INT data to enable more accurate perception of the current situation. This includes automated motion and behavioral pattern analysis, correlation of multi-INT data with social networks, and utilization of forensic data for sensor cueing. A final focus is on text extraction and understanding to determine entity profiles, define relationships, and identify events. Technology research and development in these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>4.1: Network Centric Multi-INT Fusion: The major focuses in this area include Multi-INT feature aided tracking (FAT), knowledge and reasoning based association, algorithm based association, non-linear tracking, track/sensor management, and onboard processing.</p>
<p>4.1.1: Multi-INT FAT: The intent is to develop new algorithms that utilize multi-INT features to overcome the lack of persistent surveillance, large collection gap times, and dense target environments (&gt;3 targets per sensor resolution cell) that result in ambiguous association conditions in Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms that utilize kinematics only. Examples of features include, but are not limited to, advanced radar features such as high range-resolution radar (HRR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), video imagery features such as color, shape and size, hyperspectral imagery features such as color and texture, ID features from SIGINT, and features obtained from HUMINT reports. FAT algorithms may utilize the features in combination with, or to augment the kinematic track state or to stitch pure kinematic tracklets after periods of kinematic confusion or extended sensor gaps. Algorithms which combine features into models such that cross-domain association (e.g. correlation of video with hyperspectral features) can occur are also sought. <br /><br />Algorithms are also sought for the specific case of extracting and combining multiple-features from multiple, homogeneous and heterogeneous video sensors in dense target environments to obtain longer, more accurate tracks. The key to this type of fusion is interoperability between the video sensors and sensors from other tracking sources such as non-imagery derived information sources. It is the current practice for the user to click on an object/pixel for manual nomination. The user is essentially telling the computer to track the selected object. The goal of the feature aided tracking portion of the effort would be to eliminate this bottleneck by devising algorithms that automatically perform this process and combine the results with other intelligence sources, such as MOVINT data.</p>
<p>4.1.2: Knowledge and Reasoning Based Association: The objective is to develop new methods and algorithms to overcome the factors discussed in 4.1.1 that limit Multi-INT tracking and fusion performance. Previous research has shown that augmenting traditional association methods with knowledge and reasoning based association algorithms shows great promise to increase tracking performance in difficult conditions. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to knowledge based reasoning and learning, adductive and deductive reasoning, context based association and other heuristic techniques. Of specific interest are context based techniques which utilize information such as geospatial features, traffic models, cultural data, and forensically derived motion and behavioral patterns to aid the association problem.</p>
<p>4.1.3: Non-linear tracking: In this area of research, measures of nonlinearity have been explored to determine which non-linear tracking filter to use under various conditions. In fact, a filter swapping suite has been tried, and significant improvements were demonstrated. However, there is a much broader spectrum of nonlinear filters that can be employed, and advanced computing resources to exploit. The work in nonlinear filters needs to be expanded to consider vehicle dynamic models and new ways of predicting the performance of particle filters, Unscented Kalman Filters, and Extended Kalman Filters and other nonlinear tracking filters when used in conjunction with each other. <br /><br />4.1.4: Track/Sensor Management: The objective is to develop algorithms to manage sensor resources to maintain track on all targets in the battle space and maintain a consistent track picture. Sensor management techniques may be developed to manage multiple modes on a single sensor or multiple modes and sensor modalities across multiple platforms. For the latter case, centralized or distributed techniques may be utilized, but either must ensure that track pedigree information is maintained and a consistent track numbering scheme for outputting tracks is developed. Also of specific interest are sensor resource management techniques that balance the requirements between forensics and high value target tracking (i.e. short pure tracklets on all surveillance tracks vice extended-duration track on a smaller subset of targets).</p>
<p>4.1.5: Onboard processing: High resolution sensor platforms such as Constant Hawk, Angel Fire and proposed sensor platforms such as Gorgon Stare and Argus produce large amounts of data that can cause latency and information availability issues due to bandwidth limitations. The intent is to develop algorithms that can be implemented onboard the sensor platform and produce relevant information, requiring minimal bandwidth, so that this information can be distributed to a wide variety of users with minimal latency.</p>
<p>4.2: Moving Target Indicator (MTI) Analysis: Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Video: Automated Adaptive Pattern Recognition. The objective of this topic is to explore, identify, and prototype innovative approaches that process multiple movement based event streams to detect patterns and trends in real time or near real time. The ability to detect patterns in the flow of events will allow a proactive use of previously observed activity. The challenge is to provide these indicators and warnings for continually emerging tactics. Innovative algorithms are desired that will monitor all potential MOVINT data sources (S/GMTI, geospatial and temporal event info, coalition traffic patterns from Blue Force data, maritime data like Automatic Identification System (AIS), etc) to generate alerts in an autonomous or semi-autonomous manner.</p>
<p>4.2.1: Low Flying Targets: One of the greatest challenges in the analysis of MTI data is accounting for low flying targets that appear in MTI data. The capability to extract the low flying targets from certain GMTI databases is desired. Also, ground looking radars and video sensors are used to track and classify air vehicles and surface vehicles. Many of these systems rely on the intervention of an analyst to track and classify air vehicles and surface vehicles. Automation of this process through the development of knowledge based heuristics to distinguish between ground targets and low-flying targets within these GMTI databases would greatly improve the state of the art. In addition, the use of Air Moving Target (AMTI) templates at the beam clutter edges of a side-looking airborne radar when combined with GMTI information would greatly enhance the capability to extract low fliers from MTI data.</p>
<p>4.3: IED Forensics: The major focuses in this area include leveraging historical-temporal agility, geospatial reasoning and cued exploitation, and social/MTI network correlation. Of specific interest are the following areas:</p>
<p>4.3.1: Movement Augmented Network Analysis: The objective is to develop automated tools to reciprocally influence both derived movement information and social network analysis (SNA) to define and exploit the structure and behavior of the enemy. The intent is to develop movement derived link analysis capabilities to establish probabilistic linkages between people, places, other entities, and events. The movement derived linkages would then be utilized as an additional information source for SNA. The intent is also to develop automated tools for improved group detection (i.e. terrorist cells) by incorporating MTI or SIGINT derived linkages and more traditional transactional and soft data. Additionally of interest are automated tools that can exploit and fuse the data and intelligence products cited above as context for GMTI analyses.</p>
<p>4.3.2: Activity Analysis: The objective of this effort is to establish the nature and intent of meeting events by combining kinematic analysis with behavior analysis and SNA for enhanced and timely situational analysis (SA). It will provide actionable information on activities (or lack of) based upon GMTI and SIGINT data thus enabling timely situational analysis updates. Approaches must develop activity level detection/kinematic analysis tools that incorporate and exploit geospatial and temporal data, develop meeting analyst/behavior analyst software tool(s) to establish the type of meeting, phase of operation and potential participants, and develop an approach for this domain to accrue evidence of the nature and intent of meeting, phase of operation, participants and update SA. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, automatic tracking, spatial scan statistics, and Bayesian Networks and Dempster-Shafer evidence accrual.</p>
<p>4.4: Text Understanding: The major focus of this area is to help analysts more effectively exploit the information in unstructured and semi-structured textual data, such as Intelligence message traffic (e.g., Human Intelligence reports (HUMINT)), open source intelligence (OSINT), chat, and Significant Activity Reports (SIGACTs). The goal is to help analysts find potentially relevant information within large collections of documents faster, and to put it in a structured form enabling the use of automated analysis and visualization (A&amp;V) tools. Information of interest to analysts includes entities ("things", such as people, locations, organizations, weapons, facilities, etc.), entity attributes, relationships between entities, and events.</p>
<p>4.4.1 Specific user capabilities of interest include enabling automated link analysis and visualization from information in unstructured text, enabling automated analysis and visualization of events on timelines and maps, the creation and update of cross-document entity profiles that consolidate all the information extracted on a given real-world entity from 1,000s of documents ("electronic dossiers"), and the creation of cross-document event profiles that consolidate all the information extracted on a given real-world event from 1,000s of documents. Multilingual extraction and translation is also of keen interest to end users. In addition, exploiting the information in certain types of textual data (e.g., chat) is of high interest to users.</p>
<p>4.4.2 A number of research areas need to be pursued to mature text extraction technology to support the aforementioned user capabilities. These include, but are not limited to, entity extraction technology gaps, within-document co-reference resolution, cross-document co-reference resolution, temporal analysis of events (time-stamping), location-stamping of events (geo-coding), discourse analysis, subjective information extraction, inferring non-explicit information from text, rapid domain porting/customization with minimal training data and user interaction, multilingual text extraction, and high-accuracy extraction of information from certain text types of high interest to our users, such as chat and SIGACTs.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, (NPPTL) Research Branch, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Gerry Odell Consulting to develop a new mathematical model and improve the performance of the existing software MultiVapor.
<p>Purpose and objective: This contract is expected to further the work of producing mathematical models to predict the service time of air purifying respirator cartridges.</p>
<p>Project Background: Mathematical modeling of air purifying respirator cartridges has been on going with Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dr. Gerry Wood since 2001. Dr. Gerry Wood has been the principle investigator on this project and since leaving Los Alamos has been a private consultant on the program. Work done thus far has resulted in three models. A single organic vapor with relative humidity model, a reactive gas model and a model for predicting service time of respirator cartridges for up to five vapors including the effects of relative humidity were produced. This contract will result in a new mathematical model which will permit first responders and the military to better predict the service life of air purifying respirator cartridges exposed to chemical warfare agents (CWAs).</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-11994. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Gerry Odell Consulting, 40 San Juan Street, Los Alamos, NM 87544 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice which includes but is not limited furnishing two prefabricated steel truss bridge structures to span across Dry Dock 3 at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, ME. The purpose of the bridge structures is for material handling in and out of the dry dock and to provide additional support for utilities.  The bridge structures will span approximately 88', and have a solid plate floor with elevated rollers for moving of materials across the bridge deck.  A partially enclosed high bay at mid-span, equipped with overhead crane rail and hoisting equipment to allow for material to be passed through a floor hatch.  Closure panels will be attached below the bridge structure to provide a weather-tight system while mating with other dry dock structures.  Also included are anchorages for the new structures, which include modifications to the gallery walls of the dry dock.  The new bridge structures are primarily built of tubular steel and in addition to the items listed above include ladders to the elevated bridge deck and to the high bay roof, fall protection components, outboard brackets to support utilities, and other features including corrosion resistant coating. Structure must be fabricated by an American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) certified fabricator. The work includes nondestructive testing and proof testing of lifting components.

However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, ES Defensive Systems Division, 1745A W. Nursery Road, Linthicum heights, MD  21090.  The BOA will cover a five-year period for spares, repairs, modifications, upgrades, engineering support, technical support, logistical support, assemblies, sub assemblies, ancillary equipment, system and subsystem integration of the AN/ALQ-218 .  The AN/ALQ-218 System covered includes the system as a whole, the individual Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs), the Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs), Support Equipment, Test Equipment and applicable system firmware.  Efforts will include Repair/Rework/and Maintenance, Spares and Replenishment, Engineering Support Services, Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification and Logistics Support Service as required.  Additional detailed guidance will be provided as implemented by specific job orders placed under the BOA. This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that the U.S Government has invested in excess of $200M into the development, test, and integration of the AN/ALQ-218 into the EA-18G and the majority of this cost and time would have to be duplicated since another vendor would have to repeat all laboratory, ground, and flight testing through full up EA-18G weapons systems performance flight testing to qualify substitute items.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to C4 Group LLC, 7510 Holley Circle, Panama City, Beach Florida to provide technical support for the installation of the Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG) and Infrasonic AAG (IAAG) on two MCM class ships. C4 Group's personnel have installed the AAG on six MCM ships.  C4 Group understands the intricacies of the installation jigs, molds, processes, and procedures for the installations.  NSWC Panama City Division estimates that the procedures C4 Group personnel developed decreased the installation time from 19 days to 10 days.  C4 Group's knowledge of the unique AAG installation coupled with their experience in MCM ship installations uniquely qualifies them to perform this SOW.  No other contractor will be able to duplicate the knowledge and installation processes to accomplish this installation in under 10 days without a substantial investment of time, money, personnel, and facilities.  These costs would not be recouped through competition. Simplified Acquisition is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 541330 with size standard of $4.5M.  The order shall be firm fixed priced with an expected delivery date of 30 Jan 2011.  The expected award date is 12 Mar 2010.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision "... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ..." The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking, and the availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy (DoN) missions. The current evolution of naval war fighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities of C2, sensor and weapon systems. These systems are deployed on a variety of platforms and users, both manned and unmanned, operating under challenging battlefield conditions (lack of infrastructure, mobility, spectrum, interference, multipath, atmospherics, size/weight/power constraint, etc.) in different environments (space, terrestrial and undersea).
Goal: The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Code 312 is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance end-to-end connectivity and quality-of-service for mission-critical information exchange among such widely dispersed naval, joint and coalition forces. The vision is to provide high throughput robust communications and networking to ensure all warfighters - from the operational command to the tactical edge - have access to information, knowledge, and decision-making necessary to perform their assigned tasks. Objective and Areas of Interest: White papers for potential FY11 Exploratory Development/Applied Research (Budget category 6.2) projects are sought under the following focus areas: 1. Metamaterials and metastructures for phased arrays (UHF, C and X bands), electrically small antennas (VLF to VHF) and parabolic reflector dish beam shaping (relevant SATCOM bands); 2. Advanced low complexity blind beam forming and jammer nulling algorithms/techniques; 3. Low-intercept and anti-jam tactical data link waveforms/networks with high throughput, scalability and low latency; 4. Alternatives to traditional satellite communications and network architectures for on-demand reach back; and 5. Predictive algorithms, models and tools for inferential network, as well as communication link, monitoring (such as recognize electronic attack on communication systems, etc.).
6. Novel concepts for software-defined antenna technologies (multi-resonant over wide bandwidths etc.). ONR is also receptive to highly innovative ideas in other general communications and networking areas that are not designated focus as above, but nonetheless important to Navy/Marine Corps, as determined under the synopsis section above.
Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein, the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university or by industry. ATD is funded through Budget Activity 3. In conformance with the USD (AT&L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity. As regards the present BAA, the Research and Development efforts to be funded consist of applied research. The funds available to support awards are Budget Activity 2. Contracts and grants made under this BAA are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000 the USACE will evaluate contractors performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system.

Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions. The certification software could cost approximately $110-$125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site: https://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to ACASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.<BR><BR>The Secretary of the Army Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) requirement will be incorporated into this contract. The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor personnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being supported.

The information provided in this announcement is the only information the Government has available at this time.  There are no specifications, drawings, bid packages, or source lists available.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. The offeror is required to submit their Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1201 via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. The ORCA must be completed prior to award.
The principal components of the work to be performed include:  
The Trinity River Restoration Program has the need for professional services covering fluvial geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrology/hydraulics on the Trinity River, California from 2010 through 2015.
Scope The Contractor shall conduct data collection and analysis to determine sediment transport, sediment storage, sediment budgets, substrate characteristics, topographic / bathymetric change, planform change, hydrology/hydraulics, and water quality. The scope and quantity of monitoring activities is highly dependant on stream flows and the water year type. The contractor shall also provide technical support services including, but not limited to, modeling, analysis, review, special studies, appraisal and feasibility level planning, concept engineering, and data management. 
All sediment transport monitoring and analysis shall comply with applicable protocols and standards from the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS). Sediment monitoring on the Trinity River requires specialized expertise and equipment, including the ability to take bedload and suspended load samples without the aid of a cableway or bridge in water velocities of up to 15 feet per second. The Contractor must be flexible to adapt to unanticipated changes in the flow releases, river conditions, and weather. 
Task 1 Safety ComplianceThe Contractor shall comply with all Reclamation Safety and Health Standards. A copy of the Reclamation Safety and Health Standards is available on the internet at http://www.usbr.gov/ssle/safety/RSHS/rshs.htm.
The Contractor shall annually prepare and submit a comprehensive written safety plan. The comprehensive safety plan shall: 1) comply with the Reclamation Safety and Health Standards; 2) describe required safety training for field staff (e.g. first aid, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, swift water rescue). The Contractor shall meet with the Trinity River Restoration Program Personnel (TRRP) annually to review the written safety plan. 
Task 2 Sediment Transport Monitoring The Contractor shall conduct sediment transport monitoring and analyses to determine suspended sediment and bedload transport rates, develop sediment transport curves, and determine total sediment loads by size fraction that represent the entire flood hydrograph. Sediment monitoring on the Trinity River requires specialized expertise and equipment, including the ability to take bedload and suspended load samples without the aid of a cableway or bridge in water velocities of up to 15 feet per second. The Contractor must be flexible to adapt to unanticipated changes in the flow releases, river conditions, and weather. The Trinity River has an average width of roughly 150 feet.
Sediment transport monitoring activities typically occur between the months of September and July and are dependant on stream flow and water year type. Flow on the mainstem Trinity River between Lewiston Dam and the North Fork Trinity River is usually dominated by releases from Lewiston Dam with the exception of large winter storm events. Flow in the tributary streams is dominated by weather conditions and storm events. Total flow in the mainstem Trinity River is a combination of releases from Lewiston Dam and tributary accretions. Historic stream flow information for the Trinity River and selected tributaries is available for download from the internet at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/inventory?huc_cd=18010211.  
Mainstem sediment transport monitoring shall be conducted in Dry, Normal, Wet, and Extremely Wet water years for flow releases exceeding 2,000 cfs (the approximate threshold for initiation of sediment transport). Trinity River releases exceeding 2,000 cfs fall into two categories: Safety of Dams (SOD) releases that can occur anytime during the winter and spring months; and spring flow releases for restoration purposes. Spring flow releases are typically scheduled between April and July and will generally follow the release schedules recommended in the ROD. The volume of water available for release to the Trinity River (and estimated peak flow rates) is determined by the water year type. It is anticipated that mainstem sediment monitoring in shall be required between 0 and 15 consecutive and/or non-consecutive days, depending on the water year type as shown in Table 1. On average, sampling days will include 2 weekend days and 1 holiday per year.
The water year type is determined near April 8th. On or before April 20th, TRRP will recommend to the Bureau of Reclamation an annual flow schedule from Lewiston Dam for the remainder of the water year. Flow releases typically begin on April 22nd. The Bureau of Reclamation has final authority over all dam operations and may choose to conduct flow releases from Lewiston Dam in a manner different than TRRP recommendations. TRRP will coordinate with the Contractor during the flow scheduling process. TRRP will give the Contractor 48 hour notification for sediment monitoring in the event of a Safety of Dams release.
On sampling days, synoptic sediment sampling shall be conducted concurrently at the four (4) monitoring locations shown in Table 2. It is anticipated that one (1) suspended sample and three (3) bedload samples can be collected per day per site. All sediment transport monitoring and analysis shall comply with applicable protocols and standards from the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) and be compatible and comparable with past sediment data and analysis for the Trinity River. Past methods and analysis are described in the Trinity River WY 2006 Sediment Transport Monitoring Final Report and Technical Appendix available for download at http://iims.trrp.net/. The Contractor shall mobilize equipment and prepare monitoring sites in such a manner to allow sediment sampling to be conducted in an efficient and safe manner while not hindering boat navigation. At the end of annual sediment monitoring activities, the Contractor shall demobilize and clean-up all monitoring sites.
Final flow data from the USGS streamflow gages listed in Table 2 for the period October 1st through July 31st of the current water year is available after September 1st to the Contractor upon request from the USGS. 
Task 2.1 Ancillary Information The Contractor shall annually conduct a cross-section survey and pebble count at every sampling site, both pre and post high flow release (see Task 3 for survey methods). During sediment sampling days, the Contractor shall obtain one (1) water surface profile measurement from fixed staff plate readings at least once daily at all sites. The fixed staff plates shall be installed both upstream and downstream of the sampling cross-section so as to provide a representative water surface slope for sediment transport calculations. The Contractor shall conduct stream gaging and turbidity monitoring as necessary to compute the sediment transport in locations were USGS data is not available. Streamflow gaging and turbidity monitoring conducted by the Contractor shall conform to applicable standards and protocols from USGS.
Task 3 Fluvial Geomorphic MonitoringThe following tasks are to be conducted on an as needed basis as directed by TRRP. Estimated annual requirements are given below. Final requirements (e.g. location, timing, frequency, and method of monitoring and analysis) shall be determined jointly by the Contractor and TRRP.
Task 3.1 River Topography and Bathymetry The Contractor shall conduct topographic/bathymetric surveys consisting of terrestrial ground elevations, bed elevation, and water depths in the river and floodplain. Points will be collected in a wide variety of geomorphic settings, including near-banks area, both terrestrial and in-river, areas under tree canopy, riffles, rapids, deep pools, and open flat areas. All surveying shall meet the following requirements: Horizontal Accuracy 0.3 meters, Vertical accuracy 0.046 meters, Survey Units US Survey Feet, Grid to Ground Conversion Factor 0.99982165 (combined Scale Factor when running conventional survey equipment). Survey points may be obtained by any means necessary, including rod-mounted GPS, total station, and sonar with integrated GPS. 
3.1.1 Cross Section SurveysApproximately 15 cross sections shall be surveyed per year. Cross section surveys shall be conducted and documented following methods described in Harrelson et al. (1994).

DOE-ORO is conducting a Source Evaluation Board (SEB) for major system acquisitions and competitions in support of all ORO Programs.  The SEB procurement process has already begun and has an extremely aggressive schedule.  Consultant services are required by February 25, 2010.  Due to the urgency and complexity of this procurement, it is necessary to obtain consultant services from a party with prior extensive knowledge of the Department of Energy procurement process, both from a Headquarters and field perspective.  The consultant must be in close proximity to the Oak Ridge area and available to provide assistance within 24-hour notice and within quarter-hour increments.  There is only one known source, Don R. Sloan, who has the knowledge and availability needed to provide these consultant services.  Don served as a DOE Headquarters Procurement Analyst overseeing many major source selections including the Idaho National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .  Mr. Sloan has served as the Chairman of several SEBs, including the SEB for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Mr. Sloan also developed standard Department training materials for SEBs and Source Selection Officials.  Mr. Sloan has worked in two DOE field procurement offices.  Mr. Sloan's availability and combined knowledge of DOE headquarters and field policies, and his experience with major SEBs makes him the only source available to provide consultant services to the DOE-ORO Procurement and Contracts Division.  
Individuals who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the ability to provide above.  All interested parties must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), February 23, 2010, to Judy Spillman, AD-424, U.S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Rd., Oak Ridge, TN 37830.

<DESC>TITLE:  RECOVERY The National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth (Data Coordinating Center)

This is a Research and Development (R&D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement. 

a.	Background: Normal fetal growth is a critical component to a healthy pregnancy and the long-term health of the child.  An objective assessment of normal and abnormal fetal growth has enormous utility in prenatal care, neonatal care and outcome-based research.  How to define fetal growth restriction is a long-standing challenge in modern obstetrics.  Small-for-gestational-age, defined as a birthweight or estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile at a given gestational week, is commonly used as a surrogate to fetal growth restriction.  The main problem with this definition is that babies with a weight less than 10th percentile are not necessarily growth restricted (e.g., constitutionally small but healthy babies).  On the other hand, a weight above the 10th percentile does not necessarily mean a normal fetal growth.  For example, the rate of fetal growth may undergo pathological decline in late gestation (say, from 75th percentile in early pregnancy to 25th percentile at birth).  In such a case, the birthweight is still above the 10th percentile but the fetus may have suffered from growth restriction indicated by higher perinatal mortality and morbidity

Twin pregnancies have become increasingly common since 1980, due to the use of assisted reproductive technologies.  Twin gestations have substantially higher risks of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.  In particular, relative to singletons, twins on average are born with a lower mean birthweight, shorter gestation, and a higher rate of fetal growth restriction, are four times more likely to develop cerebral palsy, and have a seven-fold increased risk of infant mortality.  Our understanding of twin fetal growth, however, is still limited, and only a few longitudinal studies of twin pregnancy have been conducted, most involving small sample sizes.

The key to solving these problems is to develop a method that can identify growth potential for individual fetuses.  The underlying concept proposed by Gardosi et al. was that fetuses who significantly deviate from their individual optimal fetal size at a given gestation are considered either overgrown or growth restricted.  Mounting evidence demonstrates that this method is a significant improvement over the 10th percentile in identifying and classifying fetal growth restriction.  However, no good standard currently exists for fetal anthropometric parameters measured longitudinally throughout pregnancy in a sufficiently large number of normal pregnancies in the U.S.  The NICHD proposes to conduct a multicenter prospective study to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth. The results from the study will for the first time establish a U.S. national standard and have profound impact on patient management and research for years to come.



b.	Purpose and Objective : The primary purposes of this study are: (1) to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age; (2) to create an individualized standard for optimal fetal growth; (3) to improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation; and (4) to construct an individualized standard for fundal height.  

This multicenter, prospective study, which officially commenced on September 26, 2008, is being conducted at four clinical sites in the U.S.  The study involves the recruitment and follow-up of (1) 2,400 low-risk, normal weight women with an equal number of White, Hispanic, African American and Asian race/ethnicity; (2) 600 obese women; and (3) 250 monochorionic and 250 dichorionic twin pregnancies.  Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive 5 scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimentinoal (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.  Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.  After delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures will be carefully taken.  Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.  Recruitment began on July 15, 2009 and is expected to last at least two calendar years.  

The objectives for this proposed acquisition are to enhance the current web-based data management system to ensure accurate and timely data collection from (1) potential new clinical sites; (2) the 250 monochorionic and 250 dichorionic twin pregnancies added to the study; and (3) the dietary questionnaires now being administered to all participants as part of the ongoing study.  Originally, recruitment was restricted to women with singleton pregnancies at four clinical sites, while the evaluation of nutritional factors was limited to only a quarter of the study subjects.


c.	Projected requirements:  
	Manage, coordinate and monitor potential additional clinical sites in the study;
	Expand the current web-based data management system to successfully support the potential addition of clinical sites to the study;
	Collect in a timely manner the additional data and images associated with both the twin component of the study and the questionnaire to all study participants on nutrient and supplement intake during pregnancy;
	Assist in continuous quality control procedures for the ultrasound measures.

d.	Anticipated period of performance: 24 month period

<DESC>TITLE:  RECOVERY The National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth 

This is a Research and Development (R&D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement. 

a.	Background: Normal fetal growth is a critical component to a healthy pregnancy and the long-term health of the child.  An objective assessment of normal and abnormal fetal growth has enormous utility in prenatal care, neonatal care and outcome-based research.  How to define fetal growth restriction is a long-standing challenge in modern obstetrics.  Small-for-gestational-age, defined as a birthweight or estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile at a given gestational week, is commonly used as a surrogate to fetal growth restriction.  The main problem with this definition is that babies with a weight less than 10th percentile are not necessarily growth restricted (e.g., constitutionally small but healthy babies).  On the other hand, a weight above the 10th percentile does not necessarily mean a normal fetal growth.  For example, the rate of fetal growth may undergo pathological decline in late gestation (say, from 75th percentile in early pregnancy to 25th percentile at birth).  In such a case, the birthweight is still above the 10th percentile but the fetus may have suffered from growth restriction indicated by higher perinatal mortality and morbidity

Twin pregnancies have become increasingly common since 1980, due to the use of assisted reproductive technologies.  Twin gestations have substantially higher risks of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.  In particular, relative to singletons, twins on average are born with a lower mean birthweight, shorter gestation, and a higher rate of fetal growth restriction, are four times more likely to develop cerebral palsy, and have a seven-fold increased risk of infant mortality.  Our understanding of twin fetal growth, however, is still limited, and only a few longitudinal studies of twin pregnancy have been conducted, most involving small sample sizes.

The key to solving these problems is to develop a method that can identify growth potential for individual fetuses.  The underlying concept proposed by Gardosi et al. was that fetuses who significantly deviate from their individual optimal fetal size at a given gestation are considered either overgrown or growth restricted.  Mounting evidence demonstrates that this method is a significant improvement over the 10th percentile in identifying and classifying fetal growth restriction.  However, no good standard currently exists for fetal anthropometric parameters measured longitudinally throughout pregnancy in a sufficiently large number of normal pregnancies in the U.S.  The NICHD proposes to conduct a multicenter prospective study to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth. The results from the study will for the first time establish a U.S. national standard and have profound impact on patient management and research for years to come.



b.	Purpose and Objective : The primary purposes of this study are: (1) to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age; (2) to create an individualized standard for optimal fetal growth; (3) to improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation; and (4) to construct an individualized standard for fundal height.  

This multicenter, prospective study, which officially commenced on September 26, 2008, is being conducted at four clinical sites in the U.S.  The study involves the recruitment and follow-up of (1) 2,400 low-risk, normal weight women with an equal number of White, Hispanic, African American and Asian race/ethnicity; (2) 600 obese women; and (3) 250 monochorionic and 250 dichorionic twin pregnancies.  Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive 5 scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimentinoal (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.  Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.  After delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures will be carefully taken.  Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.  Recruitment began on July 15, 2009 and is expected to last at least two calendar years.  

The objectives for this proposed acquisition are: (1) to add monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies to the study population; and (2) to enhance the investigation of nutritional factors on fetal growth by administering the dietary questionnaires to all participants.  Originally, recruitment was restricted to women with singleton pregnancies, while the evaluation of nutritional factors was limited to only a quarter of study subjects.

c.	Projected requirements:  
	Identify and recruit  monochronic and dichorionic twin pregnancies early in pregnancy and follow up throughout pregnancy with 7 follow-up visits and ultrasound exams until delivery;
	Collect information on nutrient and supplement intake during pregnancy in all subjects (normal women, obese women and twin pregnancies), which will improve assessment of the impact of imbalances in maternal diet on adverse pregnancy outcomes, e.g., fetal growth, birthweight, and preterm birth.

d.	Anticipated period of performance: 24 month period

e.	Capability Statement/Information Sought:

An experienced, qualified sonographer certified by the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography with specialty certification in Obstetrics shall be available at least half time for the study.  The Sonographer shall be familiar with GE E8 machine and ViewPoint software for image saving and transfer.

 Facilities:  It is desirable that the offeror have access to a twin clinic in order to be able to recruit a sufficient number of twin pregnancies.  The offeror shall have adequate research space and facility to conduct a prospective study, including office space for research staff and patient enrollment, lab facilities for blood and placental sample collection, processing and storage at -70 degree.  An ultrasound exam room shall be available for this study.  The offeror shall provide easy access to routine and emergency (24/7) obstetric care. 

 Other specific capability pertinent to the study include:  
1)	recruit, within 12 months, at least 30 monochorionic and 30 dichorionic twin pregnancies in the first trimester;
2)	randomize and interview subjects to collect detailed information on demographic characteristics, medical and reproductive history, health behavior, stress and physical activities;

<p>A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 awards (acquisition and assistance). The staff manages a program that addresses six program areas principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.</p>

<DESC>The scope of work for this construction contract  is as follows:<BR><BR>(1) Install two (2) pre-cast reinforced concrete manholes.  These manholes are for access to the existing 30 diameter by 2400 feet long relief well and toe drain corrugated metal collector pipe (CMP) at Cherry Creek Dam.  This pipe is situated 12 feet to 30 feet below grade on the downstream slope of the Cherry Creek Dam embankment.  The depths of the manholes are 15 feet and 30 feet.  Estimated earthwork quantities are 2500 cubic yards of excavation and backfill.  The installation of sheet piling will be necessary for temporary shoring during excavation.<BR><BR>(2) Remove all sediment and flush the inside of the 30 diameter relief well and toe drain CMP collector pipe.  The length of this pipe is 2400 feet and varies between 12 feet to 30 feet below grade.  Access to the pipe will be provided by the 2 newly installed manholes and 1 existing manhole.   It is estimated between 150 and 200 cubic yards of material will be removed from the pipe and disposed of offsite.  The Contractor can expect accumulated hard packed sediment in the pipe up to a thickness of one-third to one-half the depth of the pipe.  The pipe will need to be flushed clean with water, brushes, etc. to facilitate a thorough inspection.  Down-hole packers will need to be installed in 14 adjacent relief wells during flushing operations to prevent sediment from fouling these wells.<BR><BR>(3) Conduct a thorough downhole camera inspection and document the condition of the  30 diameter relief well and toe drain CMP collector pipe.  The length of this pipe is 2400 feet and is 12 feet to 30 feet below grade.  Access to the pipe will be provided by the 2 newly installed manholes and 1 existing manhole.  The camera equipment shall be a high resolution color camera and pose pan and tilt capability for inspection at right angles to the camera with 360 degree rotation. The entire circumference of each joint will be inspected and videotaped for  each outfall pipe from the relief wells and toe drain system (17 total) which penetrates the collector pipe. The Contractor shall provide a digital recording of the entire inspection and a written report along with digital photographs of significant defects of the pipe.<BR><BR>(4)  A gravel road will need to be constructed at the toe of the downstream slope of the embankment for access to the relief wells/ toe drain collector pipe system. This road will require a top width of 12 feet and be approximately 2000 feet long.  It will be constructed of earthfill with 6 gravel surfacing.  Estimated quantities are 1500 cubic yards of earthfill and 800 tons of gravel surfacing. Fill material will be imported from offsite for this project. Once the job is done, the road will remain in place for project use.<BR><BR>Questions concerning this Sources Sought should be made to Twila Hopkins at 402-995-2070 or email: twila.a.hopkins@usace.army.mil.  Telephone calls regarding Small Business matters should be made to Hubert J. Carter, Jr. at (402)995-2910.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is seeking qualified businesses interested in providing "call when needed" helicopter charter services in Kodiak Alaska.  The total requirement is estimated to be 20 hours between May 1 and December 31, 2010.

The Coast Guard anticipates a requirement for a Bell 206L (or similarly capable) helicopter to accommodate projected personnel loads, equipment, supplies and distances.  It is a requirement that the helicopter and pilot be based in Kodiak as time may not allow and no payment will be made for transit time to/from Kodiak before and after chartered flights.  Both the helicopter(s) and pilot(s) must be carded by the Office of Aviation Safety (OAS) and the U.S. Forest Service.

Exact location of flights have not been determined at this time, however multiple areas on Kodiak Island, Katmai National Park, Ugak Island, and East Chugach Island are planned.
Interested vendors who feel that they meet the above listed requirements for Kodiak based, OAS/USFS carded helicopter charter services should contact the Contracting Officer, in writing at the e-mail address shown in this notice.  All qualified parties will be given consideration.

<DESC>PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this special notice is to provide interested parties with some additional broad information regarding the scope and USG expectations in this effort. It is anticipated that the prospective bidders will use this information to generate questions and to fully understand the Governments requirements. The document is not intended to be a Request for Information (RFI) but is simply provided for the offerors to use as a tool to facilitate their bid and proposal process. <br />BACKGROUND<br />The FMU 152A/B Bomb Fuze and Accessories (USAF) is compliant with each of the requirements of the System Specification and is currently in full-rate production of 12,000 systems a year with a demonstrated surge capability in excess of 20,000 systems a year. In the near term, production implementation of an FMU 152B/B Bomb Fuze with a FZU 63/B Bomb Fuze Initiator is expected and will be the fully-compliant baseline for the follow-on production contract. From a design and manufacturing standpoint, the changes are minor and nomenclature changes were required only because a low airspeed capability was added and the GBU 15/AGM 130 mission capability was removed. The changes will be briefed in detail at the planned Industry Day and a draft System Specification will be provided. The Technical Data Package for this design will be made available "for information only".<br />SCOPE<br />The goal of this follow-on effort is to acquire systems that are fully compliant. This is a production effort and thus development is neither in the funding nor the schedule. Therefore, the following are some example scenarios envisioned:<br />Current design (fully qualified design and facilities)<br />Current design (requiring facility qualification/FAAT)<br />Alternate design (fully qualified design and facilities)<br />Alternate design (minor qualification/FAAT)<br />If alternate designs are considered, offerors must be aware that the available funding is for production with extremely limited funding for design qualification, or verifications and validations beyond the First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT). Although this effort does not preclude minor changes to meet the Performance Specification, clearly one must enter this effort with a previously- qualified, production- ready product.<br />

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to modify the existing sole source contract FA2550-08-C-8012, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Obscura, Mission Integration, &amp; Network Support</strong> (OMINS) with the contractor currently performing the effort (Lockheed Martin Integration Systems &amp; Solutions) to extend the period of performance. The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). </span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The extended period of performance is&nbsp;1&nbsp;April 2010 through 30 September 2010 to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

Opnet is the sole provider of maintenance services for Opnet software products in the United States.  There are no agents or dealers authorized to provide maintenance services for Opnet software.  Price is considered fair and reasonable because it is the published price for these services.  Additional Opnet support is being purchased on GSA Schedule.  The open market portion of this procurement is $27,900.00.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award
The U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Office (DOE-ORO) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Don R. Sloan, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13. 
DOE-ORO is conducting a Source Evaluation Board (SEB) for major system acquisitions and competitions in support of all ORO Programs.  The SEB procurement process has already begun and has an extremely aggressive schedule.  Consultant services are required by February 25, 2010.  Due to the urgency and complexity of this procurement, it is necessary to obtain consultant services from a party with prior extensive knowledge of the Department of Energy procurement process, both from a Headquarters and field perspective.  The consultant must be in close proximity to the Oak Ridge area and available to provide assistance within 24-hour notice and within quarter-hour increments.  There is only one known source, Don R. Sloan, who has the knowledge and availability needed to provide these consultant services.  Don served as a DOE Headquarters Procurement Analyst overseeing many major source selections including the Idaho National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .  Mr. Sloan has served as the Chairman of several SEBs, including the SEB for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Mr. Sloan also developed standard Department training materials for SEBs and Source Selection Officials.  Mr. Sloan has worked in two DOE field procurement offices.  Mr. Sloan's availability and combined knowledge of DOE headquarters and field policies, and his experience with major SEBs makes him the only source available to provide consultant services to the DOE-ORO Procurement and Contracts Division.  
Individuals who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the ability to provide above.  All interested parties must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), February 23, 2010, to Judy Spillman, AD-424, U.S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Rd., Oak Ridge, TN 37830.  Email:  spillmanjk@oro.doe.gov. No reimbursement for any costs associated with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL, in support of various Navy command training facilities, intends to issue a follow-on bridge contract to VSE Corporation on a sole source basis due to there being only one known responsible source able to meet the immediate requirement within an acceptable time frame until the full scope of the requirement can be solicited competitively.  This bridge contract will allow the Navy to meet its immediate requirement, previously performed under contract DAAB07-03-D-B012, for a two year period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2012.  Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, an award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay of work in fulfilling the agencys immediate requirements.  During the performance of this bridge contract, an acquisition strategy for the full scope (5 year) requirement will be developed and a competitive source selection made.  A Request for Proposals on the full scope requirement will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and is anticipated to be issued on or about 1 August 2010.

The bridge contract will provide facility engineering and technical support services for the planning, site preparation, fabrication, relocation, installation, upgrade, maintenance, testing and integrated logistics support of technical training equipment (TTE) and associated support equipment installed at designated Command Training Facilities.  Engineering and Technical services are in support of various simulator trainers for Naval shipboard systems, ancillary support systems and overseas contingency operations.  The systems/subsystems include Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) Systems, Weapon Systems, Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) Systems, and Combat Support/Interface Systems and their supporting equipment.  TTE includes, but is not limited to, the following: Combat Systems Trainers; PSG/DDG; 6SRIE Multi Training Systems and testing Labs; OJ-451 & OJ-535 consoles; AN/UYQ-70 display consoles; RD-358, AN/UYK 43, AN/UYK-44, AN/UYK-7, OL-224 and 2780 switchboards; High Speed Data Switch (HSDS); SSDS MK-1; SSDS MK-2; AN/SPS 48-E Radar system; AN/SQQ89; GEDMS; MK160 Gun system; MK-46 Optical Sight; Battle Force Tactical Training system trainer (BFTT); CIWS Phalanx Gun System; and Computer Complex-1 & Computer Complex-2 that provide inputs to various training platforms for trainer functionality.  

Performance will take place at multiple government commands in San Diego, Ca; Pearl Harbor, Hi; Norfolk, VA; SRF Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan, at the contractors facilities, and at other designated CONUS locations.

The proposed bridge contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  While interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement or submit a proposal, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be reviewed and considered by the Government.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the contract specialist, William Aman, at william.d.aman@navy.mil (407-380-4173) or the contracting officer, Rebeca Gonzalez, at rebeca.gonzalez@navy.mil (407-380-4524).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>(1) "Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item"--</p>
<p>(i) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is--</p>

<p>(ii) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40102), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.</p>

<p>(3) "Domestic end product" means--</p>
<p>(i) An unmanufactured end product that has been mined or produced in the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) An end product manufactured in the United States if-</p>

The cost of components includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic. A component is considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component is of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that--</p>
<p>(1) Sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; or</p>
<p>(2) It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act; or</p>
<p>(B) The end product is a COTS item.</p>
<p>(4) "End product" means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under this contract for public use.</p>

<p>(ii) An end product manufactured in a qualifying country if the cost of the following types of components exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components:</p>
<p>(A) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.</p>
<p>(B) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(C) Components of foreign origin of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(9) "South Caucasus/Central and South Asian (SC/CASA) state" means Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, or Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>(i) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an SC/CASA state; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in an SC/CASA state into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed.

Unless otherwise specified, this clause applies to all line items in the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of other end products in the Buy American Act--Balance of Payments Program Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying country end product or an SC/CASA state end product, the Contractor shall deliver a qualifying country end product or an SC/CASA state end product, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(d) The contract price does not include duty for end products or components for which the Contractor will claim duty-free entry.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>POC:   Ms. Hope McClain, Contract Specialist, 757-878-2993.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.3 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this requirement other than this announcement. <BR>  <BR>INTRODUCTION<BR><BR>The Future Advanced Rotorcraft Drive System (FARDS) program is focused upon developing critical performance and affordability enhancing drive system technologies for the U.S. Army's Current/Future Force fleet of rotorcraft. The drive systems of the U.S. Army's currently fielded rotorcraft are extremely heavy, consume a large portion of the vehicles empty weight, and thus negatively impact the payload and range characteristics of the vehicles. The rotor drive system is an assembly of very high precision mechanical components with demanding manufacturing and quality requirements. Current systems have high parts count, making the total production costs high. Once fielded, the drive systems have proven to be a major source of operating and support costs due to less than desired component durability, susceptibility to corrosion and high cost of overhaul. The noise emitted by large drive systems is extremely high and at a level damaging to the human ear. Noise at this level (+100Db) also distorts voice communication, and accelerates fatigue of the crew and passengers. The FARDS program will consist of design, fabrication, and demonstration testing of critical drive system technologies required to achieve the program goals. The FARDS program goals are a 55% increase in drive system transmitted horsepower-to-weight ratio, 18dB reduction in drive system generated noise, 35% reduction in drive system production cost, 35% reduction in drive system operating and support costs, and 90% automatic detection of critical mechanical component failures, all relative to year 2000 fielded systems.   <BR>	 <BR>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<BR><BR>The FARDS program shall consist of design, fabrication, and demonstration testing of critical drive system technologies required to achieve the program goals. The proposed drive system technologies shall have a design life greater than or equal to the proposed baseline aircraft.  The FARDS program goals are a 55% increase in drive system transmitted horsepower-to-weight ratio, 18dB reduction in drive system generated noise, 35% reduction in drive system production cost, 35% reduction in drive system operating and support costs, and the capability to automatically detect 90% of critical mechanical component failures. These goals are relative to year 2000 fielded systems. Design, fabrication and testing of the critical component technologies shall be conducted to demonstrate the specific weight, durability, noise, production cost, and O&S cost attributes of the components. Offerors shall also be required to develop a methodology for assessing and refining the accuracy of the analytical tools developed or utilized for the design, analysis, and manufacturing of the selected critical components.  The methodology shall be validated based upon the comparison of predicted performance and operating characteristics against those actually measured during testing. Demonstration testing shall be representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to validate the weight, fatigue, durability, and noise characteristics of the technologies.  <BR><BR>DELIVERABLE ITEMS:  The program will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan, (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (4) Final Report, (5) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis, (6) Test Plans (7) Test Reports (Note:  Each of these items shall be delivered in the Offerors format)<BR><BR>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Unclassified, subject to export controls. Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or Executive Order 12470.

Type of contractual instrument is a subject of negotiation.  Appropriate clauses, terms, and conditions will be incorporated upon award.  Because a TIA is a more flexible type of funding instrument, the draft TIA is provided in the supplemental package.  Inclusion of the draft TIA should not be interpreted as Government preference for that type funding instrument.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, only a portion of an offerors proposal (i.e. certain tasks vs total program), or none of the proposals received.  Multiple awards may be possible depending upon cost share; however, the funding available is expected to fund at least one full program.  Agreements with cost participation by the Recipient of up to 50% are anticipated for each award made because the technology has dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror conforming to the solicitation that will be most advantageous to the Government. Award will be made using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  Offerors are urged to ensure that their proposals are submitted on the most favorable terms to reflect their best possible potential. Proposals should not contain classified data.   The technical proposal will describe the capability of their organization and any anticipated subcontractors to perform the work in accordance with the Performance Work Statement.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   Factor 1- Technical Approach-   Subfactor I- Understanding of the Requirement- The Government will evaluate the offerors understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the PWS.  The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the PWS and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. Offerors are cautioned parrotingof the PWS with a statement of intent to perform does not reveal the offerors understanding of the problems or their capability for addressing it.  Subfactor II- Quality Control Plan- The Government will evaluate the offerors Quality Control Plan (QCP) on how it demonstrates how they intend to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies for the requirements of the PWS.  The Government shall incorporate the QCP in the contract that will result from this solicitation.  The QCP will no longer be considered proprietary and will be considered releasable under FOIA.  <BR><BR>Factor 1, Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale <BR><BR>. <BR><BR>ADJECTIVAL       	DEFINITION<BR>Acceptable	The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  The approach includes strengths which significantly outweigh the weaknesses.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is at least moderate, as the proposal solutions are feasible and practical.  These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. <BR><BR>Unacceptable	The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  This approach has numerous weaknesses which outweigh the strengths.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical.  The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirement.<BR><BR>Factor 2 Past Performance- The offeror will submit past performance of 3 current or previous contracts for relevancy (within the last 3 years) based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollars value, scope and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from the centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.  Profiles of contract efforts should include dates, location, types of contract, dollar values, descriptions of the work and references.  References information should include the name, address, fax number and telephone number of the Contracting Officer or contract administrator. Phone interviews with the references submitted for the past contract efforts on similar work will be used to confirm those efforts and determine whether they met or exceeded contractual requirements.  Reference should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractors to be used.  The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 1.  Offeror shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted directly to the Government. <BR><BR>Factor 2, Past Performance, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale <BR><BR>ADJECTIVAL	DESCRIPTION<BR> Low Risk	Little doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR> <BR>Moderate Risk	Some doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR> <BR>High Risk	Significant doubt exists, based on the Offerors performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<BR><BR>Unknown Risk	Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Factor 3 Small Business Participation Plan and Small Business Subcontracting Plan <BR><BR> (1)  SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN EVALUATION APPROACH.  All offerors (both large and small businesses) will be evaluated on the level of small business commitment demonstrated for the proposed acquisition in accordance with the below evaluation factors:<BR><BR>a. The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part 19, are specifically identified in proposals;<BR><BR>b. The extent of commitment to use such firms (enforceable commitments will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones);<BR><BR>		c. The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform;<BR><BR>		d. The realism of the proposal;<BR><BR>e. Past performance of the offeror in complying with the requirements of the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, and for all large business offerors, FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan;<BR><BR>f. The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition; and<BR><BR>g. The extent to which the offeror provides detailed explanations/documentation supporting the proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof.  The minimum subcontracting goals listed below for this procurement are a percentage of the total acquisition value.  <BR><BR>Small Business:  23%    <BR>Small Disadvantaged Business:  5 %<BR>Women-Owned Small Business: 5 %<BR>Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business:  3%   Veteran Owned Small Business:  4%  <BR>Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business:  3 % <BR>Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions:  2 %  <BR><BR>(NOTE:  Because SDB, WOSB, HBCU/MI, HUBZone, SDVOSB are sub-categories of small business, a firm can be counted in more than one category.  For example, if a participation plan reflects 5% of the contract value for a Women-Owned Small Business, the WOSB would also count towards the overall Small Business Goal).<BR><BR><BR>Total acquisition value equals the cumulative dollars obligated on the contract.  Progress will be assessed by the contracting officer at the end of the base period, each option period, and at completion of the contract.  <BR><BR>I.	SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN<BR><BR><BR> Each Large Business offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9.  Offerors shall adhere to the format   outlined in 52.219-9.  Goals shall include percentage and dollar goals to be subcontracted for overall small business and sub-categories of small business with a separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option (if any). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Plan.  The plan is evaluated as ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE during source selection evaluations.   The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is a mandatory requirement for award to large businesses and shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract.  <BR> <BR>Small Business Participation Plan  Evaluation Criteria <BR><BR>The merit of the Small Business Participation Plan with respect to the evaluation criteria listed in items a through g above will be assessed by the Government against the adjectival ratings listed below.  Note:  The level of risk is also included in this assessment.  <BR><BR>Outstanding:  The plan has exceptional merit and reflects an outstanding approach for attainment of all goals and objectives; includes numerous advantages and no disadvantages; very good probability of success with very low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.   	<BR><BR>Good:  The plan demonstrates a sound approach and is expected to meet all goals and objectives; offers advantages and few minor disadvantages; good probability of success with low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR><BR>Acceptable:  The plan demonstrates an acceptable approach and is expected to meet nearly all goals and objectives, advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages; moderate probability of success with overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.	<BR><BR>Unacceptable:  The plan demonstrates a very high risk approach that will very likely not be capable of meeting all goals and objectives; disadvantages far outweigh advantages; very high risk of unsuccessful performance.<BR><BR><BR> Subcontracting Plan  Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR><BR>ACCEPTABLE<BR><BR> The plan meets all FAR 19.704 statutory requirements.  Detail has been <BR>provided to support an acceptable approach for assisting, promoting and <BR>utilizing small businesses.  Has demonstrated ability to meet prior <BR>subcontracting goals.  One, but no more than two subcontracting goals is<BR>less than the minimum targets outlined in the final solicitation document or <BR>contract modification.  Some rework of document may be required to correct <BR>omissions and establish realistic, challenging and attainable goals.<BR><BR> UNACCEPTABLE<BR><BR> The plan fails to meet most of the FAR 19.704 statutory requirements.  No <BR>acceptable approach has been provided to assist, promote and utilize small <BR>businesses.  Prior subcontracting goals met most of the time.  Proposed <BR>subcontracting goals appear to reflect less than a good faith effort. <BR>Substantial rework of document is required to correct omissions and<BR>establish realistic, challenging and attainable goals.  Failure to receive a rating of<BR>no less that acceptable will jeopardize proposal from being considered for <BR>contract award, see FAR 19.702(a)(1).<BR> <BR>Factor 4  Price- Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness and to determine the best overall value to the Government.  The offeror shall also provide a detailed breakout of all labor categories and other costs that are associated with the work specified in the Performance Work Statement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>I.  SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certified Rigger support for the United States Army Parachute Teams (USAPT) Formation Skydiving Team (FST), Style/ Accuracy Team (S/A) and Tandem Team.  The FAA specifically states: The main parachute must be packed by a FAA certificate holding parachute rigger or by the person jumping it and is also required to be packed within 120 days of its use.  FAA certified riggers may also supervise others in the inspection and packing of parachutes.  Hence,   two uncertified packers supervised by one of our  FAA certified riggers will satisfy the need.<BR> <BR>The contractor, as directed by the Contract Officer or his/her representative, shall provide this support to the FST, S/A and Tandem Team as determined necessary by the US Army Parachute Team Commander or his designated representative.  Work will be performed at the USAPT leased facility, Laurinburg/Maxton Airport, Maxton, NC. <BR><BR>II. PURPOSE:  The purpose of this contract is to provide timely and cost effective certified rigger (parachute packing) support for the FST, S/A and Tandem Team in performing their mission for the Department of the Army, the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA), the United States Army Accession Command (USAAC), and as the United States of America Representatives in world competitions.  As world champion competitors, the FSTs and S/As mission is live and highly visible.  Parachute packing services are often needed within 24-hours or less and may be cancelled within the same time frame due to adverse weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances.  Therefore, the contractor must have considerable flexibility.  Specialized provisions apply in that the certified riggers/packers utilized by the contractor must be FAA certified.  The contractor and contractor personnel must be thoroughly familiar with, and adhere to, quality standards/guidelines set forth in the FAA as well as Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).<BR><BR>III. PERSONNEL:  The mission of the FST, S/A and Tandem Team mandates that the contractor have three (3) riggers/packers, with a FAA certified rigger supervisor.  One rigger may be used invariably as mandated by the schedule. These riggers/packers must have technical rigger knowledge/expertise in order to insure that parachutes are packed safely and in a timely manner to meet the requirements/demands of the Teams.  The work history of each contract employee shall contain experience directly related to the tasks and functions to be assigned.  The USAPT commander or his designated representative reserves the right, upon request to the Contractor, to determine if a given work history contains necessary and sufficiently detailed/related experience to reasonably insure the ability for effective and efficient performance.<BR><BR>IV. TASK REQUIREMENTS:  Riggers will pack state-of-the-art ram-air parachutes into free fall, style and accuracy and tandem team parachute container systems to be used as main parachutes and deployed by members of the United States Army Parachute Team.  Parachutes must be packed to open reliably with minimal heading changes on opening, and softly at speeds up to 125 miles per hour, so as to avoid injury from a hard opening.  The parachute equipment brands will be primarily Performance Design main parachutes which are to be packed into the Javelin and Vector container systems.  According to FAA requirements, packers must ensure that all collapsible pilot chutes are properly packed so as to avoid a pilot chute in tow.  The main parachute must be packed by, or packing must be supervised by, a FAA certificate- holding parachute rigger or by the person jumping it.  Also, the main parachute is required to be packed within 120 days of its use.     <BR><BR>

This is a modification to the original notice that was published on January 21, 2010, Solicitation number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-065-DLM. This is a revised solicitation with additional clarifying information.

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 (1/11/2010).

Period of performance:  The proposed performance for this service will consist of one (12) month basic contract period of twelve months and will include two (2) options to renew for a twelve month period.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M Per Annum. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Human Genome Research (NHGRI) Intramural Research Program, Office of the Clinical Director requires statistical and administrative support assistance.  The statistical expert should be a senior level expert in the development and execution of clinical research protocols. The Office of the Clinical Director also requires administrative support assistance for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and will provide written reports to the Director, NHGRI and to NHGRI, Institutional Review Board (IRB) as required by the DSMB charter. The Contractor must have extensive experience in statistical consultation and IRB/DSMB administration for NIH Institutes and other Biomedical entities.
 
Background Information:

The NHGRI Intramural Research Program, through the OCD, conducts natural history studies and therapeutic drug trials on rare diseases; statistical expertise is essential to determine the number of patients needed to discern a difference among groups and to choose an appropriate study design.

Scope of Project/Work:

The Office of the Clinical Director (OCD), NHGRI, seeks contract assistance for two areas crucial to the mission of the Institute. The first involves senior level statisticians to assist in the development and execution of clinical research protocols. Issues to be addressed include power analyses, sample size, group analyses, trends, and stopping rules, as well as more complex topics. The NHGRI Intramural Research Program, through the OCD, conducts natural history studies and therapeutic drug trials on rare diseases; statistical expertise is essential to determine the number of patients needed to discern a difference among groups and to choose an appropriate study design. This work is especially critical for trials involving investigational drugs (e.g., nitisinone for alkaptonuria and pirfenidone for pulmonary fibrosis in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome), since these require an Investigational New Drug exemption for which annual reports to the FDA are obligatory. The Investigational New Drug exemptions are held by a member of the NHGRI faculty. In addition, future clinical trials are planned for rare diseases such as Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy and Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease; these studies will require extensive statistical consultations. Some pre-clinical studies also require statistical expertise provided by this contract.

The second area of support required by the NHGRI OCD involves administrative assistance for the Institutes Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), which includes a Principal Investigator, Executive Secretary and Administrative Coordinator. This committee serves the NHGRI Institutional Review Board (IRB) by reviewing clinical protocols in which there is an intervention, especially if a placebo is involved. The DSMB advises on issues such as study design, power estimates, stopping rules, interim analyses, and adverse event reporting. Members of the DSMB also assess objectively the seriousness of unexpected adverse events. The DSMB provides statistical, clinical research, and medical expertise on an essentially volunteer basis, except for expenses. Contract support is needed for arranging meetings, recording minutes, and communicating with and reimbursing members of the DSMB. The contract agency also provides formal, written reports to the Director, NHGRI, and to the NHGRI IRB, as required by the DSMB charter. 

For statistical work, initial and follow-up meetings will be held at the NHGRI offices of the investigators seeking consultation. Much of the data analysis and planning, however, will be performed at the Contractors Offices.  For administrative support to the DSMB, the work will be performed at the Contractors, site except for the annual meeting of the DSMB, which is held on the NIH campus in Bethesda.

For statistical consulting, reports of sample size, power analysis, stopping rules, etc., are required to be delivered by the Contractor to the NHGRI physician or scientist seeking the consultation. For administrative assistance to the DSMB, the deliverables consist of the arranging of DSMB meetings and conference calls, and the preparation of minutes of the meetings, agendas, certificates of compliance with Conflict of Interest rules, and reports of deliberations. These must be certified by the Director of NHGRI and delivered to the NHGRI Institutional Review Board and the NHGRI Clinical Director, in a timely fashion as stipulated by the DSMB Manual of Operations.

<DESC> REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service seeks proposals from contractors qualified to complete restoration of native vegetation at a 166 acre floodplain easement at Minto-Brown Island Park located in Salem, Oregon. 

The floodplain easement is comprised of four parcels (fields).  The western parcel (Field 4) is separated from the two eastern parcels (Fields 1&3) by a large slough.  Fields 1, 3, and 4 were active cropland until the final harvest in the fall of 2009.  Field 2 is an old cherry orchard that has seen little or no maintenance for a number of years, but is not included in this scope of work.  Within the project, USDA has identified six native plant communities to be restored.  Each community requires a distinct set of treatments to complete the restoration.  These treatments are outlined in the bid schedule and are described in detail in the specifications.

Differing treatments including weed and non-native species control and removal, site preparation, orchard removal, mowing, planting, and seeding are to be administered to the four parcels that comprise the easement over a four-year period as shown in the accompanying USDA Bid Schedule, Construction Drawings, and Specifications. The Government intends to make award of a single firm, fixed-price contract without discussions.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(I)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT (II)	PAST PERFORMANCE (III)	PRICE  
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii),   the two non-price factors.  (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)  Offerors' proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.  
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii).  Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.    For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.    
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance.  A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement.   
Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/  .  All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. 
This announcement will close at 12:00 PM PST on March 8, 2010.  Contact Nancy Landeros who can be reached at 805-982-2189 or email nancy.landeros @navy.mil.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

<p><br />COCO Alert 08-33: Attachment 1 <br />Notice for Filing Agency Protests <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is VA118-10-RQ-0132 and is issued as a request for quote. Quotes are due to be in receipt by this office not later than 03/08/2010 at 3:00 PM EST. The intended source is SunGard Availability Services Limited Partnership (LP), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) Only One Responsible Source.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.Veterans Healthcare is specifically cited as an essential VA function. Therefore, the Office of Information & Technology Region 4 has in place 2 data centers in commercial facilities that ensure all essential VistA operations are always functioning. One of the data centers is housed at the SunGard facility in Philadelphia. The VA currently contracts for support services including 1675 square footage of secure, raised floor space, complex telecommunications data circuits, operational/managed technical support, power and heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) from SunGard. This action is in direct support of Federal continuity of operations (COOP) requirements that state every Federal agency is required to plan for continuous performance of essential functions and operations in the event of an emergency.

B.1	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
	Accelerating Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II) 
	See Section C for a complete description.


The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery and organization to measurably improve health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will focus on practice-based research to achieve the following 4 objectives:

	Implementation of a proof of concept, through which a previously untested innovation is tested on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified problem (OR: to determine whether it works to solve/address an identified problem);

	Implementation of an innovation or improvement approach*, to provide information for decision-makers about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation will actually work in a given setting;

	Spread, or the taking to scale, of one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements, including the active, wide dissemination of information about what works, accompanied by concrete guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability.  Increasing knowledge about strategies used to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is an important ACTION objective as well. 

	Sustainability, to increase knowledge about the factors that contribute to, or impede, the long term sustainability of innovation.  In particular, we will look to ACTION II to closely examine the experiences and outcomes of ACTION projects that were implemented 3 or more years ago, with a focus on measuring whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained and enhancing understanding of the factors that supported or impeded sustainability.


B.2	TASK ORDERS

	This is a task order requirement for Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II). Services will be acquired on an as-needed basis through issuance of task orders. The minimum total amount to be awarded over the three year base period is plus two (2) year Option Period will be $3,750,000.00. It is anticipated that the maximum total amount for the Base period will be $4,500,000.00 and 3,000,000.00 for the Option Periods. Typical task orders are expected to range between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00

SECTION C- DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

Background

AHRQs mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  Agency funding is growing for research that advances the implementation and dissemination of promising or proven innovations that address the most pressing concerns of those who deliver, manage, pay for, or receive health care services.  AHRQs role in supporting efforts to improve real-world practice and policy has expanded rapidly, in part as a result of the recent emergence of health care reform as one of the most pressing challenges the nation faces.

In 2004, Greenhalgh et al.  completed an extensive review of literature addressing the question how can we spread and sustain innovations in health service delivery and organization? These authors identified several knowledge gaps on which to focus further research, and suggested that the most serious gap must be addressed by answering the question: By what processes are particular innovations implemented and sustained (or not) in particular contexts and settings, and can these processes be enhanced? In 2006, AHRQ launched an initiative titled Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION) that attempted to address many aspects of the gap identified by Greenhalgh et al., and that is the precursor of the current procurement, ACTION II.

ACTION is a five-year task order contract model of practice-based implementation research that includes 15 Partnerships that work under task order contracts.  The Partnerships include a total of over 140 additional collaborating organizations. In total, ACTION Partnerships provide care to more than 100 million people nationwide that represent a broad geographic, demographic and payer mix.  The 15 Partnerships reach across all states and are composed of diverse organizations involved in health care, including: hospital systems; ambulatory care practices; long-term care systems (nursing homes, home health, assisted living); safety net systems; health plans; university schools of medicine, nursing, public health, health policy, and management; health services and outcomes research organizations; Veterans Integrated Delivery System Networks; health care quality assurance organizations, associations of healthcare providers; and consumer advocacy organizations.  Each Partnership contains operational systems that house large, robust, healthcare databases, clinical and research expertise, and the authority to implement health care innovations. A particular focus of ACTION task orders has been on increasing understanding not only of whether a particular innovation works, but on how and why it does or does not work. ACTION represents one of the Agencys most successful efforts to foster public-private collaboration and incorporate best practices into health care delivery, broadly defined (see Definitions below). The period of performance for the current ACTION initiative ends September 30, 2010. For more information about ACTION, including descriptions and funding levels for task orders funded to date, go to www.ahrq.gov/research/ACTION.htm.  

Since ACTION was launched in 2006, calls for additional practice-based research endeavors have increased, and the value of this type of research has been more widely recognized (Shortell et. al, JAMA 2007, Berwick JAMA 2008, Wachter ). Berwick highlighted the need for research methodologies that focus on the local details about how something works and about the what of contexts, rather than removing these details in theoretical pursuit of generalizable knowledge. Berwick noted that it is only by retaining and sharing information about both the mechanisms  and contexts (local conditions that could have influenced the outcomes of interest), that one develops an understanding of the factors that affect generalizability.   Shortell and his colleagues similarly identified the need for increased knowledge about how to put known improvements into routine practice as a key component for improving the quality of care.  Shortell et. al. noted that this integration of content and context seldom happens, and specifically called for the expansion of practice-based research networks such as AHRQs ACTION.   Furthermore, Harvards Steven Spear offered the following guidance and insights from his study of Toyota:  When experimenting with innovations, do not merely ask "what did we accomplish?'" but "what did we learn and how can we put that learning to good use?   Spear has noted that

Particular interest in research on delivery of care improvement (e.g. process redesign, organizational changes, or financial incentives) has increased since efforts to launch health care reform began in earnest in early 2009.  Nearly one quarter of the priority topics specified by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research (http://www.iom.edu/?ID=71025) as meriting more attention are classified in the IOMs broad health care delivery system (HCDS) research area.  This type of research is, of course, particularly well-suited to the interests and capabilities of past and future ACTION researchers.

The current procurement for ACTION II seeks to answer these calls. ACTION II is open to all offerors and will establish an entirely new set of task order contracts. For ACTION II, AHRQ anticipates making awards to between 12 and 15 ACTION II Partnerships that are expected to have many similar characteristics to ACTION Partnerships.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, similarities in task order characteristics are likely to apply as well. There is a high probability of steady or increasing funding for task orders from AHRQ portfolios. In addition, funding may be provided from external sponsors.  Organizations that have funded past task orders include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the DHHS Office of Minority Health/Office of the Secretary, the National Cancer Institute, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  For ACTION II, AHRQ is taking steps to better meet the needs of users, stakeholders and Agency and DHHS goals,  to improve work flow and productivity and to support enhanced communication and collaboration within and among the Partnerships.

Definitions and Frequently Asked Questions

For the purposes of this RFP, the following definitions, some of which have been adapted from Greenhalgh et al., apply: 

Innovation in health care delivery, organization, payment and practice (referred to hereafter as health care delivery): a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness, access to care or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Innovations can either be new to the field of health care delivery or new to a given organization or particular type of setting.

Implementation: active and planned efforts to mainstream an innovation within an organization

Dissemination: active and planned efforts to persuade target groups to adopt an innovation

Sustainability: making an innovation routine until it reaches obsolescence

AHRQ priority populations: children, the elderly, women, individuals affected by low income, who belong to racial/ethnic minorities, who live in rural areas, who are disabled or have special needs

AHRQ target audiences: clinical, health care provider, purchaser/business, policy, and consumer/patient decision-makers

Appendix 1 includes a series of frequently asked questions, based on prior RFPs for implementation research.
 
Objectives

The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery to measurably improve the effectiveness, safety, quality and efficiency of health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will support practice-based research focused on achieving one or more of the following four objectives:
 
	Test or expand investigation of innovations that are new to the health care field, (proofs of concept). Research focused on this objective involves: testing a previously untested innovation on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified health care problem; documenting whether and how well it did or did not work, and why; spreading knowledge generated by this research to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Implement, in additional settings, interventions or improvement approaches that have been demonstrated to have worked in a limited type or number of settings. Research aimed at achieving this objective would generate findings about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation actually works in various settings; and spreading findings to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Spread, or take to scale, one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements.  Activities to achieve this objective would include the active, wide dissemination of one or more innovations that have proven successful in improving health outcomes or on-the-ground care delivery and the provision of guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability of the innovation/s. Identifying and evaluating different strategies for promoting the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is another important component of this objective. Activities to increase spread can take many forms, and can be undertaken by and/or target any key stakeholder groups.   

	Support Sustainability. To achieve this objective, researchers shall: identify and study the factors that contribute to, or impede, the routinization of innovation by appropriate decision-makers and other audiences. In particular, AHRQ will look to ACTION II to closely examine past ACTION (and other) projects to assess whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained, and to learn more about their longer term experiences in trying to sustain their innovations.


ACTION II Characteristics

ACTION II will embody some similar and some new features when compared with ACTION. The principal features of ACTION II include: 

Task Order Master Contract Mechanism: Each ACTION II awardee shall hold a 3-year task order master contract with a 2-year option to extend the contract. Competitive (or justified sole-source) solicitations for task orders will be sent by email to these pre-competed prime contractors throughout each fiscal year.  Each prime contractor shall share these requests for task order (RFTO) with others in its Partnership and decide whether or not to submit one or more task order proposals in response to the RFTO. AHRQ will specify the number of awards anticipated in response to a single RFTO, and the range or ceiling on the cost estimate for each award. Generally, proposals must be submitted within four to eight weeks.  The proposals submitted in response to each RFTO will be reviewed on average within two to three weeks by a committee of approximately five expert reviewers selected among AHRQ staff, co-funders (where applicable), and external experts in the areas critical to the success of the task order. Revisions may be required of one or more top scoring proposals for each anticipated award. Awards will generally be made within two to three weeks of receipt of best and final proposals. 

Topics for Research:  ACTION II is intended to generate and spread knowledge about solutions to current problems in a timely way. ACTION II will thus focus on practical, applied topics of high interest to: the DHHS and AHRQs portfolios (see Appendix 2), the Partners own operational leaders and champions, others making critical decisions and managing change, and other users/stakeholders.  AHRQ intends to use various mechanisms (e.g., Requests for Information, email queries, input from the ACTION II Steering Committee, input from an AHRQ web call for ACTION II concepts) to solicit user input on task order topics and ensure they are feasible, of high priority and ready for implementation or dissemination.  

Broadly speaking, topics will likely include, but will not be limited to: patient safety, health information technology, the structure, organization and coordination of care; payment; quality of care; comparative effectiveness of systems design and change strategies; health care for priority populations; prevention and care management, long-term care, health literacy and emergency preparedness. No health care setting, type of provider, type of recipient, payer or health condition will be excluded from consideration with respect to research topics that may be undertaken under ACTION II, though individual RFTOs are likely to focus on particular types of settings, providers or patients. It is expected that there will be a wide array of topics with substantial diversity within a given topic area. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics that are unknown at the launch of ACTION II may emerge over time. As was noted earlier, task orders will have a particular focus on research designed to increase knowledge about contextual factors that may facilitate or impede implementation, spread and sustainability. 

Nature of the Research: Practice-based research on the development, testing, implementation, spread and sustainability of innovations can take many forms. Some task orders will support the development or preliminary testing (proof-of concept) of package deliverables (e.g., toolkits, curricula, workbooks, guides, models, practice strategies) that address a problem in a new or novel way.  Other task orders may call for the implementation of a proven innovation in sites similar to, and/or different from, those in which it was developed, with the goal of increasing knowledge about the process of implementing innovations and the contextual factors influencing implementation. Still other task orders may focus on the evaluation of different strategies for spreading a proven intervention widely, in order to identify those that are most effective in increasing the systematic and successful adoption and utilization of evidence-based practices. Finally, an additional set of task orders may focus on evaluating whether and to what degree innovations implemented under past ACTION contracts (or other AHRQ initiatives) were sustained, and increasing knowledge about the factors that support or impede sustainability.

Types of Innovations:   As previously defined, innovations are a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Examples of current health care delivery innovations include evidence-based improvement strategies or activities such as Lean, positive deviance, social network analysis, and the implementation of bundled interventions (e.g. Pronovosts Keystone ICU bundle to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections ), bundled payments (e.g. around the Patient Centered Medical Home ) or other innovative financial mechanisms . Future innovations will emerge over the course of the ACTION II period of performance.

ACTION II innovations may be local to national in scope. Some past innovations have spread internationally, although this will not be explicitly envisioned or intended in the development of ACTION II RFTOs. AHRQ will make efforts to select and emphasize project work that is broadly responsive to existing user and stakeholder needs and operational interests, and that has the potential for future dissemination to additional health care settings, providers. payors or recipients of care. While a minority of task orders are expected to focus on large (regional, national) implementation or dissemination projects, Partnerships that have the capacity to take innovations to scale, either on their own or in partnership with others, to spread an innovation will be of special interest to AHRQ. 

Deliverables:  AHRQ and others experience has shown that delivery of a product or package alone to an intended audience is generally insufficient to induce tangible change in care delivery. Those delivering and receiving care often need help in using a new product or approach, particularly if behavior change is required to improve care. ACTION II will thus seek to generate deliverables that maximize the likelihood that research findings and best practices can and will be appropriately utilized by the intended audience/s. Final deliverables may include, but would not be limited to:
	products (e.g. toolkits, workbooks or guides) that provide detailed, practical descriptions of an innovation, explanations of how it is supposed to work and advice for implementing it
	innovative educational or training materials, including curricula for educational/training sessions or workshops (these may be web based)
	provision of support and technical assistance in the adaptation and adoption of a package or process by various new users 
	research findings written for decision-makers
	peer-reviewed and trade journal manuscripts, or final reports suitable for web-posting, summarizing lessons learned

Every deliverable, regardless of its form or content, must be specifically developed for or adapted to the intended audience/s.

Task orders may require the provision of a series of interim deliverables to accelerate delivery of critical findings or better document implementation processes as they unfold. Interim deliverables might include the completion of an environmental scan, the convening of focus groups, technical expert panels or stakeholder meetings, and the development or testing of measures or data bases, interim reports, surveys, or case studies, to name just a few. 

Dissemination: Spreading knowledge generated under task orders is a key component of all four objectives for ACTION II. ACTION II Partnerships may opt to include that capability within their proposed Partnership (by including as members one or more organizations with expertise in dissemination/knowledge transfer), or to subcontract for that expertise on a case-by-case basis, as dictated by the needs or requirements of a specific RFTO. Such expertise should include editing and technical writing, at a minimum.  In addition, AHRQ technical assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing may also be provided (see Appendix 3).   

Rapid Cycle Research: Individual ACTION II task orders must be completed within as short a time frame as feasible. As a frame of reference, ACTION task orders have been completed within 20 months, on average, of the award date. AHRQ expects ACTION II task orders to meet this average timeline of performance.  Exceptions to accelerated task orders may include task orders that require an additional 7-9 months (on average, currently) to meet OMB clearance requirements, and/or task orders that are very large, multifaceted, and require longer periods of data collection.  In AHRQs experience, several factors help accelerate the turn-around time of task orders once awarded.  These factors include, but are not limited to: a focus on topics for which there is a clearly expressed need by a specific intended audience, that are of high current interest to the Partnerships themselves, and for which there is alignment of interest of all parties involved in making the innovation successful; active involvement of champions and operational leaders; and inclusion of individuals in the Partnership who are knowledgeable about, and can readily access and manipulate, needed health care delivery and organizational data.

Sequenced and Bundled Work:  AHRQ may, where appropriate, reduce the current focus on individual task orders and increase the emphasis on a series of task orders or bundled sets of task orders to permit pursuit of topics to their logical and practical ends and take applications to scale. Some of the work to be done under ACTION II will likely be sequenced, with the work of each new phase being dependent on the results of a previous phase. In other cases, a set (bundle) of task orders may be awarded in response to a single RFTO on a topic. It is to be expected that some mix of individual and bundled/serial task orders will be awarded in each year. 

Freedom to Partner with Diverse Organizations or Stakeholder Groups on an As Needed Basis.  Partnerships will be allowed to subcontract with other organizations, as necessary, to meet the needs of a given RFTO.  Partners shall have to decide at the outset which capacities they are likely to need on a continuing basis, and which they may prefer to seek and obtain on a case by case basis to enable them to compete for, and successfully complete, specific task orders throughout the contractual timeline. 

Opportunities for Broad-based Collaboration:  AHRQ expects to encourage more intersections among the ACTION II Partnerships. For example awardees of bundled task orders may wish, or be expected, to share lessons learned with each other as the task orders progress. Depending on the nature of specific task orders, ACTION II Partners many also be encouraged or required to interact with other AHRQ initiatives and programs such as the Health Care Innovations Exchange, the Primary-care Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs), or the HIV Research Network. More information on these and other programs is available at www.ahrq.gov.

Emphasis on Communication and Knowledge Capture: A number of mechanisms will be utilized to support and ensure regular communication between AHRQ and its ACTION II Partners, and among the ACTION II members-- both within and across Partnerships. These will include electronic transmission of progress reports, phone calls, virtual and face-to-face meetings, and the use of a new ACTION II portal. More specifically: 

	ACTION II task order contractors shall communicate with their task order officers on a regular basis (monthly/bimonthly/quarterly) by submitting progress reports and deliverables through AHRQs electronic reporting system. In addition, contractors and task order officers are expected to meet by phone or in person at regular, specified intervals. 

	ACTION II members shall communicate with each other, both within and across Partnerships, through an ACTION II web portal (see Appendix 3) that will be created for this purpose. Tools to support dialogue and collaboration will include web conferencing, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will also serve as an additional avenue for communication between task order officers or ACTION II staff, and contractors. For example, ACTION II staff might use it for teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

	ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository that will be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 

	Representatives of all ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in annual (or perhaps semi annual) face-to-face or virtual meetings. Other meeting participants may include ACTION II Staff, AHRQ Task Order Officers, the AHRQ Contracting Officer, experts in federal requirements, and experts in dissemination. ACTION II members will be expected to help AHRQ staff and ACTION II Steering Committee members shape the agenda for these meetings to assure their relevance to participants needs. Meeting topics may include sharing insights and lessons learned about ACTION II work, new opportunities for collaboration, or strategies developed to meet contractual requirements or overcome common obstacles. 

External Steering Committee: AHRQ expects to convene an External Steering Committee of leading operationally-based experts in healthcare delivery and other stakeholders and champions (including some already involved in advising AHRQ on related topics) to provide direction for ACTION II.  Guidance from the Steering Committee on how best to achieve program goals is intended to supplement that provided by AHRQ Center and Office Directors, portfolio leads and Task Order Officers, and will focus on identifying the most promising opportunities for the program and providing continuous input on strategic planning. The Steering Committee will also serve as an effector arm to help disseminate and promote uptake of ACTION II innovations.
 

Meeting Federal Requirements:  Task order contract research conducted under federal auspices, and products and deliverables generated by such research, must meet a number of requirements, including those associated with compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. As is further discussed below and in Appendix 3, AHRQ will help ACTION II Partners access technical assistance and other resources to support these efforts.

Support and Technical Assistance for ACTION II Partnerships: AHRQ seeks to help contractors more quickly and efficiently meet specific federal requirements for ACTION II task orders and deliverables (e.g. obtain OMB clearance, meet Section 508 compliance and other web-based product requirements) and enhance dissemination, communication and marketing efforts (see Appendix 3). To this end, AHRQ has arranged to provide support and technical assistance in the above-specified areas to Partnerships, as needed, on a case by case basis for awarded task orders. It is anticipated that some Partnerships already may have some or all required expertise within the project team they propose in response to an RFTO and may not require additional support or technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. Whether the expertise is subcontracted through AHRQ-organized experts or supplied by the team itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs. 

Eligibility Criteria

AHRQ encourages submission of proposals from Partnerships that will represent, in total, expertise that spans a broad array of organizations involved in health care delivery and recipients of care (including AHRQs priority populations). These include, but are not limited to health services research organizations; health care delivery systems and organizations (inpatient, ambulatory and long-term care); health plans; academic health centers, research consulting firms; Quality Improvement Organizations; Veterans Administration sites and other governmental organizations; employers or employer coalitions; state and local government health care agencies; community-based collaboratives to improve health care, consumer advocacy groups, and other organizations that work at the national, state or regional level to promote or leverage evidence-based innovation in health care delivery.  Given trends in recent funding and priority topics, AHRQ is particularly interested in Partnerships that center on, or include, substantial numbers of primary care providers interested in participating in ACTION II implementation research. It is important to note that the range of settings/providers included in any specific partnership will not be a scoring criteria; AHRQ hopes to achieve overall diversity across the network of partnerships selected for awards.   

There are no restrictions or requirements regarding the number or types of organizations that should be included in a Partnership, and there are many different models that Partnerships may consider in configuring themselves, including but not limited to the following examples:
	A Partnership may wish to focus on a particular type of provider/care setting/access organization. An example might be a Partnership of primary care practice-based research networks (PBRNS). Other examples might includes hospital systems, long-term care facilities, safety net delivery systems, or health plans that the Partnership would enlist to represent a diverse group of that type of organization; 
	A Partnership may wish to enlist participation from a broad group of stakeholders who span the full range of settings within which care is delivered to a specific priority population (e.g., children, the elderly, the underserved);
	A Partnership may wish to focus on achieving change through a particular type of innovation (e.g., payment) and enlist the participation of interested providers, health plans, and public and private payers 
	A Partnership may be a multi-stakeholder collaborative, composed of plans, providers, payer and consumers from a given geographic region
	A Partnership may be composed of safety net providers who serve multiple priority populations 

The Partnerships proposal must describe how specific characteristics of each participating member organization shall contribute to meeting ACTION IIs objectives.
 
NOTE: The lead, or prime, offeror in a Partnership submitting a proposal may be a not-for-profit or for-profit organization. While primes cannot be included in any other submission, non-prime collaborators may be included in more than one Partnership.  

ACTION II Performance Requirements

To successfully complete task orders that achieve the goals and objectives of the ACTION II program, ACTION II Partnerships must meet the following requirements: 

Requirement #1:  Understand and conform to the requirements of the Task Order Master Contract Mechanism. ACTION II Partnerships must be familiar with federal task order contract mechanisms and must be prepared to adhere to the requirements of the master contract signed by the lead Partner. While this point seems obvious, past experience has shown some misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of the signed task order contract by the lead contractor organization or the subcontractors on a given task order.  Task order contracts differ substantially from grants. For example: task orders must conform strictly to the scope of work for which the task order is awarded unless a modification is agreed to in advance by appropriate AHRQ staff; deliverables must be submitted on time and their quality must be approved by AHRQ staff;  deliverables must be approved by AHRQ staff prior to publication or presentation; invoices for hours worked during the invoice period must be submitted regularly and must include all required details; payment is conditional on submission of invoices and task order officer approval of the quality of the work performed; work conducted past the end date of the task order period of performance will not be reimbursed; and OMB clearance is required for collection of certain types and amounts of data. Partnerships that can demonstrate a track record of successful task order contract work, and/or have a clear understanding of, and willingness to conform to, contractual requirements will be preferred.  

Requirement # 2:  Understand and be committed to the benefits and purposes of practice-based implementation research generally, and of ACTION goals and objectives more specifically. ACTION II Partnerships must have a keen awareness of where their research might, and should, be applied in practice.  As has already been noted, but bears repeating, AHRQ is particularly interested in process: how implementation and dissemination of innovations works (or why it does not work). In cases where real-time learning is occurring, it will be important to capture sufficient information on the process itself to allow other health care delivery systems, organizations, and practitioners to adapt (or avoid) the innovation for their own use.  There must be sufficient scrutiny and documentation of processes to assure that others can gain from the experience of the task order team.

In preparing proposals in response to RFTOs, Partners should address questions such as:  
a.	Who are the end users who will apply the innovation in practice?
b.	What barriers or obstacles need to be addressed and overcome? What facilitators can be engaged? 
c.	Which implementation partners can help involve the most appropriate users? 
d.	Which dissemination partners can help reach additional appropriate users? 
e.	How can the research outcomes best be communicated to the intended audiences? 
f.	What is the best way to evaluate how the innovation works and if it will be sustainable? 

Requirement #3: Enlist the committed, continuing participation of organizations whose missions and capacities enable them to successfully complete task orders serving one or more of the four ACTION objectives for practice-based research (see Objectives).

AHRQ seeks involvement of: diverse providers and provider and system sites; providers of all levels of care that serve underserved populations; public and private payers interested in working with providers to achieve large scale and sustained innovation; organizations representing consumers/recipients of care; organizations with large data bases; researchers with clinical, organizational, measurement and other interests and expertise in health care delivery. Since the goal of ACTION II is to accelerate the development, implementation and sustainability of evidence-based innovations to improve health delivery, AHRQ has an obvious interest in including providers who have a track record of being innovators, early adopters, change agents or otherwise at the cutting edge of developing or implementing innovation. However, AHRQ believes that it is equally important that ACTION II include organizations that are broadly representative of the full spectrum of providers in terms of their past experience with implementing innovation or their capacity to do so.

Requirement #4:  Perform high quality, practice-based implementation research. Partnerships will be expected to demonstrate research capacity and experience with all facets of practice-based implementation research, as described above.  Such research shall of necessity center on a broad range of health care settings, providers, recipients of care, payers, and possibly on particular health conditions and will be expected to span diverse demographic, payer and geographic mixes. Multi-method research will often, if not always, be required. This will in turn require collaborations among well-recognized researchers, clinicians and others with expertise and experience in the full range of implementation research methods ( including both qualitative and quantitative methods); in manipulating large, robust databases (particularly electronic databases); in evidence-based management; and in a wide range of substantive clinical and organizational/management issue areas.  Finally, an ability to properly perform the desired research will require access to data bases whose size, scope and specificity are well-aligned with the research questions they are expected to help answer.

Requirement #5: Be prepared to enlist the participation of additional organizations in response to emergent needs and opportunities. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics and opportunities may emerge over time. Thus, Partnerships must be able to flexibly respond to new and unanticipated topics and opportunities. This flexibility is likely to result from a combination of the existing capacities of the Partnership and its member organizations, as well as from an ability to nimbly expand and change over time to accommodate new challenges and opportunities as they arise. As was noted earlier, AHRQ also expects to encourage more intersections with other initiatives and programs within or external to AHRQ.

Requirement #6: Perform research that supports AHRQs research priorities as reflected in its portfolios. Generally, funding for ACTION II task orders will come from one or more of AHRQs portfolios. The subjects of these task orders will thus reflect the research interests and objectives of the portfolios (see Appendix 2). The composition and capacities of ACTION II Partnerships should be shaped by a desire to serve these interests and objectives. 

Requirement #7:  Target priority populations. AHRQ seeks to include ACTION II Partnerships that serve large numbers of one or more priority populations (see Definitions). Because of the importance of this requirement, offerors are required to complete a matrix that provides information on the characteristics of the Partnerships recipients of care (Appendix 4.

Requirement #8: Engage and involve operational and quality improvement leaders.  AHRQ will expect to see evidence of strong commitment from operational and quality improvement leaders and champions of innovation, learning and change within ACTION IIs Partnerships.  Champions and leaders are expected to actively support healthcare delivery and organization improvement (e.g., making efforts to encourage the adoption of best practices, where promising, within and beyond their organizations). 

Requirement #9: Understand and meet the needs of AHRQ target audiences. Understanding and serving the needs of AHRQs multiple target audiences (see Definitions) is a central requirement of ACTION II. While no single Partnership is expected to represent or include every one of these audiences, AHRQ intends to ensure that all of these audiences will be well represented within the ACTION II network. Offerors will thus be asked to provide information on the basic characteristics of their Partnerships participants and any additional audiences the Partnership is in a position to reach and influence (Appendices 4 and 5). 

Requirement #10:  Identify and utilize communications and dissemination vehicles, methods and mechanisms that will maximize the likelihood of broad and meaningful translation of research into practice.  Dissemination of findings or products will be a key requirement of every ACTION II RFTO. Partnerships will have the option of demonstrating expertise and experience within their teams of what is variously referred to as knowledge transfer and exchange, knowledge communication, knowledge translation. Alternatively, Partnerships may wish to subcontract out the dissemination/knowledge translation functions on a case by case basis for individual task orders.  For some task order deliverables considered to be particularly important, additional assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing will be provided by AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (see Appendix 3).   

Requirement #11:  Manage complex research projects and coordinate widely varying activities across multiple, diverse sites and actors. Each Partnership will be required to designate a point person or small team located within the lead Partner organization to assume responsibility for: meeting ACTION II contract requirements (including the federal requirements described above); coordinating tasks and activities within the Partnership; assuring ongoing engagement of operational and quality improvement leadership; assuring quality control of task order deliverables; and maintaining effective communication with AHRQ staff throughout the period of performance of the ACTION II master contract. This point of contact or team will be expected to develop and maintain a solid working relationship with AHRQ staff affiliated with ACTION II (Task Order Officers, Contracting Officer, Program Officer, Support and Technical Assistance staff, if needed) and shall be responsible for maintaining current information on Partnership activities, participants and task order progress and deliverables on the ACTION II portal. Every technical proposal submitted in response to an RFTO must include information on who shall perform this role and how these needs shall be met; cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours and costs. 

Requirement #12: Comply with federal requirements. As noted above, completion of task orders shall generally require compliance with one or more federal laws or regulations, such as those associated with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. In addition, all deliverables must adhere to AHRQ publishing guidelines. As detailed in Requirement #11, an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization must ensure that all federal requirements are met and coordinate all activities associated with doing so.

Requirement #13:  Work on an accelerated basis. Partnerships must have the organizational expertise, experience and willingness to conduct and complete task orders within as short a time frame as feasible. As was noted above, on average task orders not requiring OMB clearance will have periods of performance of approximately 20 months (range: 18-30 months). 

Requirement #14:  Meet deadlines: ACTION II contractors shall assist AHRQ staff in their monitoring and tracking responsibilities by assuring the timely submission of high-quality deliverables. For each task order, progress reports and other deliverables must be submitted electronically at regular, specified intervals. 

Requirement #15:  Engage in knowledge sharing activities within and across Partnerships. Representatives from ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in an annual face-to-face invitational meeting and periodic phone conferences and webinars. In addition, Partnerships and their members will be expected to be active users of the ACTION web portal described above (see Appendix 3).  For example, the prime Partner will be expected to help supply data for the knowledge repository and to maintain up-to-date contact information and profiles of its member organizations. ACTION Partnerships will be encouraged to avail themselves of portal collaboration tools such as web conferences, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. 

In-Kind resources: A Partnerships commitment to a project increases when that project reflects the organizations own goals for, and investments in, quality improvement. While it is not a requirement, a willingness to commit in kind or other resources, if possible and appropriate for future task orders, is desirable. Most Partnerships will end up volunteering some staff time to ACTION II task orders. Such contributions are difficult to predict and quantify, and may depend on the type of organization involved.  However, AHRQ wants to both acknowledge such contributions and more accurately gauge the level and type of commitment provided by Partnerships. For these reasons, in kind resources should be accounted for by Partnerships in ACTION II proposals for specific future task orders, if and when they arise.

Guidelines/Instructions for Demonstrating Ability to Meet Performance Requirements 

The Agency seeks Partnerships that are capable of successfully completing task orders designed to achieve the ACTION II goals and objectives described above. Offerors should complete the Proposal Requirements Table in Appendix 6, which mirrors the Requirements in the section above and the guidelines/instructions provided below.  Completion of Appendix 6 will help ensure that all proposal requirements are addressed.  In addition this table will assist proposal reviewers with their reviews. 

To demonstrate necessary capacities and capabilities, prospective Partnerships must:

1.	Exhibit a clear understanding of the task order contracting mechanism and how it differs from the grant mechanism. Offerors should identify potential challenges and benefits to themselves and to AHRQ arising from use of this mechanism and describe how challenges may be managed or resolved. Offerors should provide evidence of past experience in working as contractors and, where possible, draw on this experience in identifying challenges and benefits of contractual relationships. 
2.	Demonstrate a clear understanding of, and commitment to, practice-based implementation research; provide evidence of a proven track record in this area.
3.	Describe the reason/s for including each of the proposed partnering organizations, highlighting their specific capacities and expected contributions. Where applicable, describe past experience in working with proposed partnering organizations.

(a)  Release and Use  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use  Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 months of the receipt of any proposed publication, presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:

(A) Identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) The confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	The quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

(2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1) (A) and (1) (B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b) (1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1) (C) above:

(A)  	the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1) (C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
 (B) 	The Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(3)	If the AHRQ COTR does not provide written conditions or approvals by the end of the six month period following submission of a request to publish a report or to make a presentation or other disclosure of material derived from work performed for AHRQ-funded research, the Contractor may publish, present, or otherwise disclose this material subject to the restrictions of Section 903(c).  However, the Contractor must print prominently on the report or any portion of it which is released, or state prior to any oral or other disclosure of the material derived from work performed under this contract, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW, SECTION 934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c).  NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED. 

(d)  Copyright  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of data, AHRQ, through its Contracting Officer, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c) (1) (i) to the Contractor to establish claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A description of this license will be incorporated into the copyright notices required above.

(e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Governments stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract.

H.2	 LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.  

H.3	SUBCONTRACTS

A copy of the signed subcontract shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.

	a.	The basis of indebtedness.

	b.	The amount due.

	c.	The fact that interest will be applied if payment is not received within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice.

You are hereby notified that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department.  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee is aware that he/she can be subjected to criminal penalties for violations of the Act.  Disposition instructions:  Records are to be destroyed after contract closeout is completed and final payment is made and in accordance with IRS regulations.

H.6  	SALARY RATE LIMITATION

Pursuant to the applicable Public Law cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.

For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.  Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts.  However, it does not apply to fees paid to consultants.  If this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

In addition, P.L. 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.   
	
H.8	PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

H.9	PROTEST

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a Task Order under this contract except on grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract.

H.10	SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

H.13	AHRQ APPLICATION AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted.

AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC).  This framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the following traditional project phases:

	Concept 
	Initiation
	Planning
	Requirements Analysis
	Design
	Development
	Testing
	Implementation / Deployment
	Operations and Maintenance
	Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  The IBM Rational Suite of tools has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects.   The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology.  The documentation deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by ARHQ.  The Rational ClearCase libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. 

Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractors SDLC must be capable of producing AHRQ required system deliverables containing the required content as described further in the following section.  It is required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain COTR approval before moving from one phase to another. The contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management (CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control process that requires  and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation. 

The following table describes the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

System Documentation 
The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project.  The documentation is to be delivered to the COTR for review and approval for each release.  This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agencys Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM Manager.  All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined artifacts for each production release of the system.  Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as guidance.  The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, Documentation Deliverables, are required by AHRQ. 
Project Initiation Document 

The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  The PID defines the business case for the project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document approved by the COTR and Stakeholders.  Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.  In the case of external development contracts, the PID is satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the vendor and accepted by AHRQ.  

 
Project Work Plan

The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables. This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design, System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which require COTR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.  

System Requirements Document

The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for design and development of the system.  The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:

	Requirement ID, Name and Title
	Requirement Description
	Software Release Version
	Use Case Model
	Use Case Specifications
	Supplementary Specifications

A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary Specifications.
Requirements Traceability Matrix

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them.  This matrix is created at the beginning of a projects lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing.  The project elements are traced as they relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements.  

The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the implementation.  

The following values are required for the traceability matrix:

	Requirement ID and Title;
	The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented;
	The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced;
	The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented;
	The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested; 
	The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.

The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a projects life cycle.

 

System Design Document
The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system.  

The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages.  For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into classes and class utilities.  Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should accompany the introduction.  Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document.

The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational CM Libraries. 

Test Plan
The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system.  The Test Plan is a high level description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following:
A.	Test Description 
	A general overview of the plan for testing the entire system. 
	Test objectives for all testing levels (e.g. module, unit). 
	Scope and guiding principles for the testing effort. 
	A policy for resolving conflicts that arise during the testing process.

Web Product and Web Site Development Guidelines 
 
The following list highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web tools or sites under contract that will be publicly available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources.  

Guidelines for Web-Based Products
 
Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products publicly available. All products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site should meet the following minimum requirements:
 



Titles of Products

Coordinate with your COTR on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than 10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word counteliminate initial articles such as The or A ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products.

Quality Control/Editorial Review

This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style.  This should be done by the AHRQ grantee or contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual which is available electronically at: 
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility

As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users.
 
Intellectual Property Rights

Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation of the following four questions:

	Who retains the copyright?
	Who has licenses for what purposes and uses?
	What are the constraints imposed?
	Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

Usability 

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are designed to facilitate. A set of Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines that should be consulted are available at: http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html

Beta testing prior to release is desirable, evaluating the product against usability heuristics. As feedback is received and products are updated, the revisions will need to be designated by version number and date of release.
 
Privacy Act Protections

Web resources are subject to the Privacy Act and this can impact both the development of Web-based tools and the users of those tools. Persistent cookies should not be programmed into the functionality of a Web-based tool, although session cookies are allowed. Registration for use cannot be requested if this would involve collection of individual identifiers from the users. Although exemptions to both rules can be sought, this involves a strong justification and several levels of review for approval through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
 
Guidelines for Web Sites
 
Web sites being supported through contracts are considered Federal information resources and as such are required to be in compliance with laws, policies, and directives that affect such resources. 

This includes content management and information categorization, including standard metadata, under the E-Gov Act requirements and Office of Management and Budget issuances to Federal agencies on IT resources. 

For recommendations and guidance on requirements and best practices, go to:  http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/best_practices.shtml

Clearance 

Web resources require clearance by HHS--including justification against a set of criteria. Publications cleared for printing are cleared for Web uploading at the same time. Web resources must comply with the numerous laws and directives that affect federally funded electronic information resources. Web content loaded on a site by contractors must be appropriate and follow all laws and directives. AHRQ Offices and Centers must coordinate initial review through AHRQ's Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) before launch, and OCKT will coordinate departmental clearance. 

Domain Names 

All domain names for any Web resource funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must be registered as .gov through HHS with the General Services Administration (GSA). Although other domains, such as .org, .net, .edu, .com may also be reserved by the Agency, the .gov domain must be registered and that domain name will need to be indexed by FirstGov, the GSA portal to government-funded resources. The FirstGov link is then required on the home page of the site. Coordinate with OCKT on domain name requests. 

Editorial Review

All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain." Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility 

Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services. Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such at HTML versions, but avoid uploading PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. OCKT has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at: http://www.section508.gov

Privacy

A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected.  Sites are periodically audited to ensure that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review--including the Office of General Counsel--and be published in the Federal Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong justification and review process. 

Web Site Mailbox

Every Web site must provide full contact information for the sponsor and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries. 

Records Management

All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to:
http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html

Information Collection Budget

If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection.  

 
Intellectual Property

Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue. 

Linking

External links constitute an implied endorsement and create a business advantage for the linked sites. OMB requires Agencies to do a risk assessment of external links, and potential links need to be assessed against the HHS and AHRQ linking policies and criteria. If a site deviates from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the Web site for full disclosure. Outside Web resources may link to Agency resources providing that the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency of a specific commercial product or service. 

Electronic FOIA

The Agency is required by law to have an electronic FOIA reading room and to provide materials that can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act in electronic form, if so requested. HHS requires that any Web resource funded by the Agency provide a link to the AHRQ Freedom of Information Act page on the main AHRQ Web site. 

Usability

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are supposed to facilitate. Go to http://www.usability.gov as a reference for best practices in initial development or redesign of Web resources. 

Web Sponsor Identity

AHRQ has uniform principles to identify AHRQ as the primary sponsor of AHRQ-related Web sites. These principles reflect HHS best practices for a consistent look and feel of Web resources, reinforce credibility, and support HHS and Agency branding efforts. The four specific principles that should be consistent across all AHRQ-funded Web sites are:
 
	Web site URL name: The name of a Web site should always contain AHRQ in the URL. A Web resource should either be a folder on the main AHRQ Web site (www.ahrq.gov/chiri) or a third-level domain of the Web site (www.webmm.ahrq.gov).
	Title of Web site project: AHRQ's name should be part of the formal title and appear at the beginning of the Web site's project name when referenced in print or promotional materials. For example: AHRQ's Web Morbidity and Mortality online journal.
	HHS and AHRQ logos: The HHS and AHRQ logos should be featured prominently on the Web site and in materials that are used to market that Web site. 
	Web site home page format: The Web site home page should have common design and navigation elements with the HHS Portal and the AHRQ Web site so that all Web sites look as though they belong to the Department and AHRQ Web family. All AHRQ domain sites must include a standard banner and footer that are branded for Web resources. Technical specifications and templates for developers to consult when designing Web resources are provided by the AHRQ Web Manager.

H. 14	TASK ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES

All work required under this contract will be authorized through the issuance of task orders (TOs) signed by the Contracting Officer and accepted by the Contractor.  TOs may be issued at any time within the contract period.    

TOs may often vary in terms of content, cost and duration.  Task orders will normally be cost-reimbursement type contracts.  Task Orders may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable, responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

Each Contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of one task order during the 3-year base contract. The minimum dollar amount guaranteed per Contractor is $25,000.  The purpose of this task order is to provide for general management and administrative work that is not directly attributable to a particular task order topic.  Services requested under this task order will be obtained on an as-needed basis through issuance of specific work assignments, as directed by the Task Order Officer (TOO).

1)	Travel to AHRQ or other locations for meetings concerning ACTION II as directed by the TOO. These funds are not to be used for meetings relating to a specific task order, but rather for the purpose of the overall initiative.
2)	Miscellaneous work associated with the general management and administration of this task order and other assignments as determined by the TOO.
It is expected that TOs will average between $250,000 and $750,000 and last between eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) months with an average being twelve months.  There may be circumstances where the amount and duration of task orders exceed these average amounts.  

Task Order Officer (TOO) will be designated for each TO issued under this contract.  The TOO will function as principle technical liaison between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor's Project Manager.

	Procedures for Issuance of TOs

	1.	Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each TO.  Factors such as past performance, quality of deliverables, cost control, price, cost, or other factors that the Contracting Officer believes are relevant to the placement of orders will be considered.

	2.	When a TO is to be awarded, the Government will solicit proposals from awardees based on those factors mentioned above.  The TO Statement of Work will be sent to those selected awardees and a cost proposal and a brief discussion of technical approach shall be submitted within twenty (20) calendar days.  In unusual circumstances, contractors may be requested to reply within a shorter amount of time.  Oral proposals and streamlined procedures may be used in selecting the TO awardee.

	3.	The determination of award of the TO will be based on cost, technical merit, and any other relevant factors.

4.	Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the Contracting Officer determines that:

		A.	The Agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

		B.	Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

		C.	The order should be issued on a sole-source in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order;

		D.	It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

		E.	When the dollar value of the order is less than $2500.

	5.	Each TO proposal will be subject to review and negotiation and will not be effective until signed by both parties.

		Required content of TO proposals will usually include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

		--offeror's understanding of TO objectives;

--proposed approach to solving the problem in terms of major steps or subtasks of the proposed study program;

		--types of final products anticipated;

--proposed staff by name and percentage of time each individual will be assigned to the work; and

		--management plan for conducting the TO.

	6.	The cost and fee for each TO will be negotiated based on the fixed maximum labor rates set forth in Section B - Supplies or Services and on other cost/fee issues.  

	7.	Upon negotiation and agreement on the proposal submitted, the Contracting Officer shall issue for the signature of the Contractor a formal TO.  The Contractor shall not proceed with performance until the Contracting Officer has signed the TO and provided written approval to proceed.

8.	The Contractor's performance of the TO is subject to the terms and conditions in the contract, and the TO may be modified by the Contracting Officer and ONLY the Contracting Officer.

	9.	Protests ARE NOT authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a TO except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.

	10.	The Contractor is not required to compete for a particular TO if it chooses not to do so, i.e., the Contractor may elect not to submit a proposal on a particular TO.  Such election will not preclude the Contractor from an opportunity to submit proposals on future TOs.

11.	Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily electronically through e-mail or internet but they can also be issued by facsimile or mail.  Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities.  When a RFTO is issued, the Contractor shall provide a proposal containing both technical and cost/price information for performing the required services.  Some RFTOs will contain quick turn-around due dates.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

K.7.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

(ii)	(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --

(e)	 Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
(1) 	Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) 	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) 	Contract award.
(1) 	The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) 	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) 	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) 	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) 	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) 	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) 	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) 	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) 	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) 	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) 	The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.

(iii) 	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) 	A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) 	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) 	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

	b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.

(1) Technical Proposal; (2) Past Performance Information; and (3) Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing;
			-to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
			-to respond to Congressional inquiries; and 
	             	-to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

		In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.

Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

	h.	The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  The four factors are: scientific technical merit, cost, past performance.  The scientific technical merit of the proposals will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor(s) for this acquisition.  Offerors that submit technically acceptable proposals will then be evaluated for past performance. Following these evaluations a competitive range will be determined.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all. 


THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION

The Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government.  The evaluation factors and assigned weights which will be used in the overall review of the offerors proposal are outlined below.  The technical proposal shall consist of the responses to evaluation criteria 1 through 3 (including subcriteria). The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The following criteria will be used to evaluate proposals and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  Factors facilitating the evaluation of each criteria below are referenced in the corresponding criteria found in Section L of this solicitation:


OFFERORS PLEASE NOTE: Evaluation Criteria 1 through 3, for  a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by a peer review technical committee that will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal. Program staff and contracting personnel will review and evaluate Criteria 4 for a total of 25 points. The total possible points for Evaluation Criteria 1 though 4 are 125 points.

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  SUBCONTRACT, as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBAs PRONET website.

These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal.

9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, HubZone small, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, HubZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned and women-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.

APPENDIX 1

Frequently Asked Questions

A. Questions on Composition of Partnerships

1) Please define an "offeror"?  Is the entire partnership considered to be an "offeror" or is only one of the partners an offeror and others are subcontractors/collaborators?

From AHRQs perspective, offeror refers primarily to the partnership as a whole. The participants in the partnership consist of the prime, or lead, organization with which AHRQ will contract, and its subcontractors/collaborators.
 
2) Can a subcontractors/collaborator organization participate on two separate proposals from two different offerors?

Yes, an organization can collaborate with more than one prime (i.e., the lead organization) in a partnership. 

3) Would it be permissible for ACTION II to fund partnerships that include organizations based outside the United States?

AHRQ's mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. In order to meet ACTION IIs objectives and to assist in meeting AHRQ's mission, this program is expected to attract and consider offers from US-based healthcare delivery systems that serve US populations and have access to US healthcare system data. 

B. Questions on Process

4) Will ACTION II contract awardees be awarded any funds immediately, or do partnership awardees constitute a "pool" from which AHRQ will develop and solicit proposals for contract task orders at future dates? 

Each prime awardee will receive an initial task order for $25,000 to help defray the cost of travel to occasional ACTION II meetings for partnership representatives, and other miscellaneous administrative tasks. Aside from this initial task order, AHRQ will indeed develop Requests for Task Order at future dates and solicit proposals from ACTION II partnerships. 

5)  Are partnerships to include ideas for task orders in their responses to the ACTION II RFP, or are they simply applying for a contract to become an ACTION contract awardee?  

Ideas for task orders are not requested and should not be included in the proposal.

6) Will the ACTION partnerships participate in the development of future potential tasks and requests for task order?

Yes, submission of 1-2 page concepts for Requests for Task Order is anticipated to be encouraged from all sources:  the ACTION partnerships, AHRQ staff, co-funding organizations, HHS, and others.  The Requests for Task Order themselves are generally developed by AHRQ staff.  Staff from co-funding organizations will also be involved in this process if co-funding is obtained. 

C. Questions on Past Performance

7) If past performance of the organizations involved is in terms of research grants (e.g. NIH RO1 type and foundations), rather than contracts, how will this record be evaluated? Are these organizations at a disadvantage if they do not have past contract experience?

Past performance evaluations on relevant contracts are preferred because they show the offerors performance on quality, cost control, timeliness and business relations.  If an offeror does not have relevant past performance evaluations on contracts, past performance evaluations on relevant grants will be considered.

8) Is past performance information required from all individual organizations within the partnership?

Past performance of the partnership as an entity is highly desirable. However, if the partnership is entirely new or includes new collaborators, past performance of individual collaborating organizations should be included. Please note that if an organization has a proposed subcontractor submitting a Past Performance evaluation form on this procurement, the name of the Prime Contractor should be included in order to be evaluated as part of the correct partnership.

9) If collaborators in a partnership have held federal contracts, and their performance on those contracts is relevant to the partnership's ability to demonstrate past performance quality, may these be included in the past performance evaluations?

Yes

10) It is the responsibility of the partnerships to ensure that their past performance evaluations are completed and forwarded on time directly to AHRQ by the contracting organizations listed in the Past Performance submission.  Can partnerships ask the contracting organizations to cc them on their responses to ensure that AHRQ has been sent the evaluations and that they should have been received on time?

Past performance evaluations are to be completed confidentially; offerors may not see the evaluations being submitted. Partnerships should emphasize to their evaluation contract organizations that evaluations must be received on time. Only those evaluations received by the date specified in the solicitation will be considered.  

11) How should relevant projects that have been funded internally by a health care provider as part of its operations or research and development be handled?  Should such projects be included in the organizational and corporate experience section of the technical proposal but not in the past performance section, since there are no external funders/clients to complete the past performance questionnaire and contractor performance form?

Yes, past performance evaluations should only be requested from external customers.
12) How many projects should be evaluated for the partnership as a whole? Does the number of evaluations vary with the size of the partnership?
Five relevant projects total should suffice unless the partnership is very large, in which case a few more examples could be added. 
D. Questions on Labor Categories and Rates

13) Although the RFP states that contractors shall be reimbursed for costs incurred for labor based on hourly rates, no rates are listed.  Is the offeror to provide the Proposed Labor Rates for each of the Years listed?

Yes, the offeror is to propose the Proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Ranges, for each of the Years listed for each of the six labor categories. The cost analysis will consist of establishing a Labor Category Hourly Rate Range for the six Labor Categories (I, II, III, IV, V and VI). 

14)  With regard to the presentation of labor rates by class level and year, would it be sufficient to provide a range, established on the basis of a sample of rates, within which we intend to stay?  Also, is there a specific inflation factor that should be used to show these labor rates in the out years or is the commonly used 3-4% acceptable?
 
A representative sample of positions that could be averaged to propose each Labor Category Hourly Rate Range per class is requested. The negotiations for the proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Range will include the evaluation of the reasonableness of the individual cost components (unburdened rate, indirect rates and fee/ profit, if applicable.)  The recommended labor escalation rate for future Government Fiscal Years should be approximately 3%. 

15) Is certified documentation of an indirect rate agreement approved for federal awards only necessary for the prime organization or for the other participants in the partnership as well?

It is required for the prime organization and each participant in the partnership as well If an indirect rate is not established by the time of contract award, the organization will be provided up to 90 days to establish the indirect cost rate.  

E. Questions on Participant Characteristics and Key Personnel

16) From the table in Appendix 4 it appears that some partner organizations should be providers/insurers.  In the section on partnership eligibility however, the list of organizations eligible to be included is much broader.  Please clarify.  Should Appendix 4 be completed for each partner organization or should it be a summary of all partner organizations including the offeror?

The table in Appendix 4 serves the purpose of very roughly summarizing for reviewers some characteristics of any participating organizations for which the named characteristics apply , particularly those serving patients, residents or health plan enrollees. Offerors are encouraged to present these characteristics either for the partnership as a whole or for individual participants in the partnership. AHRQs preference would be to report by organization, if feasible. Offerors are also encouraged to present, in similar table format, any desired complementary information (e.g., number of employers in a coalition and the employer characteristics.)   

17) Can the key personnel include people from each of the partner organizations?  Can major subcontractors be key personnel?  Should it be assumed that each partner organization has a key person tied to it?

Yes, key personnel may include persons from collaborating organizations as well as the prime organization. It is correct to assume that each collaborating organization should have a designated main contact. 

18) If the chart in Appendix 4 that documents delivery system settings and providers does not fit the offeror partnerships model of health care delivery. may an offeror redesign this table in order to document the types of services provided by its programs in the way which best reflects program reality? 

Feel free to add information in a separate table that may better reflect the components of the partnership in question. 

F. Questions on Small and Disadvantaged Businesses
19) Could AHRQ clarify the similarities and differences between a Small Business Subcontracting Plan and a Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan?   Could AHRQ clarify which of these two Plans should be addressed when an awardee responds to a task order?  
The requirement for the Small Business Subcontracting Plan and the Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be required only for task orders in excess of $500,000. The purpose of the Small Business Subcontracting Plan (FAR 19.704  )is to  provide information as to how an offeror plans to meet the DHHS/ AHRQ (departmental) goals for socioeconomic contracting for the instant procurement (particular task order in this case).   The Small Business Subcontract Plan will be negotiated on an as needed basis.   

The Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan (FAR 19.12) is a plan that provides information on how the organization as a whole has subcontracted with disadvantaged businesses in the past and how it plans to do so in the future.

20)  While the offeror realizes that no formal Subcontracting Plan or Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan is required with the initial proposal submission, and is only required at the Request for Task Order level, please clarify the SBA requirements that a prime contractor's small business percentages are derived from the total planned subcontract amount on Task Order proposals, not a percentage of the total Task Order value. 
 
The small business percentages would be derived from the total planned subcontract amount on the Task Order proposal.  Note the Task Order proposal amount may change as a result of negotiation. 

21) The RFP indicates that a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be requested if a future Task Order meets or exceeds the $500,000 threshold.  Could AHRQ clarify whether a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan should be included in the current proposal response to this RFP and if so, is this applicable both to the prime and to major subcontractors (if any of them are not small businesses)?  Is there any added value for including Small Disadvantaged Business Participation plan in the current proposal application?   

The proposal is not required to include either a Small Business Subcontracting Plan or a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan in order to be responsive to the RFP.  The submission of a Small Business Participation Plan with the proposal would add no value to the proposal. 

G. Question on Review Committee

22) Will there be any non-academically affiliated health care provider organizations represented on the ACTION II proposal review committee? 

AHRQs statute requires that all contract proposals are peer reviewed by reviewers who do not have a conflict of interest with any of the offerors participating organizations.  Reviewers names remain confidential and are not be released even through the Freedom of Information Act in order to ensure an impartial evaluation. AHRQ appreciates your suggestion.
 
H. Question on Proposal Delivery to AHRQ 

23) Please indicate whether other express mail services (such as UPS or Federal Express) may be used to deliver the proposal AHRQs Rockville, Maryland address and if there are security restrictions that would delay timely receipt of a proposal using express or other mail services.  

The offeror may use any express mail carrier it chooses. The offeror assumes responsibility for that choice (i.e., an error or delay encountered by the express carrier is the responsibility of the offeror).  Please be cautioned that security restrictions at AHRQ may delay timely receipt of a proposal.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure the proposal arrives on or before the deadline. Also be cautioned that a proposal missing any required components (e.g., insufficient number of copies) will not be accepted.






















APPENDIX 2

AHRQ PORTFOLIOS

The AHRQ portfolios are used to organize and prioritize research supported by the Agency. These portfolios have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and how the products and findings of the research are disseminated.  Each portfolio has a portfolio team and team lead.  AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge transfer (OCKT) has organized its communication and dissemination activities by assigning strategic planners to work with each portfolio team.  Where appropriate, AHRQ Task Order Officers will coordinate AHRQ portfolio teams and OCKT's strategic planners to disseminate and market ACTION II research products and findings resulting from ACTION II task orders. 

                                  Description of AHRQ Portfolios
Comparative Effectiveness
The mission of the comparative effectiveness portfolio is to provide health care decision makersincluding patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakerswith up-to-date, evidence-based information about their treatment options to make informed health care decisions. 
Health Information Technology
This portfolio aims to identify challenges to health information technology (IT) adoption and use, solutions and best practices for making health IT work, and tools that will help hospitals and clinicians successfully incorporate new health IT. Research supported by the portfolio aims to develop evidence and inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. Further portfolio goals include making the best evidence and consumer health information available electronically when and where it is needed, and developing secure and private electronic health records.
 Innovations/Emerging Issues
At this time, the Innovations and Emerging Issues Portfolio is being established and is expected to evolve in the coming months. The portfolio aims to identify and support research that has the potential to lead to significant advances in health care. Research and activities will reflect ideas substantially different from those already being pursued by AHRQ, and will constitute transformative research to solve pressing health care problems
Patient Safety
This portfolio aims to identify risks and hazards that lead to medical errors and find ways to prevent patient injury associated with delivery of health care. Important goals include: providing information on the scope and impact of medical errors, identifying the root causes of threats to patient safety, and examining effective ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors. Disseminating and translating research findings and methods to reduce errors are also important. Additionally, the portfolio aims to develop an environment or culture within health care settings that encourages health professionals to share and report information about medical errors and ways to prevent them.
Prevention and Care Management
The mission of the prevention and care management portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings. Portfolio goals include: 1) supporting clinical decision making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations, and 2) developing the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through health care redesign, clinical-community linkages, self management support, integration of health information technology, and care coordination.
Value
The goal of the value portfolio is to help assure that consumers and patients are served by health care organizations that reduce unnecessary costs (waste) while maintaining or improving quality. This is done by developing measures, data, evidence, tools, and strategies that health care organizations, systems, insurers, purchasers, and policymakers use to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining or improving quality. Strategies include process redesign, leadership and management strategies, organizational and community-wide quality improvement initiatives, legal and regulatory changes, consumer choice, public reporting, incentives, and payment changes. Also, the portfolio conducts and supports methodological work and modeling to improve data and research, and to facilitate its use for policy and management. 





















APPENDIX 3 

SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ACTION PARTNERSHIPS


NEED TO ADD SOMETHING HERE REFERRING TO THE ININTIAL TASK ORDER FOR +/- $25 K FOR TRAVEL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRIME COORDINATING FUNCTION.

ACTION II Portal

AHRQ will develop and maintain an ACTION II portal to enhance collaborative efforts for all ACTION partnerships. The portal will include tools to support dialogue and collaboration, such as web conferencing capability, provision of collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will serve as an avenue for communication between Task Order Officers or other ACTION II staff, and contractors. The portal may be used to host teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

ACTION II Partnerships will play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository to be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 
, for example: contact information for partnership members, profiles for each of these members, a library of ACTION II-related templates and examples of documents, relevant published literature, and a calendar of events of interest.  

AHRQ will provide technical staff to operate and maintain portal software applications. The portal will maximize security and data privacy. 

Technical Assistance

On a case by case basis, technical assistance will be available to ACTION II Partnerships for:
1.	OMB clearance package development 
2.	Adherence to 508 compliance and web product requirements for all electronic deliverables
3.	Dissemination, communication and marketing for selected deliverables intended for public release


1.	OMB Clearance Package Development  

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance is an outgrowth of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. It was designed to minimize the burden that data collection activities might have on the public and to ensure the quality and utility of the information collected. OMB clearance is used interchangeably with ICR Clearance (Information Collection Request Clearance) or PRA Clearance (Paperwork Reduction Act Clearance). 

OMB Clearance is needed for all federal contract research if any data collection activities involve ten or more respondents for whom the questions are standardized in nature. This includes any instances where an interview schedule composed of a set of core questions will be used for 10 or more subjects, even if it is modified for subgroups of nine or fewer interviewees (e.g. doctors vs. nurses, managers vs. front-line employees). These data collection activities include research project surveys, interviews, questionnaires, epidemiology studies, health risk factor assessments, and evaluations. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Clearance and OMB Clearance are two separate clearances. Having one of the two clearances does not negate the need for the other. 

The normal OMB Clearance process currently takes approximately 7-9 months from beginning to end.  More details about the timeline are available at http://www.os.dhhs.gov/ocio/policy/collection/infocollectiontimeline.html.  An OMB Clearance Package includes a number of documents and processes. These include:

a.  83-I: A Form that provides a listing of the information required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of which copies are submitted with each package to be reviewed by OMB.  
b.  Supporting Statement:  The supporting statement consists of two parts and follows a standard format.  Section A provides the justification for the proposed data collection activity and Section B outlines the statistical methods and design. The supporting statement is generally prepared by the group contracted to conduct the research on behalf of AHRQ.

c. Attachments: Any additional materials supporting the proposed data collection or instruments that will be used as part of the study are included as attachments, such as data collection instrument(s); a copy of the Federal Register Notice; a copy of instructions or letters sent to respondents describing the study; a copy of applicable sections of laws or regulations regarding the data collection (may not be applicable); and a list of consulted individuals (if a focus group or expert panel was consulted during the development of the data collection instrument). 

ACTION II Partnerships must comply with OMB Clearance for task orders whenever applicable (see Requirement #12 in SOW).  Thus, each ACTION II Partnership will be required to identify an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization to be responsible for ensuring that such federal requirements are met and coordinating all activities associated with doing so. 

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to obtain OMB Clearances and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request to subcontract for the expertise, using task order award funds, through a pre-arranged AHRQ contractor. Arrangements to work with the subcontractor to develop the OMB Clearance package shall be included in the technical proposal and the cost of the subcontract shall be included in the cost proposal for the task order in question. That is to say, whether the proposal team requests a subcontractor through AHRQ or supplies the expertise itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs.

2. Adherence to Section 508 Compliance and Web Product Requirements 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 
There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format - including text, audio or video - that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 
All contractors and subcontractors or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards as codified in 36 CFR Part 1194, and where applicable, those set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). Remediation of any materials that do not comply with all necessary accessibility standards shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.  Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to meet these federal requirements for electronic products and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request assistance from AHRQs Section 508 Technical Assistance Center (www.ahrw.gov/508tac/tacover.htm). The Centers web page includes a menu of services and the charges related to each requested service. Services include: conversion and remediation of developed, non-compliant products, training and education, and consulting and expert services.  If a Partnership plans to avail itself of specific Section 508 Technical Assistance Center services, the technical task order proposal shall include information on necessary tasks to be accomplished via a subcontract with Section 508 Technical Assistance Center staff; the cost of the required services shall be included in the cost proposal. 

In addition to assistance with adherence to Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act, the Center can assist with website usability of task order products, and other HHS and federal regulations regarding management, privacy and security of IT systems, and/or designing websites and creating website graphics. Technical assistance will be available for ACTION II contractors that need help to support evolving user needs for electronic products, or improved system administration, performance, search, navigation and usability for such products. In addition, technical assistance may include development of websites and other electronic products that are in full compliance with all relevant sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In addition to the Section 508 compliance Web resources provided above, information on accessibility can be found at:

4. Dissemination, Communication and Marketing

Simply providing information to potential users is insufficient to generate substantial rates of actual use of the information by specific target audiences. A key to successful implementation in health care delivery is to more closely link researchers, users and other decision makers to ensure both the usefulness of information generated and the actual use of that information in practice. The literature suggests that actual use of research increases when:
	The research findings meet the expressed needs of the target audience
	Short-term and long-term information-sharing relationships and networks are created between researchers and target audiences
	An integrated set of strategies and tactics, specifically designed to support practical use of research, is employed over a substantial period of time. 

For ACTION II project results considered by AHRQ to merit further investment in dissemination, communication and marketing, technical assistance from AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) may include, but is not limited to: 
	creation of varied and appropriate dissemination products and vehicles
	assistance in determining the most appropriate target audiences and the content needs of those audiences
	performing and promoting website marketing and dissemination; and/or convening technical expert panels and meetings
	identifying, conducting, preparing and delivering educational activities, teleconferences and webinars
	identifying opportunities for collaboration and sharing of ideas, approaches, best practices and lessons learned across AHRQ grantees, contractors and project initiatives, and coordinating and facilitating identified common activities and interests across these efforts where cost-effective
	providing assistance in use of health information exchanges, IT networks, connectivity, hardware, software, interoperability and standards
	designing and offering special, limited technical assistance engagements, to meet the needs of regional AHRQ partners, stakeholders and others in their project efforts.
	Reviewing awardee final reports and findings, providing summaries of key findings, lessons learned and best practices identified while providing technical assistance.
	devising adoption strategies that can be readily accepted and are likely to be sustained. Examples may include issue papers, briefs, implementation stories, podcasts, Webinars, etc. 

The value of task order deliverables for intended audiences it is not always known with certainty in advance. As such, this level of dissemination, communication and marketing activity is not necessarily expected to be included in a task order proposal.  However, if AHRQ deems that additional dissemination, communication and marketing for a specific deliverable is likely to have potential value, the Partners involved will be expected to work collaboratively with OCKT staff to  at a minimum - familiarize them with the features, benefits and limitations of the task order deliverables in question.

<CONTACT>James Tessitore Contracting Officer 7039643601     james.tessitore@aqd.nbc.gov;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (RFQ N10PS18095, Amendment 1) is the following:
1)  Extend the Intention to Quote date, from February 19, 2010 to February 26, 2010.
2)  Extend the Closing Due Date, from March 5, 2010, 2:00 PM Eastern Time to March 12, 2010, 2:00 PM Eastern Time.
3)  Statement of Work paragraph 2.4.1 # 4 (Page 40 of the RFQ) is revised to read as follows:     The Contractor shall contact insurance providers, insured nursery growers, leaders representing nursery growers and RMA's two nursery advisors to determine the satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the current nursery crop insurance program as well as how information on what the insured nursery growers liked/disliked about the nursery crop insurance program will be obtained and any changes the insured nursery growers have recommended.
The Questions and Answers are posted below:
1.	How many years of prior policy and/or coverage information is available, and how far into the future does the program administrator project the programs exposure levels?  This would include but not be limited to policies, premium volume, crop value insured, loss reserves for Nurseryman's coverage as part of the Crop year, rating plans, policy forms and reinsurance.
Answer:  Nursery Crop Provisions are available on RMA's website from 1996 through present.  There is no plan for the nursery program to discontinue. 
2.	What private sector insurers/reinsurers are competitors to this program?
Answer:  There is currently one other nursery insurance product available in the private sector of which we are aware.  The name of the insurance product is Live Asset Insurance (www.liveassetinsurance.com).
3.	Why have the number of AIPs declined from 18 and 15?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
4.	Please provide a historical list of AIPs and their market share of crop and nurseryman coverage, year by year.
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements. The contractor can determine how big the RMA nursery book of business is by going to the RMA website. 
5.	What role and how large a role does alien capacity play in the primary and excess direct and reinsurance market for wholesale nursery (insured) risk?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
6.	Are AIPs allowed to buy commercial reinsurance for some or all of the book?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
7.	Is participation in the program by AIPs voluntary, in whole or in part?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
8.	Who are the agent/producers the AIPs use to distribute and service the business?  Do any AIPs also do this as a direct writer?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
9.	Has the number of agents/producers changed and if so, how?  By number, by demographics or in other ways.
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
10.	Can the actuarial data be extracted for Nursery Crops results independent of the overall Crop Program results for:  primary, excess, catastrophe, insurer, reinsurer, agent, loss and reserves?
Answer:  As stated in section 4.2 of the Statement of Work RMA can provide data regarding the nursery crop insurance program.  The Contractor shall provide RMA detailed requests of RMA datasets and RMA will furnish them within 30 business days.  If the requested data sets require Contractor revision, RMA will cooperate with the Contractor to avoid excessive or unnecessary delays of any contract deliverable.
11.	When and who designed the claims management system?  Do AIPs view it as user friendly, fair and accurate?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
12.	Who is assigned the claims adjustment responsibility and how are they selected?  How long is their contract period and how is performance evaluated?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
13.	Please provide the list of TPAs per year and the reason for any changes.
Answer: We are assuming TPAs stands for Third Party Agreements.  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
14.	What are the payment and reserving authority levels of the TPA(s), and who makes the determination of ultimate payment of claims and loss reserving for example the:  TPA, RMA, FCIC or another party.
Answer:  We are assuming TPAs stands for Third Party Agreements.  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
15.	Are there any existing sessions for the AIPs or insureds to get together to discuss the program?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.  
16.	Has a survey been done in the past and if so, focused on what specific points and what resulting changes?
Answer: No surveys have been completed by RMA for the nursery program.
17.	Would the government consider privatizing this coverage?
Answer:  The government has no plans to privatize at this time, if the program is offered through private sources for essentially the same coverage, the program could be discontinued.
18.	Do you have a list of all US wholesale nurseries which meet your definition?
Answer: No.
19.	Which AIPs write Nurseryman's coverages as part of the FCIC policy offering?
Answer:  This can be provided after the award at the request of the contractor.
20.	Can you make available the list of agents who distribute for the AIPs?
Answer:  No.
21.	Who sets the agent selection policy for the AIPs?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
22.	Who is the contractor or contractors assigned the responsibility for stewarding the EPLPPS?  How are they selected?
Answer:  DataScape, LLC is responsible for maintaining and updating the EPL/PPS.  DataScape is selected through a contract award process.
23.	Does the RMA know their costs to administer the National Nurseryman's program separate from loss payment/reserve costs?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
24.	How are loss adjusters qualified?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
25.	What drives the current over-reporting of inventory values?
Answer:  Below are a couple of the reasons why inventory values are over-reported:1)	Nursery inventory fluctuates on a daily basis.  Therefore, pinpointing the inventory value on any given day is difficult to do.2)	Insureds may know the highest inventory value they will have during the crop year is $1,000,000.  Therefore, they report $1,000,000 on their Plant Inventory Value Report even if they do not have that much inventory value in their nursery at the time they report.  
26.	Why is the entire Crop program not under review?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements. RMA is contracting at this time for an evaluation and recommendations on the nursery program.  
27.	How are exposures in the program collected and to what level of exposure granularity is the historical actuarial information captured?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
28.	How many prior underwriting (or crop) years of historical actuarial information are available, and how far into the future does the RMA or FCIC project this information? 
Answer:  Actuarial information is available on RMA's website from 1989 to present. 
RMA does not project this information. 
29.	What actuarial data is available other than that which is shown at the rma.usda.gov website?  In particular, the Actuarial Section of the RMA website does not appear to capture loss and expense data, but rather current pricing and rates and the Data section only appears to capture indemnity (paid?).
Answer: As stated in section 4.2 of the Statement of Work RMA can provide data regarding the nursery crop insurance program. The Contractor shall provide RMA detailed requests of RMA datasets and RMA will furnish them within 30 business days.  If the requested data sets require Contractor revision, RMA will cooperate with the Contractor to avoid excessive or unnecessary delays of any contract deliverable.
30.	What is the penalty imposed or recourse taken by the RMA or FCIC in the event that an AIP accepts a risk outside of the approved program Underwriting Guidelines?
Answer: This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
31.	Premiums appear to be partially paid by the insured and partially paid by the Government (except in the case of catastrophic coverage, which is completely paid by the Government).  Does the actuarial data include the full (i.e. 100%) value of the historical premiums paid (regardless of subsidized and non-subsidized split)?  Who determines the subsidization percentage and what has it been over the historical exposure period?  Is the full premium paid to the AIPs or is the subsidized portion of the premium retained by FCIC?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
32.	Do the AIPs have to report their results for this particular sub-segment of their writings to the RMA and/or FCIC and is that historical data available?
Answer:  This question does not pertain to the subject requirements.
33.	Have 3rd party actuarial firms been engaged by the RMA and/or FCIC in the past to provide pricing and ratemaking advice and guidance?  If so, are those firms prior bids, reports and analyses available?  
Answer:  For nursery program, no 3rd party has been contracted with to provide pricing or ratemaking advice, however NCIS provided a recommendation regarding proposed changes from the 1999 policy to the 2006 policy. This evaluation is only for the current program, which began in 2006. 34.	Are statistics available showing historical indemnity (and expense) vs. liability?
Answer:  Historical indemnity versus liability for nursery and all other crops can be found on RMA's website at http://www.rma.usda.gov/data/sob.html
35.	When does the government anticipate that the recommendations of this study will be implemented?
Answer:  Crop Year 2014, which begins on June 1, 2013.
36.	The SOW requires review of 5 policyholder files from various AIPs.  Is that 5 in total or 5 from each AIP?  If the latter, how many AIPs offer nursery coverage?
Answer:  It is five total. The contractor will contact the COTR when they are ready to begin reviewing the policyholder files, who will then request them from the AIPs.
37.	Does the contractor review the files at AIP offices or will the AIPs provide copies of the requested files?
Answer:  The contractor will review the files at their own offices, but once they have completed the review they are to return the policyholder files back to the COTR.

OFFERORS MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AMENDMENT IN THEIR QUOTATION.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) requests information to develop practical and sustainable models for meeting the primary objectives of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) in an information environment dominated by digital technologies. This work should explore what is possible within the current legislative framework for the FDLP as well as suggest specific changes to the law where the existing language is found to be inhibiting the practical exercise of the FDLP's purpose and goals.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The desire for an informed and impartial consultant to perform this study has broad support across the depository library community and reflects the goals of a recommendation made by the Depository Library Council after its Spring 2009 meeting. The development of practical and sustainable models for the FDLP in the digital era is a necessary next step in building further consensus among all stakeholders and ensuring the public has systematic and secure access to Federal Government information in the 21st century and beyond.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<span style="COLOR: black">Information received by GPO on this effort will be used to help determine the future state of the FDLP and may be used to plan for and/or seek legislative or administrative changes to the Program. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) is continuing the strategic planning process for the future of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Identified goals are to determine a sustainable model or models for delivering FDLP collections and services to the American public in the online Federal Government information environment.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</span></span></strong>The use of digital information technologies by FDLP libraries; the general public; and Federal agencies, to publish and provide citizen-centric, dynamic, and participatory e-government services, presents opportunities for unprecedented access to Government information. Fundamental aspects of ensuring that the American public has current and future access to Federal information, however, are hindered by the existing structure of the FDLP, based primarily on a 19th century model of print production and distribution. To be relevant in the electronic era, the FDLP must develop other working models to fulfill its programmatic mission and outline the roles that each of the depository partners play in making Government information widely and publicly accessible.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;GPO and various library communities have devoted considerable attention to the study and discussion of these important issues since the early 1990s. From GPO's 1996 Report to Congress to the recently published Ithaka Report, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Documents for a Digital Democracy</em>: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">A Model for the Federal Depository Library Program in the 21st Century</em>, substantial work has been done by a variety of stakeholders to address many key issues surrounding public access to Government information in the digital age. There is broad consensus in the depository library community on the values and principles of the FDLP.</p>
<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">About the Federal Depository Library Program</span><span style="COLOR: black">:</span></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For more than 140 years, the GPO has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government's information, this Program involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Libraries designated as Federal depositories maintain these information products as part of their existing collections and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided through the FDLP.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">vision</strong> of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide Government information when and where it is needed in order to create an informed citizenry and an improved quality of life.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">mission</strong> of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide for no-fee ready and permanent public access to Federal Government information, now and for future generations.</p>

<DESC>Please see the attached notice Sources Sought <br /><br />The following questions were received from industry regarding the OCC's&nbsp; needs.&nbsp; The answers are below:<br /><br />
<p>1) Does the OCC have a central payroll system? If not, with how many payroll centers will the TPA be required to interface? <br /><br />The OCC has one payroll provider and that is the National Finance Center located in New Orleans, LA.</p>
<p>2) Annually, what is the total number of payroll deduction data files that the OCC will exchange with the TPA? <br /><br />OCC employees are paid on a biweekly basis and the TPA would receive a payroll deduction data file each pay period. Therefore, it is anticipated that annually there would be 26 payroll deduction data files with Health Care and Dependent Care deduction transactions, however for the Parking FSA only 24 of those files will contain parking payroll deduction data (parking deductions are taken twice a month).</p>
<p>3) What are your expectations of the TPA with regard to enrollment meetings (if any) and the production and distribution of enrollment materials? <br /><br />At this time, the OCC is not firm as to its requirements regarding enrollment meetings. The FSA program is not new for the OCC; however, a change in TPA would be and may require some communications meetings in various formats, i.e., webinars, face-to-face, etc. Typically the OCC requires at least one annual face-to-face meeting and another meeting during open season at its headquarters location in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>4) Who is the incumbent FSA administrator? If at liberty to disclose, what is the current fee structure? <br /><br />The incumbent is Wageworks.&nbsp; We are not at liberty to currently disclose the fee structure.</p>
<p>5) How many participants do you have in the Medical FSA? Dependent Care FSA? Transportation FSA? <br /><br />Current participants in Health Care 1,759; Dependent Care participants 50; participants in both Health Care and Dependent Care 171; and Parking FSA participants 260.</p>

Due date for receipt of proposal will be indicated in the solicitation document when it is released. Once the solicitation is posted on FBO, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates or amendments. It should be noted that paper copies of documents will not be provided. Offerors must be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) or may be not be considered for award.

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>a. Past Performance. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offeror's past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations.</p>
<p>b. Price</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-2379<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis<br /><br />RECOVERY - Proposals from all business concerns will be accepted for the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Design-Build (D-B) Project PRA-DEWA 14(13), Solicitation Number DTFH71-10-R-00008, located in Dingman Township in Pike County, Pennsylvania. This D-B project includes the design and reconstruction of the Raymondskill Creek Bridge on U.S. Route 209 at milepost 18; it consists of replacing the existing superstructure with a 4-inch Latex Modified Concrete (LMC) overlay, new approach slabs, abutment seats, and suitable wingwall and abutment repairs. Miscellaneous work will include placing engineered riprap at the north and south abutments to counteract scour, removing debris from the channel, removing vegetation growth throughout the structure, replacing the existing guardrail, structural transitions, and terminal sections, and minimal approach work. The proposed project limits are within existing National Park Service (NPS) right-of-way.</p>
<p>The substructure will not be replaced and additional investigation is required to determine if the abutments and foundations require strengthening through the use of tiebacks and/or underpinning. The bridge was constructed in 1955 and consists of non-reinforced concrete abutments and wingwalls supporting fourteen 36-inch x 27-inch pre-stressed concrete adjacent box beams overlaid with a 8-inch bituminous paving. The bridge spans about 52 feet and provides a clear deck width of 40.5 feet. The bridge shoulders are lined with concrete curbs and galvanized steel structure-mounted guiderail. No as-builts are available. The roadway approaches are on a horizontally curved alignment and the bridge superstructure is superelevated to accommodate the curvature.</p>
<p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance Categorical Exclusion (CE) has been completed by the FHWA. Only proposals that comply with the requirements outlined in the CE will be accepted; proposals that include the replacement of the entire structure will be rejected. The requirements of this D-B project will include the application and acquisition of all environmental permits required for construction.<br /><br />The design and construction cost for this D-B project is expected to fall within the price range of $1,000,000 to $3,000,000. The project at this time is "Subject to Availability of Funding". This project will be partially funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 104-106 (41 U.S.C. 253m), the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration is conducting a "two phased" D-B selection process for the National Park Service. Solicitation documents for Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), should be issued on or about February 25, 2010. Qualifications due date and location will be specified on the SF 1442 to the EFLHD office in Sterling, Virginia.</p>
<p>A selection committee will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select two or more of the most highly qualified D-B firms/teams based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process. During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements.</p>
<p>Use Internet address: https://www.fbo.gov/ (at QUICK SEARCH, type "EFLHD" and all available projects will be listed) to check for availability of bid documents. All bid documents can be directly downloaded from this website. Documents will no longer be mailed.

<p>04/17/09 - SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICEHAZARD RANKING SYSTEM AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST TECHNICAL SUPPORT This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR ? 121.104) possess the capability to support EPA?s Hazardous Ranking System (HRS) and National Priorities List (NPL) requirement. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government?s evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.). DESCRIPTION The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns for EPA?s Hazard Ranking System and National Priorities List Technical Support. EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able provide the technical and analytical services to provide support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA?s) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI) in assessing and implementing National Priorities List (NPL) activities. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), enacted on December 11, 1980, as amended, established broad authority for the Government to respond to problems posed by releases or threats of release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Responsibilities under CERCLA include: Section 104, Response Authorities; and Section 105, National Contingency Plan. CERCLA required the Federal Government to establish criteria for setting priorities among releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. EPA responded by developing the Hazard Ranking System (HRS), a scoring system which serves as the primary decision tool for determining which sites are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). The HRS evaluates four pathways of exposure: groundwater, surface water, soil exposure, and air. For each pathway, the HRS evaluates: (1) the likelihood of release to the media, (2) characteristics of waste (toxicity, quantity, etc.), and (3) targets (actual or potentially exposed receptors). Sites that score 28.5 or greater are eligible for placement on the NPL. The NPL is EPA?s list of priority hazardous waste sites. Sites on the NPL are eligible for Federal funding to perform remedial actions. For the purposes of this sources sought, the site assessment process consists of the evaluation and the placement of sites on the NPL. After discovery, the site is evaluated by the regions, States, or Federal agencies by a preliminary assessment (PA). A PA is an initial screening of the site in which all available data (e.g., past industrial activity, permit history, location of drinking water intakes) are collected and reviewed. If warranted by the PA, a site inspection (SI) is conducted. A SI involves on-site work that usually includes collection and analysis of suspected contaminated soil, surface water, groundwater, and air samples. In many instances, integrated assessments, which combine activities of the PA, SI, and removal assessment, are conducted at sites. If warranted by the SI, the site is formally evaluated for placement on the NPL. To determine an HRS score, all of the data gathered during the PA and SI stages are analyzed using the HRS. The HRS packages?documentation of the Agency's rationale, data, scoring procedures, overall score, and references?are prepared by the States, EPA regions, Headquarters contractor, and other participants in the NPL process. The packages are submitted through the regional EPA offices to OSRTI. The OSRTI NPL coordinator for each EPA region reviews the initial submission of a site package to ensure basic quality control standards are met. If they are, the HRS package is forwarded to the contractor to provide support by performing a detailed quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) review and analysis. After QA/QC reviews are completed, sites with an HRS score of 28.5 or greater are eligible for proposal to the NPL. For those sites determined to be appropriate for NPL listing, the HRS packages are placed in the Superfund docket for public review when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. Placing sites on the NPL is a two-stage process. First, sites are proposed to the NPL, and a 60-day comment period follows. The public comments on proposed sites are evaluated for technical accuracy and policy issues, and detailed responses are prepared. Second, following analysis and response to the public comments, sites still meeting the scoring criteria are placed on the NPL via a final rule. After a final rule, a period of 90 days is allowed for the public to file legal challenges to the Agency?s decision to place the sites on the final NPL. The Site Assessment and Remedy Decisions Branch (SARDB) in OSRTI is responsible for discovering sites, evaluating their potential threat to human health and the environment, implementing the HRS, proposing and adding them to the NPL and maintaining public information regarding these activities via the web and other OSRTI data systems. A key component of implementing the HRS is evaluating exposure pathways, including surface and groundwater contamination. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE) The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is:? 18,000 hours per year for a five (5) year contract? 18,000 hours per year for two (2) one (1) year award terms? 10,000 hours per year optional quantities ordered in increments for each year of the contract and each award term. (Maximum potential LOE of 28,000 hours per year, with a maximum potential seven (7) year LOE of 196,000 total hours) CAPABILITY STATEMENT: To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft SOW. The Government requests demonstration of capability by interested parties through submittal of capability statements. The government will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft SOW. All capability statements must: 1. Not exceed and will be restricted up to ten (10) single-sided pages in length.2. Be electronically submitted to the email address below by the stated deadline.3. Include small business classification(s): (Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.) 4. Address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to: (a) the key task areas in the draft SOW; and (b) the overall business demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules. 5. List references as well as demonstrate experience in conducting projects of similar size, scope, and complexity in the past 5 years.6. State the (a) average number of employees of the concern; (b) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; (c) other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.); and (d) a description of the concern?s accounting system for estimating and accumulating costs under cost-reimbursement contracts?and whether or not those system(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.7. Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability to meet the needs of the anticipated level of effort and scope of this requirement. Note that any resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting. The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive capability statements when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting RFP(s). The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps and EPA's website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm., under the ?Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) and Hazards Ranking System (HRS) Technical Support? link.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is seeking qualified businesses interested in providing "call when needed" helicopter charter services in Kodiak Alaska.  The total requirement is estimated to be 20 hours between May 1 and December 31, 2010.

The Coast Guard anticipates a requirement for a Bell 206L (or similarly capable) helicopter to accommodate projected personnel loads, equipment, supplies and distances.  It is a requirement that the helicopter and pilot be based in Kodiak as time may not allow and no payment will be made for transit time to/from Kodiak before and after chartered flights.  Both the helicopter(s) and pilot(s) must be carded by the Office of Aviation Safety (OAS) and the U.S. Forest Service.

Exact location of flights have not been determined at this time, however multiple areas on Kodiak Island, Katmai National Park, Ugak Island, and East Chugach Island are planned.
Interested vendors who feel that they meet the above listed requirements for Kodiak based, OAS/USFS carded helicopter charter services should contact the Contracting Officer, via e-mail at mari.k.meiners@uscg.mil.  All qualified parties will be given consideration.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>F1M3F10043A001
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is F1M3F10043A001. The 437th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, requires all inclusive service and maintenance agreement for the Z-Portal Cargo and Vehicle Screening System located at Charleston AFB, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The 437th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to American Science and Engineering, Inc., 826 Middlesex Turnpike, BILLERICA, MA 01821. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement in the US.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read: The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to response to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the appointed due date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposal based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>

AS&amp;E has also designed the software that operates the Z Backscatter Portal and has it copyrighted. If the equipment was to breakdown and they were not at our disposal, it would adversely affect the mission. Award shall be made in the aggregate all or none.</p>
<p>AS&amp;E is the only known source that can satisfy the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to search the market for vendors who can provide services that will fulfill the preventive maintenance and repair requirements for the <br />Z-Portal System.</p>
