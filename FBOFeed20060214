<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Contracting Officer 7037871263     Sharon.Teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.   The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Massachusetts Audubon (Mass Audubon), Lincoln, MA, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The MMS anticipates awarding a purchase order to Mass Audubon to capture, radio tag, track and map 25 long-tailed ducks in Nantucket Sound, MA in order to gather information on night-time roosting locations for this species.  This information is specifically to be used by MMS in assessing potential environmental impacts to long-tailed ducks from a proposed offshore wind farm located in Nantucket Sound (Cape Wind Project).  The study is a collaborative effort between Mass Audubon, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  This study is time-sensitive for two main reasons: (1) long-tailed ducks will migrate out of Nantucket Sound in April so data must be collected before that time; and (2) night-time use of Nantucket Sound is an important data gap that MMS needs filled in order to adequately analyze environmental impacts to long-tailed ducks from the proposed Cape Wind Project. Mass Audubon has been involved for the last two and a half years in studies relative to bird abundance, distribution and use of Nantucket Sound, with a specific intent of assessing potential impacts to birds, if any, from the proposed Cape Wind Project.  Their collaboration with the USGS and USFWS brings in additional expertise and in-kind donations of equipment, thus promoting effective cost-sharing and reducing the overall costs to government.  This study is anticipated to be 8 weeks in duration and cost MMS $53,732. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541710 "Environmental research and development laboratories or services.:"  This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQA) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received by the POC listed below by close of business Friday, February 17, 2006, will be considered by the government.  POC: Sharon Teger, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon VA 20170.  Questions must be emailed to Sharon.Teger@mms.gov or faxed to Sharon Teger at 703-787-1041.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a sole-source contract with Thomas L. Eckes, Ellicott City, MD to provide security consultant services for FDA facilities nationwide.  A sole-source, fixed-price, commercial services contract is anticipated, and will be prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6.  The contract will be for a base year and two one-year option years.  There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates.  The associated NAICS code is 561621 –Security Systems Services (Except Locksmiths) and the small business size standard is $10.5M.   There is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development of physical security design of security systems and implementation plans of the FDA White Oak Consolidation Project and other FDA select agent laboratories which require restricted access due to threats of terrorist attacks.  This is in accordance with Executive Order 13224 and George W. Bush’s proclamation of September 14th, 2001, which declared national emergency to deal with threat of further attacks on the United States.  These unique services are only available from the existing contractor who has been actively involved in the security design of the White Oak campus from its inception over 10 years ago.  The existing contractor is also heavily involved in the design and planning of new White Oak facilities to include the Central Shared Use Facility, which will house a state of the art command center, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health Laboratory and the truck screening facility.  Security design and planning of these facilities require daily meetings, walk downs of construction sites and active involvement with all other participating contractors to include architects, electrical contractors, security system installation contractors and other construction contractors.  The incumbent contractor has detailed knowledge pertaining specifically to the implementation and planning of FDA projects, and the unique specifics of FDA’s system.  Additionally, the Contractor has detailed institutional knowledge of FDA operations, security policies, procedures and standards, which are vital to proper security system design and management.  Introduction of a different vendor would certainly require a prolonged learning period to acquire sufficient knowledge to perform, thus generating thousands of dollars in costs due to duplication of effort that are unlikely to be recovered through competition.  Further, the design and construction of a number of new buildings are already underway at the site.  Construction at the White Oak project is progressing at an accelerated pace.  Construction drawings and specifications require detailed and timely review in order to ensure that the agency’s security requirements are met, and to avoid costly design errors.  Delay in acquiring the needed services, combined with the aforementioned learning period, would adversely impact the project schedule and may result in construction delays, thus generating thousands of dollars in costs to the agency; and simply would not meet the agency’s requirement for expert services performed in a timely manner.  The services provided by the contractor are necessary if FDA is to meet its mission and the requirements of the law as stated above.  The Contractor has designed numerous FDA MDI security systems for the last 15 years to include card access, CCTV, emergency call stations, bollards, barriers, etc. up to and including programming all access levels and testing and acceptance of systems.  The Contractor has detailed knowledge pertaining specifically to the implementation and planning of FDA projects, and the unique specifics of FDA’s system.  Additionally, the Contractor has detailed institutional knowledge of FDA operations, security policies, procedures and standards, which are vital to proper security system design and management.  Statement of Work:  The Food and Drug Administration requires assistance in security system design and programming of their MDI security network system for various FDA offices nationwide including the developing White Oak Campus, MD.  The facility at White Oak is being built as a campus environment with 23 buildings on approximately 400 acres of the 500-acre site.  The migration of FDA offices to White Oak is expected to be performed in five phases over a 9-year period.  The campus has been an on-going project with the Agency for the last 10 years.  Construction at the White Oak project is progressing at an accelerated pace.  Construction drawings and specifications require detailed and timely review in order to ensure that the agency’s security requirements are met, and to avoid costly design errors.  The agency requires services from a contractor having detailed knowledge pertaining specifically to the implementation and planning of FDA projects, and the unique specifics of FDA’s system.  Additionally, the agency requires the Contractor to have detailed institutional knowledge of FDA operations, security policies, procedures and standards, which are vital to proper security system design and management.  The contractor must have detailed specific knowledge of all elements of the FDA White Oak security plan; be Monitor Dynamics Inc. certified and have a minimum of eight years of experience in designing FDA specific MDI security systems to include access systems, CCTV systems, intrusion alarms, bollards, barriers, locking hardware, lighting and any other phases of security system design.  The contractor must also be able to provide FDA specific MDI design system configuration of all MDI panels, wire runs, oversight of system installation, integration and testing.  The contractor will be required to monitor the performance of security system installers and related contractors throughout the construction process to ensure that work is being performed in accordance with agency requirements.  The Food & Drug Administration’s Physical Security Branch requires ongoing assistance to prepare newly defined and necessary technical security system documentation and security system designs relative to new facilities and ongoing projects specifically tailored to FDA’s security requirements, perform technical research and provide security system design drawings for various nationwide FDA facilities.  FDA new construction projects and relocations require physical security system designs, security recommendations, programming and services to the FDA Monitor Dynamics Inc. Security System Network, including the White Oak campus.  The contractor will be required to tailor system requirements to the agency’s needs and mission.  The contractor must have over eight years of experience in designing FDA specific security system design schemes and over three years of experience in designing systems tailored specifically to FDA’s security requirements at the White Oak campus to include programming of FDA’s MDI security system network.  The contractor is required to have an up to date on-going knowledge of the design and construction phases of the FDA White Oak campus security system requirements as facilities are being phased in on an accelerated construction schedule.  The White Oak Consolidation project was initiated over 10 years ago.  Integration of FDA specific security measures from the perimeter of the entire campus to security measures for interior space has been an ongoing project since that time which has incorporated program needs and agency security requirements.  These measures have been incorporated into architectural drawings to include wiring diagrams for  CCTV surveillance and other security installations of code blue equipment for the entire campus to include the White Oak Command Center.  The history and knowledge of this ongoing project in regards to security system installations and construction of the campus, and the specific security needs of FDA programs is needed (to work in coordination with other FDA programs) in order for the agency's timely completion of the campus.  FDA has been using the MDI system for over eight years and, therefore, it is necessary to acquire services from a security consultant with over eight years of MDI technology knowledge.  Under this Statement of Work, the following tasks are to be performed:  1. Perform extended planning of FDA specific physical security system design, recommendations and surveys to include the White Oak campus and other nationwide FDA sites to include project meetings and design meetings with associated architects, GSA and FDA lessors.  2. Review security system technology to ensure that the design and products selected are in keeping with the future direction of the Agency. 3. Develop FDA specific security system wiring schemes and output schematics for each new or relocated FDA facility that meets the final design criteria.  Perform all levels of programming for each facility, to include developing classes or levels of access, intrusion alarm points, and maps, etc., which requires specific knowledge of FDA’s programming requirements. 4. Monitor the performance of security system installers and related contractors throughout the construction process to ensure that work is being performed in accordance with agency requirements. 5. Perform development of FDA specific security system designs for all FDA White Oak facilities. 6. Attend project meetings, review and comment on security design and plans, work closely with other vendors, and interface with the GSA and FDA Centers and District Office and Lab officials to meet the needs of the agency. Draft meeting notes and other applicable documents describing the results of the meetings.  7. Develop government cost estimates to include cost/benefit analysis, position papers and review plans for contractors and subcontractors for installation of materials.  8. Assist in the development of presentations and project reports.  9. Coordinate and facilitate meetings.

Eckes, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.  All responsible sources that intend to submit descriptive literature shall submit it by COB on the due date referenced above to the following address or e-mail:  Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2083, HFA-500, Rockville, Maryland  20857-0001 or Lorena.Forgosh@fda.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking contractors to cleanup downed material on the Natchez Trace Parkway resulting from Hurricane Katrina.

Some of the work has already been addressed by Parkway crews, but significant work remains to be accomplished.   The work required in this procurement is intended to restore the Parkway to its pre-Katrina appearance and includes debris removal from the mowline area, removal of hazardous limbs, stump grinding, clearing trails, and vegetative fuel reduction in one of the Parkway campground areas.  The contractor(s) will be required to remove all material and haul away to an approved disposal site.  There are five project areas included in this contract and contractors may bid on any or all of the five areas.  Note that multiple awards may result from this solicitation.

Work in area 3 includes debris removal, stump grinding, and hazardous limb removal, all at an estimated magnitude of between $100,000 to $200,000.  Project Area #4 runs from milepost 181 to milepost 245 in Choctaw, Webster, Clay and Chickasaw Counties, Mississippi.  Work in area 4 includes debris removal, stump grinding, and hazardous limb removal, all at an estimated magnitude of between $100,000 to $200,000.  Project Area #5 is the Jeff Busby Campground, located at milepost 193 in Choctaw County, Mississippi.  Work in this area includes vegetative fuel reduction of approximately 200 acres at an estimated magnitude of between $100,000 to $200,000.

Only sources that have been approved under the qualification            requirement will be considered for contract award. Contractors interested in     manufacturing the Faring Strips must request copy of the specification and       drawing package from the Contract Specialist at NAVICP: Naval Inventory Control  Point Code 846.1, 5450 Carlisle Pike, PO Box 2020 Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 Ph     (717) 605-2373 Email Janet.Machamer@navy.mil or from the engineering activity,   Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division,, Code  622, Philadelphia, PA 19112- 1403.

<DESC>NASA LaRC has a requirement for the development of a suite of software tools, including licenses, training, and upgrades/maintenance of existing LaRC Wake Interactive Development and Analysis Tools (WIDAT) and the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Air Space Simulation and Analysis for TERPS (ASAT).  The software will encompass a full implementation of NASA's Aircraft Vortex Spacing System (AVOSS) algorithm in a modular and updatable/upgradeable/enhanceable manner in conjunction with a 3D visualization of an AVOSS model generated output.  The software must be fully compatible with the FAA's ASAT exclusive system.  The software shall provide high fidelity models and empirical data representing most components of aviation scenarios.  The components shall include aircraft characteristics; geographical and physical environments; atmospheric conditions; onboard avionics and ground and space based navigational aids; air traffic detection systems; and human factors aspects on both the pilot and air traffic controller side.  The software suite shall provide full Monte Carlo analysis and simulation capabilities.  The objective of this requirement is to provide NASA with the capability to facilitate efficient ways of studying new concepts of air traffic operations involving existing and/or new wake vortex models. The period of performance for the software development will be 12 months with four 1-year option periods for upgrades and maintenance.  NASA LaRC intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Air Traffic Simulation, Inc. (ATSI) for the development of the software, including licenses, training, and upgrades/maintenance.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only One Responsible Source".  This is based on the fact that ATSI was the only source responsible for the development of the original software suite of tools and the software is proprietary to ATSI only.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See note 22.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS 

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. REASONABLE CARE: 1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below: Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: (a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and (b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>Request for Information
Lajes Field Air Base, Azores, Portugal is seeking information regarding possibly leasing out an existing liquid oxygen / liquid nitrogen production plant located at Lajes Field,  Azores, Portugal.   Specifically, the 65 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) is seeking information that may assist in the development of a “Lease Agreement” between the United States Air Force (USAF) and a contractor for the operation of a cryogenic production plant.  The 65th LRS is also soliciting information to determine the availability of capable contractors that can accomplish this task.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, it is issued solely for informational and planning purposes.  The United States Government will not be committed to a contract for any supplies or services resulting from this RFI.

The contractor will bear all costs relevant to ensuring the plant is in compliance with governing laws etc.

NOTE: ALL COSTS INCLUDING TRAVEL RELATED COSTS WILL BE AT THE CONTRACTOR’S OWN EXPENSE.  

Background: 
In January 2001, the USAF purchased a 5-ton cryogenic production plant from Pacific Consolidated Industries (PCI) located in California for Lajes Field Air Base, Terceira, Azores, Portugal.  The plant operated for four years producing (LOX) and (LIN).  In November 2005, it was determined that it would be more cost effective to procure LOX and LIN from a commercial source, subsequently the production plant was shut down.

Information Requested:
In responding to this RFI, the USAF requests interested vendors to submit information on the following subjects. 
Note: Please number your responses to match the question numbers below:

1.Briefly describe how your company would plan to operate this plant.
2.Is it possible for your company to provide free cryogenic products (i.e., LOX & LIN) in consideration for the USAF in exchange for the use of the cryogenic plant to produce LOX/LIN for commercial sources?  If not, what kind of offer would your company be willing to give the USAF?
3.Is your company willing to accept all utility costs associated with operating the plant (i.e. water, electric, facility maintenance)?  
4.Describe your expectations concerning how the products would be stored/issued/billed.
5.An estimated timeframe necessary for your company to implement your proposed lease.
6.Provide all correspondence and responses in English.

A site visit is scheduled as follows: 
Place: Bldg. T-824, Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal 
Date: 6 March 2006
Time: 09:00 hrs. – 13:00 hrs. 
If interested in attending the site visit, please provide your ID information or foreign passport information no later than 24 Feb 2006, to obtain and arrange for access to Lajes  Field.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the NAICS code FROM: 541990, TO: 541614.            The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for technical, administrative, and logistical support services supporting the National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) Peer Review activities.   The contractor shall make logistical arrangements to secure meeting space for peer review panel meetings, and supply all required equipment for the meetings, including necessary computer equipment.  The contractor shall include administrative support, to include collecting, collating, typing, proofing, copying, and tabulating peer review results.  The contractor will not provide actual peer review expert services.   NCER provides a 1-800 Hotline, as well as an e-mail address, to help provide information to potential and actual applicants.  The hotline is a voice-recorded-user-activated information hotline (does not provide real-time interaction with the caller) which is available to the public 24 hours a day; this is also true of the NCER e-mail address.  The contractor shall access these systems and provide the caller with the requested information.  EPA will provide the contractor with a scripted answering protocol for frequently asked questions.   The contractor shall also maintain the Peer Review Panelist Information System, which is an electronic database of potential reviewers, and contains data on areas of specialization, degrees received, optically scanned curriculum vitae, and contact information for peer reviewers who have authorized EPA to retain their names.   A performance-based, cost-plus-fixed-fee, level of effort (LOE) contract is anticipated.  The period of performance is estimated at one 12-month base period plus four option periods of 12 months each.  The total amount of LOE for all periods and all quantity options is estimated at 74,900 hours.   The proposed contract is anticipated to be a 100% set-aside for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) concerns.  All responsible firms that qualify as SDVOSB may respond to the Request for Proposal (RFP) when it is issued.  All proposals  will be evaluated by the Agency in accordance with the technical evaluation criteria specified in the RFP.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990, and the size standard is $6.5M.  Solicitation PR CI-06-10141 will only be released through the internet.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-02-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 Mar 05; FY 06 by 1 Mar 06; and FY 07 by 15 Nov 06.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2007, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to use innovative, disruptive technologies to collect and process ELINT signals and their associated SIGINT information.  Technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and enhanced or new digital processing hardware/software, will be used to:  (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems;  (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection optimization and management;  and (3) Automate digital signal processing hardware and software analysis to enable a man-on-the-loop concept to address the increased volume of data and increased time criticality of analysis, both necessary to support Effects Based Operations of the future. 

The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following:  (1) Target specific characteristics identification/ correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) levels;   (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing; and (6) Network centric collection management .

Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows:  (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation:  Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT and Electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources.  One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort:  (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing.  Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board / off-board assets.  This area should also allow for the improvement in signal sorting and identification, discrimination ('flagging') of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values can readily be characterized.  Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and deinterleaving processes using 'fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated tracking efforts; Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars.  (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing:  Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena.  Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, methods employing horizontal, parallel processing, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems. (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives:  Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Host processing systems will be low power and weight so the resident software processing systems will need to employ a digital receiver and processing schema that operate modularly, in parallel, and in firmware.  (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques:  Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (6) Network centric collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include but not be limited to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-int sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management.  Deliverables will be technical reports, any software developed, and, when appropriate, demonstrations. 

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $8.0M; FY 06 - $8.5M; and FY07 - $8.0M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $250,000 to $350,000 per fiscal year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  

2. COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.

IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

1.  APPLICATION PACKAGE:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. WE ARE SOLICITATING WHITE PAPERS ONLY. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. See Section VI of this announcement for further details.

<DESC>This is Modification 3 to the synopsis entitled TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA KSC TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE which was posted on February 2, 2006. A conformed version of the synopsis is hereby restated in its entirety, to include additional information on the NASA KSC Technology Transfer Office Call for Proposals, all Technology Areas posted to date, and the addition of Technology Area 7 entitled "Development of Calibration Subsystem for Gas Analysis Instrumentation". CONFORMED SYNOPSIS: NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP).  Background: The Technology Transfer Office is responsible for implementation of the Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) at KSC. One of the primary missions of the IPP is to “provide leveraged technology alternatives for Mission Directorates, Programs, and Projects through joint partnerships with industry, academia, non-profit organizations, government agencies and national laboratories.” The NASA KSC Technology Transfer Office released a Call for Proposals on January 25th, 2006, soliciting proposals from NASA KSC Scientists for dual-use projects relevant to NASA’s mission-related challenges, consisting of a minimum of 25% cost-sharing (in-kind and cash contributions) from the Non-NASA Partner, and 75% cost-sharing from NASA KSC. The NASA KSC Call for Proposals closes March 10, 2006, and the nominal award amount resulting from this Call is anticipated to be between $50K and $150K.  The ultimate goal of the Call for Proposals is to develop products that meet the needs of both NASA KSC and the Partner. Some expected benefits for both NASA KSC and the Partner include an: (1) increased range of technology solutions (e.g., a broadened portfolio); (2) reduction in costs; (3) accelerated maturation of technologies; and a (4) larger pool of qualified commercial providers. NASA KSC is seeking Partners to participate with NASA KSC Scientists to develop and execute proposals in the specific areas defined below. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that selected proposal(s) would result in cost-sharing contracts, cooperative agreements, and/or space act agreements. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates.  Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience consistent with the requirements for each KSC technology area outlined below. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA. Partner selection(s) will be made by KSC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  3) Cost sharing – This criterion evaluates the proposer’s cost-sharing level and quality. 4) Facilities. This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to two (2) pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses shall be submitted to: John F. Kennedy Space Center, Attn: Rosemary Baize, Mail Code KT-F, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899; or via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is February 24, 2006. Procurement questions shall be directed to Krista Jensen, NASA KSC Procurement Office, Krista.Y.Jensen@nasa.gov. Technical questions shall be directed to Rosemary Baize at the email address noted above.  The specific technology areas follow: 1) Global Environmental Micro Sensors NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development and field testing of a miniaturized atmospheric sensor system. Specifically, the Global Environmental Micro Sensors (GEMS) Test Operations in the Natural Environment (GEMSTONE) project has a requirement for a prototype miniaturized sensor system capable of making in-situ measurements of the following atmospheric variables as a function of position and time: (1) temperature, (2) relative humidity, (3) pressure and (4) vector wind velocity. The individual sensors must be sufficiently small and lightweight to remain aloft for several days in the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere upon deployment from a balloon or aircraft. This may be accomplished by buoyancy or aerodynamic means or both. The individual sensors must be self-contained including all required power and communications to transmit the sensor data to the ground either directly or via satellite link. Production units must be sufficiently inexpensive to deploy in large quantities (thousands per mission) as disposables. In addition, the production units must meet FAA requirements for use in controlled airspace in the same manner as current commercially available radiosondes. Accuracy of measurements must be comparable to these radiosondes. Sensor measurements must be taken in one-minute (or less) intervals with data available on the ground within five minutes in the operational version of the system. Qualifying partners must have experience in meteorological instrumentation, data acquisition, and data assimilation including automated quality control. 2) Statistical Forecasting of Lightning Cessation  NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to develop statistical techniques to forecast the last lighting strike. KSC is seeking techniques to more accurately assess when the last lightning strike has occurred in a thunderstorm to improve the capability of forecasters to terminate lightning warnings earlier. Accurate lightning warnings are a crucial operational requirement, critical to both personnel safety and resource protection. However, the tools available to forecasters to provide accurate lightning cessation predictions within a 20 mile radius of the launch pad are deficient. Consequently, forecasters are conservative in terminating lightning warnings, thus shutting down operations at KSC far longer than necessary and adversely impacting both ground operations costs and schedule.  The partner will be required to develop statistical techniques based upon data from an extensive local weather infrastructure; archived data from the 45th Space Wing lightning detection systems; KSC’s extensive field mill network, which measures the electric field near the surface and; KSC’s unique Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) system. The LDAR system provides observations of cloud-to-ground discharges, intra and inter-cloud discharges, and is used to identify, with spatial resolution typically better than 200 meters, the development and evolution of thunderstorm electrical discharge patterns in relation to thunderstorm structure. Additional information on LDAR data is available at : http://microwave.nsstc.nasa.gov:5721/dataset_documents/ldar_dataset.html . Based on earlier, exploratory studies, this combination of data should help yield a greatly improved lightning cessation forecast tool. Upon development of the statistical techniques, the partner will be required to test and verify the technique against real-world data sets. Qualifying partners must have a demonstrated track record in lightning analysis and forecasting, including a methodology for specifying how accurate the proposed technique is relative to actual test data. In addition, partners must be able to integrate data from multiple sources and have familiarity with the latest weather prediction tools including numerical weather prediction models, satellite and radar data. Knowledge of KSC’s LDAR system is considered a plus.  3) Development of Paint Product for Aerospace Applications NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development of a paint product based on a novel smart coating system for aerospace applications. This smart coating is based on the controlled release of microcapsules for early corrosion detection and inhibition without human intervention. The coating has the capacity of incorporating and releasing on demand newly developed corrosion inhibitors. The overall objective of this collaborative project is not to provide just one coating system with a given function, but to provide a systematic methodology which can then be effectively be used for testing newly developed inhibitors in paint systems. The selected partner will be required to work with NASA personnel to address the optimal substrate to coat; the coat system (single or multi-coat); the desired properties of the coating (e.g., hardness, UV resistance, etc.); the projected lifetime of the coating; and the expected cost-per-gallon for raw materials. NASA personnel will provide the typical substrates and exposure conditions experience at the KSC launch site.  Qualifying partners must have demonstrated experience in developing industrial and marine coatings. In addition, potential partners must be knowledgeable in applicable ASTM and federal environmental compliance standards. Familiarity with corrosion coatings is considered a plus. 4) Metal Oxide Coatings  NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the application of metal oxide coatings utilizing plasma spraying. Potential partners must have a plasma spray system to be utilized in this collaboration, which meets the following characteristics: (1) the ability to control the attitude of the plasma system (one possible solution is to mount the plasma gun on a robotic arm which enables 360 degree orientation of the spray); (2) the capacity to measure particle temperature, velocity and distribution within the plasma, and finally, (3) the capacity to spray a plasma with either nano- and micron-sized particles (solid precursors) or liquid precursors.  Qualifying partners must have a plasma spray system and experience in and ability to perform surface analysis (e.g., X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, etc.) of the coatings.  5) Atmospheric Plasma Glow Discharge (APGD) Device:  KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development and laboratory testing of a hand-held atmospheric plasma glow discharge (APGD) device. Specifically, KSC desires a compact device that is capable of producing stable plasmas in reactive gases such as O2 and inert gases such as He. The device must operate at temperatures that allow the plasmas to be applied to polymer surfaces without causing damage to the polymers.  Qualifying partners must have experience in manufacturing RF or microwave plasma sources, plasma diagnostics, and the use of atmospheric plasma devices for research and/or medical applications. 6) Microwave Sintering of Loose Materials:  NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) with expertise in manufacturing microwaves specifically designed for laboratory use. A serious concern at a future lunar launch pad will be the amount of dust and flying object debris (FOD) kicked up by rocket exhaust. A potential solution to this problem is to form a layer of larger agglomerates of regolith that will cover the loose regolith and prevent the FOD problem. Loose regolith may be sintered into larger pieces, or bricks, using a standard microwave. It is the goal of this project to develop methods for microwave sintering of lunar regolith into building materials that will prevent FOD problems during launches. The project will identify 1) the ideal conditions for microwave sintering lunar regolith, 2) the components of the regolith are more suited to microwave sintering and 3) any promising additives. This project will support future exploration systems work, especially ISRU, dust mitigation and operations.  Qualifying partners must have experience in sintering of ceramics. Features sought in the laboratory microwave include: (1) a magnetron pulse cycle of 1-2 seconds to allow for a more uniform heating process; (2) variable frequency (optimal range 2GHz-3GHz) and wattage control knob to allow precise tuning of the microwave; (3) stainless steel interior walls to avoid hot spots; (4) a ductwork connection to eliminate fumes; and (5) minimum interior dimensions of 6"x6"x6" capable of holding a mold for powdered materials. 7) Development of Calibration Subsystem for Gas Analysis Instrumentation: NASA KSC is currently seeking a partner to collaborate in the development of a calibration subsystem for gas analysis instrumentation.  Background: The Hazardous Gas Detection Lab at KSC intends to develop a prototype calibration subsystem.	The subsystem will be compatible with a variety of commercially available gas analyzers.  The unique aspect of this calibration subsystem is that it will be integrated into small field-able instruments, thus allowing for highly accurate, near-real time data for gas analysis from a portable instrument.  This is important to NASA KSC, since there are many systems involved with launch operations that require portable and highly accurate gas detection.  Such applications include imbedded sensors, health monitoring systems, hazardous leak detection, Insitu Resource Utilization (ISRU) process control, ISRU quality control, and exploratory gas analyzers. Once the prototype calibration system is completed, the selected partner will be required to participate in the testing of the prototype.  Once testing is complete, the selected partner will be required to refine the design of the calibration subsystem, so that it can be integrated with a majority of commercial mass spectrometer gas analyzers. Qualifying participants must have experience and expertise in: the design, manufacture and packaging of gas detection mass spectrometers for commercial purpose and; ion trap mass spectrometry with particular focus in field portable instruments. ***************************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************* The due date for responses remains unchanged as February 24, 2006.

Contracting Office Address:  Fleet & Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Suite 600, Code 40, 1968 Gilbert Street, Norfolk, VA  23511-3392

Description:  The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk is seeking information on Small Business sources that can provide services under the following proposed contract(Large Businesses do not respond please):
The proposed contract will facilitate work in direct support of the Navy Personnel Research Studies and Technology (NPRST) manpower, personnel, training and education research using web and wireless technologies, data and database technologies, and modeling and simulation enhancement and development.  Elements of web and wireless technology are widely used, but the use of these technologies in modeling and simulation, survey assessment, and performance posting is narrowly explored. These technologies will offer NPRST customers greater access to tools that are conducive to their mobile and expansive environment.  Also, data currency, availability, access, manipulation, linkage, use, security, storage, and maintenance are critical for conducting research and providing guidance to NPRST clients.  NPRST needs expertise to assist with eliminating hindrances with respect to model development, operation, testing, data mining and analysis, and trends assessments.  Finally, as the human resource enterprise seeks to become less stove-piped, the tools developed will require better integration, information delivery, and ease of use. While specific tasks will be outlined in task orders, generally these tasks will be related to: 1) web and wireless technologies for modeling and simulation access, survey implementation, and performance posting; 2) data base design, development, linkage, and maintenance; and 3) model development, evaluation, redesign, update, enhancements and integration, and maintenance.  The contract will expand research conducted in modeling and simulation, data and information access, and organizational assessment for manpower managers and analysts in such a way that it minimizes the technical requirements from the user.  

For the purposes of Small Businesses, the NAICS Code is 541512 and the Size Standard is $21M.  Your response shall include the following information:  Size of company, i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SB, Veteran, all others, number of employees, revenue for the past 3 years, relevant past performance on contracts that provided for the same or similar type work as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Experience should date back no more than 5 years.  You should fully describe your company's capability to perform the type of work identified in the PWS.  Documentation of technical expertise shall be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Please indicate if your company can be a prime contractor for this effort or, if not, whether your company can be a subcontractor.  Your Past Performance information should include contract number, point of contact, phone number, fax and e-mail for the point of contact, and a description of the relevance and magnitude of the contract as compared to this acquisition.  This information should be sent to FISC Norfolk by close of business (COB) Tuesday, 22 November 2005, Attn:  Nancy L. White, Suite 600, Code 240C1, Norfolk, VA  23511-3392 or by e-mail at nancy.l.white@navy.mil with a copy to marlene.chambley@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) plans to extend the current contract with the Public Health Institute, Oakland, California, using other than full and open competition for Maintenance of the Child Health and Development Studies Name and Address Files.  The determination to use other than full and open competition was made in accordance with 41 USC 253 © (1) and is based upon the following factors: 1) The Public Health Institute was awarded a contract in 1991 extended in 1996 and 2001 using other than full and open competition as follow-on contracts which was under N01-HD-1-3334 under the same title.  The current contractor, Public Health Institute, maintains the name and address data files of the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) and provides a service to investigators in contacting and maintaining confidentiality of the 50,000 subjects in the Child Health and Development Studies who are known to the contractor. 2) The contract to the Public Health Institute is designed to maintain the extensive CHDS name and address files in a manner that preserves patient confidentiality while enabling investigators to pursue new research questions in this uniquely well characterized population of subjects.  The proposed extension will take another five (5) years.  The current contractor possesses unique capabilities to maintain these data files.  The current principal investigator and associates participated in developing the extensive CHDS data files that are currently being maintained, augmented, and linked to other registries in California.  (See Numbered Note 22).  An organization capable of performing this task without a costly and significant break in work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements as described above.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  The required service is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this Synopsis to:  Ms. Mya N.

<DESC>The United States of America Department of Agriculture (USDA) through its Rural Development mission area (RD), jointly referred to as the Agency, provides support and services that improve the quality of life in rural communities.   
	
The Agency has received appropriated federal funding for a USDA Voucher (“Voucher”) Demonstration Program and Revitalization Initiative (RI) Demonstration Program, authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1949, Section 542.  To implement the demonstration programs, the Agency plans to procure the following real estate related services:  (1) market rent comparability studies of selected RD-financed multifamily properties across the Nation, (2) comprehensive needs assessments of certain existing RD-financed multifamily properties, (3) training, guidance, regulation preparation and advice on revitalizing RD-financed multifamily properties and administering a Voucher program, and (4) administer the RD vouchers to tenants on certain RD-financed multifamily properties which prepay.
 
The purpose of this notice is to obtain comments from potentially interested sources capable of managing the work required for the resulting contract or those parties interested in performing a segment of the work to be procured.  

The Voucher Demonstration Program is designed to provide rental housing assistance vouchers to tenants residing in properties that prepay their RD mortgage.  The amount of this subsidy is the difference between the comparable market rent for the property and the amount of rent being paid by the tenant when prepayment occurs.  To establish the appropriate amount of rental subsidy for the tenant voucher, the Agency must determine the comparable market rent in the general area of a prepaying property.   Prepaying properties may be located throughout the United States and its territories.  The contractor will provide a market study identifying the comparable market rents for properties approved for prepayment.  

The RI Demonstration Program is designed to provide the existing RD-financed properties with financial assistance to renovate and repair affordable rural rental housing.  The determination of the amount of financial assistance needed to repair and maintain the property will require a Comprehensive Needs Assessment (CNA).  This CNA is a report that forecasts the financial maintenance needs of a property over the next 20 years.  The contractor will be expected to either be capable of providing these CNA reports themselves or contract with other providers for these reports.  These CNA reports must meet specific RD standards.

The contractor must have extensive knowledge of the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to all four related service requirements and sufficient to recommend adjustments and/or revisions as may be appropriate.  If the contractor is unable to provide the technical expertise to perform one or more of the functions, the contractor will be required to manage contractors that have the technical expertise to perform those functions. The Agency anticipates contracting for services to assist in developing regulations, guides, and training materials to implement these programs.

The final function is the administration of the Voucher program.  In FY 2006, the Voucher program will be operated similar to the Housing Choice Voucher Program administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  USDA Vouchers will be administered by HUD’s network of public housing authorities (PHAs) in areas that are serviced by those agencies.  For areas that are not serviced by the PHAs, the Agency anticipates procuring services from contractors capable of issuing and managing the Voucher process.  The RD field office may be available to assist with site related functions.

The Agency is interested in comments on the feasibility of a single contractor managing all aspects of the work to be performed through sub-contractors for the various components of the tasks to be performed.  The Agency also will consider the feasibility of multiple, single contracts for work to be performed as described above. 

Interested parties may fax their comments and/or notification of interest to: USDA, Rural Development, Procurement Management Division, Attn:  USDA Voucher Demonstration Program & Revitalization Initiative.  Facsimile:  (202) 692-0235

Polling Effects Survey
Request for Information (RFI)
Date:  14 February 2006

This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Any formal solicitation(s) will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Input into the acquisition strategy is encouraged and welcomed.

PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry comments on an anticipated solicitation which will result in the award of an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the Government-Provided Polling Effects Survey in support of Coalition Forces in Iraq.  We anticipate a single award IDIQ contract using NAICS Code 519110.  The small business size standard is $6.5 million.  We anticipate one award to any business size with a total estimated program ceiling of approximately $4,000,000 to $6,000,000.  At this time, we are considering that task orders under this contract will be negotiated as firm-fixed price.  Additionally, we anticipate that the contract will have an ordering period of one (1) base year with two (2) option years to extend the ordering with a total possible ordering period of three (3) years.  Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for this contract.

BACKGROUND:  This contract will replace the two (2) existing contracts in support of performance-based polling surveys throughout Iraq.  These situations do not allow for a full series of options on major long term contracts.  Therefore, it is proposed to eventually solicit and award this new contract.

PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This contractural program will meet Coalition Forces customer requirements for Polling Effects Surveys locations throughout Iraq.

1.	What is your experience with Polling Effect Surveys?
2.	Would you be able to provide a letter of insurability?
3.	What are your thoughts regarding asking for insurance    after a selected contractor has been determined?

5.	What are your concerns with having to perform the required service throughout Iraq?
6.	Do you anticipate sub-contracting opportunities?
7.	What are the most critical criteria that would distinguish one company’s capabilities from another?  Explain.
8.	What are your thoughts regarding the Government requiring the contractor, or possible sub-contractor, not to share; and to safeguard Government-proprietary information resulting from the Polling Effect Surveys to other outside agencies (be it other government or commercial)?

Please submit your feedback and company information to the following email addresses:  darren.cole@iraq.centcom.mil and/or ron.moton@iraq.centcom.mil

<SUBJECT>V -- Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI) Face-to-Face RFI
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION.

This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This synopsis offers an additional opportunity for industry to elaborate on/clarify responses to the RFI and present ideas and comments on the DTCI project in regard to commercial best practices and commercial transportation management capabilities.  The following description and background information was previously posted in our RFI dated 23 Mar 05.

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is responsible for providing for the transportation needs of the Department of Defense. On 16 Sep 03, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) designated the Commander, USTRANSCOM as Distribution Process Owner (DPO).  Among the DPO's key responsibilities are to:

•	Improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution-related activities—deployment, sustainment, and deployment support during peace and war.
•	Serve as the single entity to direct and supervise execution of the Strategic Distribution system.

The DPO's span of influence, as depicted on the following page, is from the factory, beginning with acquisition of needed supplies and materials, to the foxhole, from storage, to transport inter-theatre to transport intra-theatre, and to tactical movement and distribution.   

 

DoD service agencies’ current business processes and segregated transportation management arrangements need to be transformed to reach the desired end state of total asset management and in-transit visibility.  The Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI) is one project moving DoD closer to achieving this goal, focusing on the movement of requisitioned supplies/materials within the Continental United States (CONUS). 

	a.  DTCI Vision Statement:  Improve the reliability, predictability, and efficiency of DoD materiel moving within the Continental United States through a long-term partnership with a world-class coordinator of transportation management services. 

	b.  Goals:

&#61553;	Improve operational effectiveness
&#61553;	Improve visibility, reliability, & predictability
&#61553;	Improve customer confidence 
&#61553;	Reduce cycle times
&#61553;	Increase efficiencies
&#61553;	Use commercial best practices 
&#61553;	Ensure strong small business participation
&#61553;	Performance improvement enabled by metrics 
&#61553;	Reduce overall cost to the government

	c.  Value Proposition:  Improve performance of distribution to CONUS-  
based operational forces and depots--with corollary dollar savings.
     
	d.  Strategy:  Gain management oversight of enterprise-wide transportation requirements and track performance trends and details.  DTCI will:

•	Provide greater opportunities to generate full truck loads and modal shifts
•	Provide opportunities to achieve efficiency through pooling and enroute consolidation
•	Allow DoD management to re-focus more on bottom-line performance and results
•	Provide needed visibility into system-wide transportation movements
•	Support the capture of more effective, complete, and timely performance metrics
•	Provide performance metrics against desired goals
•	Allow for improved management of resources 
•	Allow DoD management and resources to become focused on achieving further gains in distribution efficiency and effectiveness in the future
•	Manage and coordinate previously decentralized DoD domestic freight movement 

The DoD is committed to continual service improvements that will result in improved support of operational forces based in the US as well as DoD repair depots. Improving visibility of all traffic movement patterns and performance across the supply chain is the key to the creation of an adaptive supply chain.  In addition to operational benefits, the corollary dollar savings that will accrue to the DoD Components from DTCI will be available for other critical needs.

2.  BACKGROUND.

Today, DoD shippers in the CONUS initiate freight movements using commercial freight transportation providers to myriad U.S. destinations, creating thousands of origin-destination pairs.  Multiple information systems are employed to execute and manage shipment activity.  There is no centralized planning, coordination, or control.  Individual DoD shippers act unilaterally by independently selecting transportation mode, level of service, and transportation provider.  There is limited collaborative visibility or coordination of movement requirements and therefore there are limited opportunities to leverage the entire DoD workload to create the volume needed to drive increased velocity and reduced cost.  Such leverage is a well recognized “best practice” in high performing private sector distribution systems.

 

	a.  Scope of DTCI:    DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations / load optimization and modal conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator/coordinator(s) that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DoD shippers.  A multiple phased implementation approach is envisioned based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase 1 will begin with the 19 Defense Logistics Agency CONUS distribution centers.  Based on the results of the DLA experience, the next phase may include the current Tailored Transportation Contract participants and other co-located DoD shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  The final phase would include remaining DoD shippers throughout the CONUS. 

The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfill those requirements.

            b.  Requirements:   The DTCI coordinator(s) will provide transportation management services to arrange, coordinate, monitor, and control outbound freight shipments from receipt of shipment request information through final delivery; process timely payment to subcontractors and carriers for services provided; accept, process, and settle claims resulting from loss or damage; manage carrier quality and performance; and assist in the identification and delivery of astray freight; provide In-Transit Visibility (ITV) information to the government’s Global Transportation Network (GTN) within 4 hours of freight pick-up, delivery, and exception notices (any time a planned delivery will not be delivered as required by the shipper).  The contractor must have a near-real-time shipment tracking system and provide full access to the shipper and other government employees specifically designated by the contracting officer.  The contractor must initiate process improvement (continuous network improvements including shipment optimization, consolidation, routing improvements and other value-added services), and the contractor must provide the contract officer or his or her designee with customized management information reports related to shipment volume, costs, and other criteria that characterize and provide performance-related views of the transactions included in this contract.  The potential number of shipments that may be included in this initiative could exceed 2 million shipments a year with a combined freight weight of over 1 billion pounds per year.  The contractor must have the capability to meet surges for wartime and other contingencies.  This contract will have a phased approach predicated by location, commodities, and possibly functionality. 

          c.  Exclusions:  In the initial phase, the government will exclude arms, ammunition, explosives or fireworks; missiles or rockets; narcotics and dangerous drugs; etiologic agents; government firearms and weapons; live animals; bulk commodities; human remains; coins; currency; precious metals; refrigerated cargo; food, fresh, frozen, or requiring refrigeration; postage stamps or stamped envelopes; express small packages less than 150 pounds; postal shipments; unit moves destined for locations outside of the CONUS (by exception); sensitive and classified shipments or any items requiring transportation security service (Constant Surveillance Service is not excluded), the CONUS segment of transportation services provided under the SDDC Universal Services ocean carrier contracts; household goods, privately owned vehicles,  hazardous waste.  During the period of performance of the contract, and based on competitive pricing analysis, government may add some or all of the initially excluded workload to this contract.

	d.  Phased Approach (Draft):  The initial phase of DTCI is a partnership between the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The first phase will service 19 DLA depots: 

 

Subsequent phasing will incorporate additional shipping locations to be served, i.e. locations within a 50-mile radius of the DLA depots (to include current TTC sites), service installations, and other DOD shipping activities.  In final phases, the Military Services and other Defense Agencies will be encompassed into a total DoD partnership.  A jointly staffed Project Management Office (PMO) has been established at USTRANSCOM to develop requirements, execute the acquisition, and provide implementation guidance over the life of the project.

		3)  Phase 3:  Additional Service locations and agencies such as DCMA (selected activities to be identified in the RFP).

	e.  Industry Interaction:  To build upon DoD’s strong partnership with industry and to ensure a smooth and effective transition to the DTCI, many communication channels have been established to facilitate this exchange:

•	Industry Day meetings, to provide and update information to potential bidders
•	Presentations and participation at Industry Association and other government conferences and meetings
•	DTCI website, www.doddtci.org 
•	Briefings and communication vehicles for multiple non-industry audiences (i.e., Congressional DoD oversight committee staffs, Small Business Administration, and  internal DoD customers)

	f.  Key Milestones (Projected):

Third Quarter FY 2005	Draft solicitation for industry comments

Fourth Quarter FY 2005	Pre-solicitation conference

First Quarter FY 2006		Final solicitation

Second Quarter FY 2006	Receive Proposals

Third Quarter FY 2006	Award/Begin Ramp-Up

Second Quarter FY 2007	Begin Phased-In Performance

           g.  Actions:  Draft requirements documents will be released to industry and the services for comment with notices published on FedBizOpps and on the DTCI website: www.doddtci.org.  The draft solicitation in its entirety will be posted for industry review prior to conducting a pre-solicitation conference and site visit at the DDSP Depot.  During this conference, a detailed briefing of the requirements will be presented, a site visit for offerors to facilitate an understanding of one of the most demanding and highly automated depot pick, pack and pull, operations, current transportation operations.  Also, a similar site visit will be arranged for a different date for offerors to observe operations of a less demanding and less automated depot for the purpose of providing prospective offerors with an opportunity to understand the diversity and volume of workload between the DoD highest volume depots and the lowest depots in the DLS system.  Instructions for proposal preparation will be discussed in conjunction with the source selection evaluation criteria leading to a best value contract award decision.  Specific instructions and information regarding the pre-solicitation conference will be provided as soon as the details are finalized.  Upon issuance of a final solicitation, a pre-proposal conference is anticipated as well.

<SUBJECT>A -- Malaria Vaccines:  Clinical Research and Trial Sites in Endemic Areas
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to expand the current contract HHSN266200400016C with the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research to include additional field sites under Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set fort in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities.  To help field sites prepare to conduct candidate malaria vaccine trials, the NIAID has provided support for malaria clinical research and trial site development in malaria endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa.  In addition, there are presently several field sites in Africa that have taken a multidisciplinary approach to malaria research, combining clinical, immunologic, genetic, entomologic, and other related studies.  The purpose of this contract is to further enhance the capacity of existing sites and to conduct in them the iterative phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials required to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of candidate malaria vaccines prior to licensure.  The NIAID has an urgent need to provide additional field site capacity to evaluate candidate malaria vaccines utilizing the multidisciplinary approach.  These field sites should be able to provide a population census of approximately 50 to 100 thousand individuals under demographic surveillance.  In addition, these field sites must be located in politically and socially stable parts of Africa, where travel by US government staff and their contractors would not be limited by security concerns.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting their interest and a capability statement demonstrating their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay or duplication of costs and effort.  See Government-Wide numbered notes 22 and 26.

For the last nine years the USPTO has used Accusoft Image Gear SDK to fulfill these requirements.  The current Accusoft SDK and distributable control files can be licensed for distribution on all media types used by USPTO.  Other products are not considered feasibel since it would take an estimated 6 month programming effort to develop, test and migrate our GUI using another SDK.  And the cost and time of that additional development would exceed and benefits that might be expected by migrating to another SDK.

The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the  trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, Gener al Support, and Depot maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE TWPS System:  1500 GPH Tactical Water Purification System (TWPS) 	Model Designator:  1500 GPH , TWPS,  XM102 System Description.  The TWPS NSN 4610-01-488-9656 is a modular designed system.  It is a mobile system designed to produce potable water at the rate of 1,200 to1,500 gallons per hour (GPH) from fresh, brackish, sea, and nuclear, biological, and chemical c ontaminated fresh water.  The Army  Tactical Water Purification System (A-TWPS) is configured within an 8- by 8- by 20-foot International Standards Organization-compatible platform transportable by the Palletized Load System (PLS) truck (M1074 and M1075),  heavy expanded mobility tactical truck (HEMTT) load handling system (LHS) truck (M1120), and PLS trailer (M1076) for transport. The A-TWPS is also configured with a 60-kilowatt (kW) tactical quiet generator (TQG), NSN 6115-01-274-7390, and a 15,000-gallon  water storage and distribution system. The TWPS core, its generator, all of its add-on modules, and five days of operating supplies are stored and transported in this LHS-compatible flatrack configuration.  The Marine Corps Tactical Water Purification Sys tem (MC-TWPS), NSN 4610-01-488-6961, core is produced in a non flatrack-mounted version for U.S. Marine Corps use.  Both configurations share a common skid that contains the reverse osmosis water purification equipment.  Both the A-TWPS and the MC-TWPS are complemented by five extended-capability modules.  These modules are included with the A-TWPS configuration.  The five extended capability modules are as follows: "	Cold-Weather Module.  This module consists of equipment necessary for severe-weather storage and operations below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   "	Supplemental Cleaning Waste and Storage Module.  This module (waste and storage module) is used to temporarily store the three cleaning waste streams. "	Ocean Intake Structure System (OISS) Module.  The OISS is deployed at beach locations exposed to wave action and ocean locations with significant tidal variations.  "	Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Water Treatment Module.  This module contains the items required to enable the TWPS to treat NBC-contaminated waters. "	NBC Survivability Module.  This module contains the items required to protect the TWPS from NBC contamination.  The purpose of the system is to purify any water source to make it potable so that it can be used for human consumption.  It accomplishes this by pumping the source water through an micro-filtration system then pumping the filtered water through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) element.  A high pressure, 1200 psi, pump is required to pump the filtered water through the RO element.  The potable water produced is pumpe d into a series of five (5) 3000 gallon fabric storage tanks.  Each storage tank is about 11 foot in diameter and when full stands about 5 feet off of the ground.  When purifying fresh or brackish water, the LWP can produce 1500 U.S. gallons of potable wat er every hour.  When purifying salt or sea water, the LWP can produce 1200 U.S. gallons of potable water every hour.  The LWP can maintain these production rates for water that contains up to 60,000 Total Dissolved Solids (TDS).  A chemical injection pump is used to add chlorine into the product water for storage.   Operational Mode Summary (OMS). a.  Operational Concept.  The TWPS will be used to purify raw water from any source (ground or surface) for human consumption.  The concept of operation is to produce water as far forward as possible, using a flexible and mobile treatment system during war - and operations other than war scenarios.  The governing parameters are the number of personnel for which support is required, and the climatic conditions in which it will be employed.  The system will be mobile, compatible with ground, amphibious, air mo bile, and airborne units.  The system will be stored, transported, and operated in the basic and hot (-28 degrees to 160 degrees °F) climate (see AR 70-38). b.  Wartime. (1) The TWPS will be employed throughout the division area as a direct support asset.  Existing doctrine (i.e. supply point distribution) projects up to five separate water production locations in the division area.  The support battalion (main support bat talion and supply and transportation) will employ the TWPS throughout the division and brigade support areas at locations where acceptable water supplies exist.  The TWPS will produce water that will be: distributed at the point of production; line-hauled to forward supply points; and/or line-hauled to major consumers (e.g., hospitals).  The anticipated duration for wartime missions is three months to one year.  The mission profile will generally consist of 85 percent operation under the conditions describe d for Situation 1 and 15 percent operation under conditions described for Situation 2 (see Table 2). 2)  Threat Matrix. Table 1.  Threat Matrix for TWPS Threat	Indirect Strike	Direct Strike Artillery	X	 Rockets	X	 Bombs		X Nuclear	X	 Biological	X	X Chemical	X	X Sabotage		X Raids	X	 Other Theater Area    Attack Weapons	X c.  Peacetime.  The TWPS will be deployed in support of field training exercises and operated in the same manner as prescribed in the operational concept and wartime OMS.  Additionally, the TWPS will be used to support operations other than war (e.g., disa ster relief, humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping missions, etc.) using the operational concept tailored to the situation needs.  The anticipated duration for peacetime missions is two weeks (field training exercises) and up to one year for operations ot her than war.  The mission profile will generally consist of 95 percent operation under the conditions described for Situation 1 and 5 percent operation under conditions described for Situation 2 (see Table 2). Mission Profile (MP). a.  Table 2 describes the operation of the TWPS and the tasks required during normal operation. Table 2.  Mission Profile for 1,500-GPH ROWPU Task	Situation 1*: (hrs)	Situation 2§ (hrs) Produce Potable Water	20 	15 Backwash Filters @ Maintenance	4 	4 Tear Down	0	2 Relocate	0	1 Set up	0	2 	*	Continuous operations during 24-hour period. 	**	Operation with one relocation during at 24-hour period.  	***	Includes operator checks and services conducted during a 12-hour shift. b.  The production rate of the TWPS will vary based on the type of raw water source as shown in Table 3.  The production rate is also affected by the specific physical characteristics of the raw water quality (e.g., temperature, TDS, etc.). Table 3. TWPS Mission Profile Based on Source Water Quality   Type of Source Water 	Frequen cy of Operation	Production Profile !(GPH) Fresh Water	75%	1,500 Sea Water	25%	1,200    Average water quality characteristics defined in paragraph 5, below. !  Average normalized hourly flow rate during operation (15 or 20 hours) in a 24-hour period.  Potable water quality and sampling in accordance with frequency (minimum sampling 1x4 hours operation) and proposed Tri-Service standards for TB MED 577  Environmental Conditions.  Tables 4 and 5 show the anticipated operating climate conditions and movement terrain for the TWPS, respectively. Table 4.  Operating Climatic Conditions   Climate Conditions	% of Fleet Hot	10 Basic	90 Table 5.  Movement Terrain Conditions   Terrain	Usage Improved Roads	50% Unimproved Roads	30% Cross Country	20% Methodologies and References for OMS/MP. a.  For the purpose of defining the production profile, a fresh water source is defined as having less than 1,000 mg/L TDS.  This definition is consistent with the Tri-Service Water Quality Standards for potable water.  For the purpose of defining the prod uction profile, sea water source is defined as any water source with a TDS greater than 15,001 mg/L.  Additionally, all waters are normalized to the average concentration at 77 degrees Fahrenheit. b.  The treated water quality profile is based on the proposed Tri-Service standards for long-term (greater than one year) exposure. OEM:  SFA, Inc, Frederick Manufacturing Division, 20 S. Wisner St., Frederick MD 21701 Availability of TDP: The Army does not own the TDP, the system PM PAWS procured the TWPS according to PD ATPD 2219, Dated 15 Jan 06. Also, the Army procured a support drawing packaged for the TWPS (not a completed TDP). Configuration  Stability.  System configuration is frozen the TWPS is in full rate production. Fleet Assessment.  The TWPS is a new system currently in Full Rate Production.  Currently there are 20 systems fielded to units.  A total of 53 TWPS will be fielded during FY06.  Thereafter, a total of 20 additional systems will be procured and fielded in FY07-FY08. Reliability  Mean Time Between Essential Function Failure (MTBEFF):  Estimated at 120 hrs MTBEFF Depot Capability  Current Workload:  None Current Organic Support:   1.  Supply and Logistics Support: Support objectives for initial operational capability is full organic support and compatible with the current structure in place Supply support requirements were generated from a detailed analysis of maintenance tasks that identified all resources required for system support.  Provisioning Technical Documentation was used for the identification, selection, determination of initial r equirements, and cataloging of support items to be procured through the provisioning process.  The TWPS IPT reviewed and approved the Spare Parts List and the Long Lead Time Item List.  The Provisioning Data permits NSN assignment, as required, and the pro curement and stockage of high-demand items. Initial spares (Authorized Stockage List [ASL] is provided to gaining units and funded by PM PAWS.  Replenishment spares will be stocked according to demand, funded and requisitioned by the using activity. 2.  Maintenance Concepts:  The procurement utilized organic logistical support for the maintenance and servicing of the TWPS and conforms to the requirements and guidance IAW AR 750-1 (Army Materiel Maintenance Policy) and DA PAM 738-750 (Functional Users Manual for The Army Maintenance Management System [TAMMS]). Maintenance will correspond to the Two-Level Maintenance System concept (Field and Sustainment).  It is the Program Managers intent to transition to the two level maintenance concepts in FY07.  Current manuals will transition from four-level maintenance to  support two-level maintenance at the field and sustainment levels. Field includes operator preventative maintenance (C), unit maintenance (O) and some direct support maintenance (F).  Sustainment will also include some  direct support maintenance as well as all general support maintenance (H).  Field and Sustainment maintenance will be preformed using standard tools, test, measurement and diagnostic equipment.  No depot support is envisioned for the TWPS.  A Preventative  Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) and a Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) are included in the system technical manual. The TWPSs has an operational reliability of 120 hours mean time between essential function failure (MTBEFF), a mean time to repair (MTTR) no greater than one hour for all unscheduled maintenance demands (UMD), and a maximum time to repair (MaxTTR) no grea ter than two hours for 90 percent of all essential unscheduled maintenance demands (EUMD).   3. Training and Training Devices:  The Materiel Developer will provide a complete training package that will support all phases of training for the TWPS.  The Training Support Package (TSP) was developed to support New Equipment (NET), Institutional and Su stainment Training.  The system TSP is designed and developed IAW U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 350-70 within the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) database.  The TWPS system TSP includes electronic technical manua ls (ETM), program of instruction, lesson plans, student and instructor guides and an instructional DTV (Distributive Training Vehicle) Web-based interactive multimedia package on the operation and maintenance of the TWPS.  The DTV will be provided for use in sustainment training and to facilitate distance learning.    Instructor and key personnel training (I&KPT) was provided for the initial transfer of information and training methods from the materiel developer to the trainer.  Distance learning is also b eing considered as a method of providing NET. The first production TWPS was provided to the Quartermaster and Ordnance Maintenance Mechanical Schools for use in institutional training.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to award Sole Source contract action with the University of Vermont for Plasma Tissue Factor immunoassay
<DESC>The University of Vermont has developed an immunoassay by which plasma tissue factor (TF) concentration can be measured simultaneously with non-specific binding in a single reaction well and where the reference standard curves are generated by spikin g recombinant TF (rTF) in TF  immunodepleted plasma (NIH Project Grant No.HL 46703;unpublished data). These assays are highly specific and reproducible. Their immunoassay  detects full length TF (1-263), truncated TF ( 1-218) and (1-242) as well as monocy te and placenta expressed TF. It utilizes anti-TF monoclonal antibody (mAb) clone 5 for capturing and detection of TF. This binding is then detected using a biotinylated probe, anti-TF mAb clone 48 and phycoerythrin-streptavidin. The mAb is produced and ch aracterized in the Antibody Core Facility at the University of Vermont and is not commercially available.

The Government anticipates making an award to a minimum of four (4) up to a maximum of seven (7) [ of which at least one will be a SDVOSB (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business)].  It is the Government's intent to establish terms and conditions to effect repairs and alterations to provide prompt services on an as needed basis at minimum administrative costs and that the work will be performed in an expeditious and efficient manner within the budgetary limitations and performance time established for each delivery order.  This project includes but is not limited to the following work:  Demolition; Furnish and Install (Ceilings, Windows, Doors, Hardware, and partitions, Carpeting, Floor Tile and Insulation), Specialties (Fire Protection System); Mechanical; and Electrical.

Point of Contact: Michelle T. Holland, Contract Specialist at 215-446-4686. The Contracting Officer for this project is Bob Waring. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED!! 

This solicitation will be issued as full and open negotiated procurement with Source Selection procedures.  The selection of contractors will be pursuant to the best value concept.  All proposals received under this Request for Proposals will individually be ranked based on technical and price proposals submitted in comparison to the evaluation criteria listed below.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of technical capability and price.  (For this procurement, demonstrated technical capability is more important than price).  AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS.

The evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance.  FAILURE TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED EVIDENCE AND / OR RELATED INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY GSA WILL RESULT IN A FINDING OF NON-RESPONSIBILITY AS DEFINED BY FAR PART 9.    

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS

Factor A: Experience and Qualifications - Past performance and experience on similar projects:  

Offerors are requested to demonstrate their construction experience in fully occupied office facilities by providing a list of five successful projects completed within the past five years, similar in dollar value, similar in nature, and similar working conditions as those anticipated in this contract. (The range of construction costs of the five projects should be between $2,000 and $25,000).  The list shall not exceed five pages.  

At least three of the five projects must be between $10,000 and $15,000, and one of the projects must be over $20,000.  Discuss the firm’s experience in handling such projects simultaneously.  Experience with managing multiple, simultaneous projects is considered an asset.  Offerors are required to provide the following information for each project submitted  (limit each project to one page).  

For the evaluation of this criterion, the firm is required to provide the following (limited to a maximum of five pages):
 
~  Name and location of the project
~  A description of the project 
~  Award amount and the final cost at construction completion 
~  Actual work the firm performed 
~  Owner’s name, telephone number, address, and person to contact
~  For each project listed, provide the number of other projects, dollar values, and a brief description of the projects which were performed concurrently with that project 

Board members will evaluate past performance by contacting references provided and discussing the offerors performance on the listed projects, addressing workmanship, timeliness, cost control, and technical success of the project.  The Board may also choose additional methods to evaluate past performance, such as visiting the site of the completed projects, Contractor Performance System (CPS), etc.  

Factor B:  Key Personnel Qualifications:  

Identify key personnel for the project team for orders to be placed under this contract and list their responsibilities, qualifications, and positions for the proposed projects.  Complete resumes for key personnel shall be provided for each member proposed to work on this contract and should list their education, training, qualifications, and experience relative to the tasks they will be performing (limited to four pages).  Include professional qualifications, specialized experience in this type of work and the technical competence of the staff on similar projects.  The government desires that key personnel have five or more years of construction renovation experience in occupied facilities.  Demonstrate that the project team has the ability to provide mechanical, architectural, electrical, and plumbing renovations in occupied buildings.  Offerors are required to discuss previous experience that the proposed key personnel may have in working together on past projects.  

Factor C:  Technical and Organizational Approach: 

1.  Offerors are required to present the resource allocation for handling construction orders simultaneously.  Discuss the firm’s technical and organizational abilities for performing projects in fully occupied facilities for projects costing between $2,000 and $25,000.  The discussions should include the team’s proposed organizational approach in addressing the management of construction projects simultaneously.  Describe how project phasing is managed.  In addition, describe how the construction performed under this will be managed and what methods will be employed to ensure timely and satisfactory completion of projects.  Use examples where appropriate.  Include a discussion of how the work will be accomplished regarding subcontractors and in-house staff.  Contractor’s employing an in-house staff is considered an asset.  

2.  If subcontracting is anticipated, include a list of proposed subcontractors and discuss their construction project experience.  Established, ongoing subcontractor relationship is considered to be an asset.  

PRICE PROPOSALS:

Past performance, personnel qualifications and technical qualifications are deemed to be the most important elements since GSA is seeking firms who will complete projects successfully and with the best workmanship.  The price is considered to be of importance, but not as important as the other three factors, since the overall goal is to acquire firms possessing technical expertise with sound professional backgrounds.  Source Selection Procedures require price to be a related factor, and award will be based on a combination of all four factors (Price becomes more important when the difference in technical scores is insignificant.)

Each offeror must submit unit prices for all items listed on Attachment A to the Standard Form 1442 for work to be performed during normal working hours for the base year of the contract.  The contractor shall also propose a multiplier percentage factor for After Hour Work for the Base Year; multiplier percentage factor for each of the four Option Years; a multiplier percentage factor for After Hour work for each of the four Option Years; and a multiplier percentage factor for travel.  

A multiplier percentage factor may be reflected as a plus, a minus, or "net".  For example, a percentage factor of plus 10 percent should be reflected as (+10%); a percentage factor of minus 10 percent should be reflected as (-10%).  Submitting the word "net" means the proposer will accept all line item prices as they are stated without any percent change.

NOTE: This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. The Bidder / Offeror must submit the attached DOCUMENT SECURITY FORM signed by the bidder / offeror. The document requires a copy of the business license, a DUNS Number and a IRS TAX ID Number.

The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and (b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and (c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, (d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

	B. Factor 2: Professional Qualifications: 

1. Offerors shall submit a statement of qualifications outlining their firm’s 
capabilities and experience with respect to the effort described herein. The statement of qualifications should describe the personnel and their experience that are directly relevant to this effort. Resumes of proposed personnel shall be submitted with the proposal. Professional staff resumes are not included in the 25-page limitation, but are themselves limited to 3 pages.

		2. Basis of Evaluation: The resumes submitted by the offeror will be evaluated to assess the availability and qualifications of the proposed staff, their experience in similar projects and their capability to fully and professionally accomplish the objectives stated herein. 
	
C. Factor 3: Past Performance: 

1. Offerors must submit descriptions of projects similar in scope, size and
complexity performed during the past three years, including references. Sufficient information should be provided to allow the Government to contact the agencies/organizations served and assess the quality of the services provided. References should be of those individuals the most knowledgeable of the offerors’ past performance and contact information for those references must be accurate and current.

2. Basis of Evaluation: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the performance 
of the offeror with respect to projects similar in scope, size, complexity and relevant subject matter expertise to the work described herein as well as the quality of performance provided under those projects.

	D. Factor 4: Price: Not objectively rated, but considered for reasonableness in the best value determination
    
3.	ADJECTIVAL RATING AND STANDARDS SCALE
Each proposal will be rated based on evaluation of each factor using the following Adjectival Rating and Standards Scale:

OUTSTANDING – Very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear response. Proposal consistently meets this standard with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.

EXCELLENT – Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality, but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.

GOOD – No deficiencies in the response. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

FAIR – The response generally meets requirements but there is not expectation of better than acceptable performance. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

POOR – The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revisions to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.

UNACCEPTABLE – Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

4.	BEST VALUE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY:

Best value evaluations is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solution that provides the optimal results to the Government, price and other factors considered, Subjectivity is inherent in the process and is the cornerstone of the source selection decision. In an effort to provide insight to the offerors as to the decision making process of the Government, the following information is provided:

Evaluation will be made on two factors – Technical and Price. In the evaluation, technical is significantly more important than price. While price is not as important as Technical, it does have significance to the Government.

In rating the technical proposals, the three factors (Technical Understanding, Professional Qualifications, and Past Performance) are listed in descending order of importance. Technical Understanding is moderately more important than the other two factors combined while Professional Qualifications is slightly more important then Past Performance/Corporate Experience.

Your firm’s submission should reflect and demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered. Resumes and qualifications of proposed personnel shall also be provided. Your submission should reflect the quality and experience of proposed personnel at competitive fixed prices. The technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages in length and single sided. The technical proposal shall include labor mix and hours, but not labor rates. During the technical evaluation, the labor mix and hours, not labor rates, will be evaluated. Price submissions shall be under separate cover and competitive firm fixed priced. Other Direct Costs proposed shall be realistic to the extent that all costs/prices can be fully supported. Resumes, and past performance do not count towards the page limitation. Email is the preferred method of submission.

6. BACKGROUND
WHS/ITMD currently has two Hewlett-Packard servers.  One is a production server and the other is a development server.  These servers have reached their end of life cycle and need to be replaced.  

Production Database Server

The production environment consists of one HP 9000 N400 (N Class) server primarily running HP-UX 11.0 with Oracle 8.1.7 databases that support a variety of custom applications as well as COTS products such as RESUMIX, Business Objects, and TrackIt.

Hardware Platform:  The current server configuration for the N Class server is as follows: two 36 GB internal disks, eight 36 GB Surestore disks, DVD ROM, two Single Port Ultra 2 SCSI HBA’s, three 800 MHz processors, 4 GB of RAM, one 100Base-T LAN adapter, one DDS3 DAT tape drive, rack mounted HP PowerTrust II-MR 4 kW (4.5 kVA) UPS 240v, which are installed in two HP9000 Standard Rack System E41.  The current operating system installed on the server is HP-UX 11.0 with an unlimited user’s license and is not clustered.  

Software Platform:
The HP-UX development environment consists of Oracle 8.1.7 and 9.x.  Backups are performed by CommVault Galaxy version 5.9.0.

Current Usage:  200 GBs of local storage to support the databases with an anticipated increase next year of 400 GBs.  Furthermore, the government anticipates a growth rate of 15 percent per year after FY07.  There four Oracle database instances which serve 36 concurrent users.  On average there are 100 sessions active at any given time with a peak of 200.   

Development Database Server

The development environment mirrors the production environment as stated above.

Production Web Server

Hardware:  The production web server is a Sun Fire 280R that has two 900 MHz processors, 4 GBs RAM, and two 72 GB internal hard drives.  It is running SUN Solaris 8.0.

Software:  Apache 1.3.31, Oracle Client 9.2, CommVault Galaxy version 5.9 (client), OpenSSL 0.9.7i, OpenSSH 4.2p1, mod_perl 1.0, mod_ssl 2.8.25 and later.
 
Current Usage:  60 GB of disk space is currently being consumed.  This server houses a publicly accessible web site that receives approximately 25 K hits per day.  The present server meets the current usage requirement.  However, the government anticipates a 10 % increase each year after FY07.

7.	REQUIREMENTS

<DESC>Amend combined solicitation/synopsis number W91ZLK-06-T-0219 to include the following requirements:  Item - Mass spectrometer detectors, vapor sampling tubes, thermal desorption devices as a total analytical package for the Agent Fate DTO. Equipment Requirements - Five new wind tunnels are currently being constructed and characterized for use by the Agent Fate Program. The Agent Fate Program requires analytical equipment to analyze the vapor collected from the tunnel IAW the Agent Fate progr am DTO. The equipment requirements include:  1) Must include delivery, installation, setup, one year warranty, and familiarization of the systems. All equipment must be capable of operating on a standard 120 V power system. All equipment must be supplied f rom a single vendor. 2) Rapid quote turn-around, due to the high-priority and time-sensitivity of the program. 3)  A quantity of vapor sampling tubes to meet the analytical throughput of the 6 wind tunnels. 4)  A vapor tube auto-sampler capable of holding 100 tubes at one time for high-throughput. 5)  Serve as a detector for all chemical agents. 6)  Identical in performance to current analytical capital for direct data comparison between all wind tunnels. 7)  A complete and integrated analytical package with complete compatibility with the existing systems and capital. 8)  The mass spectrometer must be able to scan from 2-800 amu in 0.1 amu steps at scan speeds up to 5200 amu/sec. 9)  The quadrupole mass fi lter must consist of a one-piece gold-plated quartz hyperbolic filter with the faces permanently aligned. 10)  The quadrupole temperature shall be user selectable between 100 and 200 degrees C. 11)  The Ionization current shall be selectable over the range  0-315 microamperes. 12)  The Ion source temperature shall be selectable between 100 and 250 degrees C. 13)  The GC-MS interface temperature shall be selectable between 100 and 320 degrees C. 14)  The mass axis stability shall be +/- 0.15 amu per 12 hour t ime period. 15)  The capillary direct interface must be short to provide better sensitivity and less sample degradation. 16)  The dynamic range of the instrument must be over 6 orders of magnitude. 17)  The linear dynamic range shall be over 4 orders of ma gnitude. 18)  Sensitivity: Electron Impact, Scan Mode - 1 pg of octafluoranapthalene in 1 uL iso-octane injected in pulsed splitless mode onto a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 um 5% phenyl methyl silicone column, with data acquired at 2.9 cycles/second across a mas s range of 50-300 amu, shall yield an RMS signal/noise of at least 20:1 for the extracted ion signal at m/z 272. 19)  Sensitivity: Electron Impact, selected Ion Monitoring (SIM)-20 fg of octafluoronapthalene injected in 1 uL of iso-octane onto a 30 m x 0.2 5 mm x 0.25 um 5% phenyl methyl silicone column, with data acquired at 1.9 cycles/second and a dwell time of 500 ms, shall yield an RMS signal/nolse of at least 10:1 for the extracted ion signal at m/z 272. 20)  GC must utilize Swagelok fittings for all ga s lines. Oven temperature range from 4 degrees C above ambient temperature to 450 degrees C, allowing for optimal splitless inlet sampling procedures for trace analysis. 21)  Electronic Pneumatic Control should adjust for atmospheric pressure and ambient t emperature changes in real time to provide the highest precision in analyte retention time. 22)  Built-in and permanently calibrated barometer and thermometer to compensate far ambient laboratory changes for maximum reproducibility. 23)  Injectors and dete ctors must be modular to permit exchange in 5 minutes. 24)  Able to control two detectors simultaneously with the mass spectrometer. 25)  System must automatically shut off gases in the event of a leak. 26)  The retention time must be reproducible to within 0.007 minutes using n-decane. 27)  Stability over 72 hours varies less than 0.060 psi. 20)  Should have LAN and RS-232 interfaces and two analog output ports. 29)  Must have 6 ramp and 7 plateau oven temperature pro gramming flexibility. 30)  Oven temperature range: Ambient + 4 degrees C to 450 degrees C without cryo, to -80 degrees C with cryo. 31)  Must have power fall memory protection. 32)  GC must control 7 heated zones: 1 oven, 2 injectors, 2 detectors, and 2 au xiliary. 33)  Must have built-in diagnostics and comprehensive self tests. 34)  Must have a built in control for an autosampler.  All other information contained in the combined synopsis/solicitation including the response date remains the same.
