<DESC>NA DESC:  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of a 6.2 Research & Development Program as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth  herein.  This Research Announcement (RA) constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION: The Army is anticipating the  development of new centerline turboshaft engines for use in future manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of the Objective Force (i.e., UCAR, Future Combat System). These engines will be developed under the DoD/NASA DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Tu rbine Engine (VAATE) initiative.  The Small Affordable Turbine Engine (SATE) program will be conducted under the VAATE initiative and will demonstrate progress towards the VAATE phase II turboshaft/turboprop goals beginning in the FY08 timeframe. The SATE program goals will be to demonstrate a 25% reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), a 80% increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a 35% reduction in production and maintenance cost and a design life of 5000 hrs in a 1000 hp class (800-1200 hp) t urboshaft engine.  In order to meet the aggressive goals of the SATE program, significant advancements in turbine engine mechanical systems technology will be required. The mechanical systems and associated accessory drives account for close to 15% of a mo dern turboshaft engineÃ¢Â€Â™s weight and are currently responsible for a significant percentage of unscheduled engine removals.  The aggressive performance goals of the SATE engine dictates the need for increased rotational speeds, temperatures, and pressu res. These conditions create significant challenges for the mechanical components. Achieving mechanical component durability and damage tolerance is one of the major challenges created by the higher rotational speeds and the resulting centrifugal forces. T he increased cycle temperatures and pressures also create a severe thermal environment for the bearings, seals and lubrication system. Managing/tolerating this thermal environment with minimal weight and performance penalties to the total engine will be in creasingly difficult. Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop advanced turbine engine mechanical systems technologies that possess the combination of performance, durability, and affordability necessary to enable SATE technology level t urboshaft engines to achieve their performance and cost goals.   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: It is the Government's desire to conduct a technology development effort focused on advanced mechanical systems technologies for SATE technology level turboshaft engine s. The program shall utilize a notional SATE turboshaft engine design to establish the operational requirements and potential payoffs of the proposed concepts relative to the SATE engine performance, durability and cost objectives. The desired end result o f the program is the validation testing of the technology in a laboratory environment (TRL = 4) under conditions representative of the environment of the notional SATE engine. The notional SATE engine should be designed to achieve the following characteris tics:  less than or equal to 0.42 specific fuel consumption (based on 1000 SHP engine @ SLS, IRP):  greater than or equal to  5.5 Horsepower to Weight ratio (without reduction gearbox):  less than or equal to $235k per engine production cost (including bas ic HMU or FADEC control system):  Design Life of 5000 hours.  The Advanced Turbine Engine Mechanical Systems Technology program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE initiative.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (A TPP) will eventually be required for any successful offerors, such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this announcement.    ANTI CIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated period of performance is 40 months total with 37 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. Government Estimate: Government Share = $675,000 (Dis tribution: FY04; 30%, FY05; 30%, FY06 30%, FY07 10%).    Proposals must follow the guidelines described in this solicitation.  TYPE OF CONTRACT:  The Government anticipates an award of a Technology Investment Agreement (Cooperative Agreement (10 U.S.C. 235 8) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) with up to 50% cost share.

Recipient shall submit a regular and reproducible Final Report within 30 calendar days of receipt of annotated draft. The report shall contain a detailed description of all technical effort performed under this Agreement and results to include conclusions drawn and recommendations.  EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD:  The selection for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in  accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop  an order of merit listing for proposals submitted under this announcement.  Proposed cost will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  Th e evaluation criteria are:  (1)  The extent to which the proposed work satisfies the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s research need by use of innovative, creative, efficient, and affordable approaches to the technical objectives.  (2)  The merit of the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives.  (3)  The experience and qualifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and other proposed personnel.  (4)  The suitability and availability of proposed facilities.  (5)  Realism of  the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort.  Proposed costs must reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and be reasonable & consistent with the various elements of the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s technical proposal.  Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  Proposed cost to the Government is a review criterion.  The amount of cost sharing percentage could res ult in greater evaluation credit.  Technical merit is the paramount evaluation criteria.  Note:  In applying the above criteria, the relative weighting of engine level goals is specific fuel consumption, horsepower to weight, and life being weighted signif icantly higher than, production, and maintenance cost.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  All work performed under Agreement(s) resulting from this RA will be unclassified and will not require access to classified material.  A determination has been made that perfor mance under the agreement(s) will require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U. S. C., Sec. 2751 et. Seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award, the successful firm( s) will be required to provide an Ã¢Â€ÂœExport-Controlled DoD Data AgreementÃ¢Â€Â certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FBA Federa l Ctr., Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.

<DESC>NA This project consists of the repair of a scour hole that has developed between Ditch 66 and Ditch 1 Lower, between STA-18+00 and STA 32+00 in Dunklin County, Missouri.  The project site is east of Kennett, Missouri and north of Missouri Highway 84.  A scou r area developed between two the parallel ditches, which are maintained by separate local entities.  This intermingling of waters has caused problems and likely will have harmful ramifications if left uncorrected.  Within the project site, there is an exis ting abandoned railroad bridge that crosses the scour location.  The bridge will be removed under this project.  Repair of the scour hole consists of installation of fill material in the scour hole and placement of bedding material and riprap overtop of th e fill material.

Fill material will be obtained from existing excess material banks upstream and downstream (within 2,500 feet) of the scour hole.  Material from the excess material banks will be degraded to a lower limit of 267.0 feet NGVD29.  Access to the project will be from Highway 84, approximately 1.5 miles downstream of the project.  Environmental protection should be used throughout construction.  Before project completion, the turf should be established.  The estimated value of the proposed work is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  There are six (6) sheets in the set of drawings. This will be an unrestricted procuremen t. To qualify as a Small Business Concern, the Concern must have had average annual sales receipt for the preceding three Fiscal Years not exceeding $28.5 million.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to BAE, Nashua NH for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items within the Federal Stock Class 5895 that are determined to be sole source to BAE.  Other sole source items outside of FSC 5895 will be included if considered necessary for weapon system integrity.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated for three years with the inclusion of options to extend the contract to a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance will be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number.

MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, at 478-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

The service laterals selected will be rehabilitated by removal and replacement of the existing pipe or installation of cured-in-place pipe.  Some select buildings will receive double cleanouts placed five feet outside of the building.  The estimated performance period is approximately 180 calendar days.

<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to six Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award fewer than six contracts if sufficient number of acceptable proposals are not submitted to make awards.  The Government may consider volume of work under these contracts when requesting bids for new projects in order to affect an equitable distribution of work.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT EXCHANGES OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  The work will consist of new HVAC/Mechanical projects with associated electrical work and incidental related work at Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina.  The work will include demolition, repair, replacement, extension and modification of HVAC/Mechanical systems, steam and condensate lines, minor boiler repair, plumbing, piping, motors, controls, and incidental related work, including but not limited to, painting, asbestos/lead paint abatement, architectural modifications, and related electrical work.  Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), up to six contractors, will compete for task orders based on best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  Each contract will be for one base year with four one-year options.  The total 5-year (base year and four option years) not-to-exceed amount for each contract is $30,000,000.00.  Each contract has an annual value not to exceed $6,000,000.00.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The six best value contractors will be selected for the award of either the seed project or the award of one of the six contracts with a minimum guarantee of $10,000.00 to each successful offeror over the full term of the contract to include the option years.  The first IDIQ construction contract of the six will be awarded with a firm-fixed price, 100% design as the seed project.  This is a RFP, which requires submission of technical and price proposals.  Evaluation of award will be based on technical factors including (A) Past Performance, (B) Management and Organization, and (C) Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Businesses.  Management and Organization has subfactors which are:  (1) Corporate Experience, (2) Quality Control and Key Personnel, (3) Safety and Health, and (4) Bonding Capability for projects of size and nature envisioned.  Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Businesses has subfactors (1) Small Business Past Performance, and (2) Subcontracting Plan Effort.  It will also be based on pricing full plans and specifications for the seed project, N62470-03-D-0856, Alterations to Compressor Systems, Phase I, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina, which has an estimated cost range of $100,000.00 to $250,000.00.  The work includes, in general terms, the installation of compressed air desiccant dryers, receiver tank, interconnecting piping, and incidental related work, and the removal of abandoned air compressors, air dryers, interconnecting piping and electrical systems, and incidental related work.  The Best Value Contractor of the six IDIQ contracts will be awarded the seed project with the initial award.  All six contractors will compete on subsequent task orders.  These subsequent projects will be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design.  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, however, pricing will be weighted heavily.  The awarded task order will be a firm-fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth IDIQ Contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award considerations may be modified in order to ensure each participating Contractor is awarded task orders meeting the minimum guarantee.  All initial awarded Contractors will be required to participate in all MACC walk-throughs, if required, and submit proposals.  Failure to participate responsibly in walk-throughs and failure to submit proposals on task orders may result in the Government not issuing additional task orders or exercising the option to extend the contract for an additional year.  The contract will be awarded to the best value offeror in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 15.  Only the six selected Contractors will be permitted to propose on the task orders.  Proposals from another Contractor will not be accepted.  A minimum of two proposals will satisfy the competitive requirements of MACC and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the proposers is not able to participate in the process.  Failure to participate in the task order process may result in forfeiture of the minimum guarantee amount.  Seed project is unrestricted with a NAICS of 238220 and size standard of $12,000,000.  No public bid opening will be held.  A subcontracting plan is required, if the contract is awarded to a large business.  Plans and specifications will be available on or about 28 July 2003.  The estimated date for receipt of offers is on or about 28 August 2003.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD), Ann Arbor, MI, for the period September 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004.  The purpose of this order is to obtain the services of SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow to serve as part of OBSSR staff to provide greater interaction between the developmental research community and federal research programs and policies.  Following a two-week science policy orientation program at American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Fellows work as resident scholars in a federal agency that sponsors developmental research, providing advice and guidance to programs, and working in partnership with research teams within the federal government.  The SRCD was founded in 1933 to advance research in child development, to foster an interdisciplinary consideration of substantive and methodological problems in the field of child development, and to encourage applications of research findings.  The Society publishes two journals, a newsletter, a membership directory, and a social policy report; holds biennial meetings in March or April of odd-numbered years; sponsors conferences; and supports a Washington, DC-based policy and communications office.  Its membership of more than 5,600 is representative of the various disciplines and professions that contribute to knowledge of child development.  Under the guidance of the Committee on Policy and Communications, the Society helps to bring the results of research to bear on the formulation of policy affecting children and families.  One way this is done is through the Society for Research in Child Development Policy Fellowships.  Since 1978, SRCD has recruited and facilitated the placement of more than 60 AAAS congressional and (since 1991) executive branch fellows.  The goals of these fellowships are to contribute to the effective use of scientific knowledge in developing public policy, to educate the scientific community about the development of public policy, and to establish a more effective liaison between scientists and the federal policy-making mechanisms.  The Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) is the only organization that can provide an SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow on September 1, 2003 as required by OBSSR.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the American Psychological Association, Washington, DC.
Purpose:
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in partnership with States to improve prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders.  With the national shift to managed care delivery systems, SAMHSA is focusing resources to work with States, counties, community providers, family members and consumers to ensure effective, comprehensive and nondiscriminatory mental health and substance abuse managed care services.  

The responsibilities assigned to CMHS by the PHS Act include evaluating the organization and financing of care of mental health service systems.  The Office of the Associate Director for Organization and Financing (ADOF) serves as the Center’s lead for the direction and coordination of activities involving the organization and financing of mental health services, including managed care.  These activities include data collection and analysis, cost estimation, services evaluation, cost-effectiveness analysis, policy assessment, and technical assistance.  In addition, ADOF handles projects and activities assigned to CMHS under the SAMHSA managed care initiative and coordinates managed care activities within CMHS.

A particular need for ADOF related to these areas is to identify information needs of MH providers and to effectively disseminate information that it develops to such providers.
												

The primary purpose of requirement is to provide technical assistance and educational materials concerning ADOF and SAMHSA-generated information on mental health services to the membership of the American Psychological Association (APA).  Since it is the membership of APA that is the target of these activities, APA is the appropriate choice to ensure that these activities do not duplicate related efforts and that materials and training are coordinated with other services that APA provides for its membership. 

 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a nine  (9) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was established with the 1992 ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public law 102-321).  Congress created SAMHSA/ CMHS to bring new hope to adults who have severe mental illnesses and to children with serious emotional disturbances.  SAMHSA/CMHS leads Federal efforts to promote mental health and prevent the development or worsening of mental illnesses whenever possible.   

The people most affected by the work of SAMHSA/CMHS’ Special Programs Development Branch (SPDB) include some of the Nation’s most under-served and at-risk populations such as racial/ethnic minorities, women, and young children, adolescents, and their families.  The Branch’s programs focus on special and emerging mental health issues for individuals and their families.  

Three major grant programs are under the Special Programs Development Branch’s (SPDB’s) broad domain to Promote Mental Health and Prevent Mental and Behavioral Disorders.  Of these, the largest grant program is the interdepartmental Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) School Violence Prevention Initiative designed to prevent school violence and promote healthy child and adolescent development.  This initiative is administered collaboratively by the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Education (DoED), and Health and Human Development(DHHS). SPDB has the lead for DHHS.

Since the beginning of the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, SPDB understood the significant challenges facing school districts as they implemented a complex grant program requiring the integration of educational, mental health and law strategies into a comprehensive program. 

Formalized technical assistance that could complement the efforts of Government Project Officers from the three agencies was identified as an important component of the school violence prevention initiative. A grant announcement was release in 1999 that called for the creation of a technical assistance center to provide substantive guidance and interpersonal support to the Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) grantees. A wide range of technical assistance (TA) issues were to be addresses such as: (a) helping community coalitions remain strong, (b) brokering national expert to visit sites, (c) creating a customized technical assistance plan for each site through a collaborative process, and (d) helping the grantee develop strategies to sustain important aspects of their grant program after Federal funds end.


The National Mental Health Association in partnership with the National Association of School Psychologist was awarded the technical assistgance grant in September, 1999. The TA center became know as the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Action Center (Action Center).

A recent focus of the Action Center’s work has been on the issue of sustaining community programs and services after Federal financial assistance ends. The Action Center recognizes that not only must the grantee address the complex issues of reducing youth violence, but they must make an heroic effort to affect the culture of the school and change the ongoing governance and policy structures that can support and sustain reform.  All of this information and work in the area of sustaining resources after Federal dollars leave, needs to be organized and packaged in such a way that it can be shared with all of the SS/HS grantees and other CMHS Grantees as well.  This contract provides NMHA with the resources to compile this information and create a Tool Kit, and summary report that can be shared beyond the boundaries of SS/HS.  The Took is to include but not limited to the following topics:  effective governance, change agency functions, leadership, institutionalized mechanism, capacity building, public/private partnerships and accountability, a description of the process of TA with a discussion of lessons learn about all issues related to sustainability 

This project supports SAMHSA’s Science to Service Initiative in the SAMHSA Priority Area: Prevention  & Early Intervention.  It embodies SAMHSA’s Cross-Cutting Principle of collaboration with public and private partners.  It offers an excellent opportunity to provide grantees with state of the art information on how to sustain grant programs and build an enhanced network of resources for children and youth. 


The goal of this project is to package the lessons learned that the Action Center has gained as the TA provider for the SS/HS grantees in cohort one and two with special emphasis on issues of sustainability.  How to sustain a school/community program that stated out with Federal funding remains a challenge  for every new SS/HS grantees and other CMHS grantees as well. The primary product is to be a marketable tool kit that could be used by future grantees and government project officers.

All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST July 29, 2003. 
E-mail and fax are accepted.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a twelve  (12) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 



The goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities among segments of the population, including differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation.  

Thus, in support of the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Tommy Thompson, mandated the elimination of health disparities as a priority for HHS.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an agency within HHS, has a key role in assisting HHS  in strengthening its efforts in improving minority health and in eliminating health disparities by:

1.  	Increasing/expanding efforts to coordinate and integrate disparities activities in those individuals with or at risk for mental and/or addictive disorders;
2.	Developing actions and activities to address weaknesses and gaps identified in the HHS or SAMHSA work plan;
3. 	Identifying leadership opportunities for participation by the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, or  SAMHSA Administrator that highlight a particular health concern, disparities issue, or significant accomplishment on behalf of the Department; and
4.  	Assessing and tracking progress of the Initiative to ensure success.  

These activities must make significant and demonstrable impacts on the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in six priority health issue areas of infant mortality, cancer screening and management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and child/adult immunizations.  

In order to achieve the goals of the Initiative, the Secretary is requiring all the agencies of the Department, such as SAMHSA,  to join him in making a concerted effort to coordinate and integrate disparities throughout the Department; to identify weaknesses and gaps in providing services to the identified racial/ethnic populations; and to develop a means that will assure that Americans are receiving information about the disparity areas and are aware of the steps they can take to prevent or reduce disease and promote their own health.      

PURPOSE:

To analyze SAMSHA grant programs, contracts, and other relevant activities related to the racial/ethnic minority populations (previously specified) impacted by health disparities and to create Departmental reports.  The information gleaned from the various SAMHSA sources and White House Initiative reports should provide information to the Secretary and the White House on SAMHSA=s efforts in eliminating racial and ethnic disparities.  



All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST July 29, 2003.

Statement of Work

Veterans History Project - Radio Outreach
			

Background

In keeping with the Library of Congress policy of public outreach and sharing of collections, the Veterans History Project (VHP) of the American Folklife Center (AFC) at the Library of Congress is seeking to highlight its audio collections through radio outlets.   The goal of the outreach is both to make the Library’s VHP collections known, and as a result attract further materials to the Veterans History Project.  In particular, the Congressionally mandated VHP seeks to make the Project known to veterans and affiliated civilians throughout the country, as well as to individuals and groups interested in interviewing them.

Scope

The Veterans History Project is planning a radio series featuring the VHP collections.  VHP has approached PRI, a prestigious radio outlet, for a possible radio presentation.  Also, VHP’s founding corporate sponsor, AARP, has its own radio outlets, a natural venue for featuring VHP’s collections. 

The contractor shall work within the confines of a mutually agreed-upon concept to produce a multi-part series featuring the VHP collections.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures a firm fixed price award to Ms. Janet L. Martin, 92252 Yorshire Drive, Saline, MI 48176.  The purpose of the acquisition is to update three ACCESS practice expense databases of supplies, clinical labor and equipment.   The acquisition requires extensive experience and familiarity with elements of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) and the practice expense components of the 8,000-plus CPT codes.  The contractor requires extensive knowledge of the terminology used to describe the various practice expense components of clinical personnel, supplies and equipment used in the CPT codes.  In addition, the contractor requires an expertise in working with, creating and manipulating ACCESS databases.  Janet  Martin is a pharmacist and has recently worked on a CMS contract in which she re-priced all the supplies in the PEAC database and also standardized the descriptions, units, and categories throughout the practice expense supply database.  Through her experience with the re-pricing contract, Janet gained the requisite knowledge and expertise necessary to work with the practice expense ACCESS databases in the proposed task   In her role as consultant to multiple medical societies, Janet is already familiar with various PEAC and RUC policies and procedures.  She provides an advisory role to these societies in their development of PEAC spreadsheets for CPT codes that specify direct practice expense inputs for clinical labor, supplies, and equipment.   Therefore, we believe that her expertise is crucial to the agency in completing the review, analysis, verification, and entry of data involved in these tasks in order to deliver complete and accurate databases of our direct practice expense inputs.  The contractor requires a thorough knowledge and experience with ACCESS databases and the creation of new databases.  He/she also needs to be familiar with various medical procedures and possess an awareness of the type of clinical labor, supplies, and equipment needed for them.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>Reference original CBD Publication BAA 96-10 PKRZ, Dated 30 August 1996 - Directorate IWT.  The original publication is being republished as BAA-96-10-IFKA for new concepts and capabilities in the area of INFORMATION WARFARE and replaced with the following.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Chester J. Maciag, Program Manager, 315-330-3184, email: chester.maciag@rl.af.mil; Joe Giordano, Technical Advisor, 315-330-4199, email: joe.Giordano@rl.af.mil; Joetta A. Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308, email: joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil.  AFRL/IF is soliciting White Papers for various studies, capabilities and experiments to increase the Air Force's understanding and capabilities in the area of INFORMATION WARFARE within the context of Joint Vision 2020 and AFDD 2-5. US Forces require rapid access to a wide variety of information to perform their missions. The information required must be reliable and specific information tied to planned operations must be protected. We must preserve and ensure the integrity of our information from exploitation and corruption while denying, delaying, or confusing our potential adversary's ability to act in battle. Innovative research and development approaches are being sought in the INFORMATION WARFARE areas of, (1) information warfare planning functions, (2) improved concepts to deny the adversary's ability to decide and act in battle, (3) maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our information elements, (4) the ability to recover from information attacks, (5) automated methodologies to determine susceptibilities and vulnerabilities of information systems, (6) methods to secure commercial-off-the-shelf applications, (7) capabilities to determine what information systems will be attacked for indications and warnings, trans-attack, and post-mortem phases  (8) capabilities for digital, computer, and network forensics and analysis.  Concepts and capabilities are needed to support a wide variety of missions including worldwide joint and coalition missions. Priority will be given to those ideas which most significantly increase the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our information systems and which have the widest global applicability. In addition, consideration will be given to those concepts with an understanding of adversarial command and control structures as well as the variations in threat systems. The new concepts and capabilities should address the Counter Information needs of US and allied systems for information warfare. The full spectrum of military operations should be considered.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.   Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a 3 - 5 page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institution. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Chester J. Maciag, Reference BAA-96-10-IFKA, AFRL/IFGB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, (2) innovativeness of proposed approach and/or techniques, (3) assessed improvement to Information Warfare capabilities, and (4) the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fees. Also the offer's capability and capacity to achieve the objectives of this BAA will be used. No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Criteria 1-3  above will also be used to determine whether the White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submissions under this BAA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  All responsible firms may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Principal funding of this BAA and the award of contracts started in FY97. Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 to 24 months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $200K to $750K. Total funding for this BAA is $15M. 
Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, AFRL/IFKA, ATTN: Joetta Bernhard, 26 Electronic Pky, Rome, NY 13441-4514, or phone at (315) 330-2308, for information if they contemplate responding. 
The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at time of award.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be ''significant concerns'' and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta Bernhard, (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Linda Reed, Deputy Chief, Contracting Division, at (315) 330-7748. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. 
An information briefing is not planned.  To maximize the possibility of award in FY02, it is recommended that white papers be received by 01 JUL 2002. White papers submitted after that date will also be considered but funding may be limited.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2002.  To receive a copy of the AFRL/IFK publication ''BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry",  Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and e-mail address, and reference BAA96-10-IFKA.  Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>Engineers at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) have developed a novel method for generating and storing electrical power in a borehole.  The new process will eliminate the need for direct wiring or cables as power sources down hole.  The device utilizes piezoelectric components to convert mechanical energy created by the vibrations and flexing associated with drilling into useable electric power.  The generated power would be stored in a capacitor or battery.  The device will continue to generate electricity as long as drill components are flexed, even in very small amounts.  The INEEL is soliciting a joint collaboration with manufacturers of Downhole Seismic Equipment or Drill String Equipment to provide funding and in-kind support to develop full-scale models and conduct a field test.   A successful development project will result in licensing opportunities.  Point of contact:  Phillip B. West, Engineer/scientist 208-526-1538  Email: west@inel.gov  or Jerry Wright Account Executive 208-526-9557  Email: wrighj@inel.gov.

The integrated AUV system must be turnkey and meet the following specifications; The AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small (less than 0.324 m in diameter and 2.5 m in length), and light (less than 100 kg in air).  The AUV must be able to swim at speeds from 2 to over 10 knots and have a mission duration in excess of 20 hours swimming at 2.2 kts and 6 hours swimming at 5 kts while powered by lead-acid gel cell batteries.  The AUV must be able to control speed to within 0.5% of the target speed, hold course to within 1 degree of the planned bearing, and hold depth to an accuracy of ± 2.5 cm.  The AUV must be able to accurately execute missions in excess of 40 n.mi. Completely autonomously.  The AUV must be powered by lead-acid batteries.  The battery packs must be easily changeable for rapid redeployment of the AUV and must also be rechargeable while installed in the AUV and when removed from the AUV.  A suitable battery charger is to be provided that can completely charge a battery pack in less than six hours.  At least two recharchable battery packs must be provided with the AUV.   Additionally, alkaline battery packs must be a provided option and allow missions exceeding 96 hours at 2.2 kts.
The AUV must include fisheries instrumentation including a single-frequency 38 kHz split-beam scientific echo sounder (eg. Simrad EK60) and transducer with 12 degree or narrower beam width (e.g. Simrad ES38-12), a 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (eg. RDI Workhorse), a conductivity-temperature-depth sensor (e.g. Seabird SBE 37si MicroCat), and a stereo digital color still or video camera system (eg. twin Sony DSC U20).  Alternative instrumentation with equivalent or superior specifications may be substituted with consent of the government.
The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly or entirely of commercial off-the-shelf components.  All of the source codes for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is desirable.  The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings.  The vehicle must accommodate a modular payload of up to 1 m in length, 0.324 m in diameter, and 25 kg weight, and associated vehicle lengthening, without appreciable reductions in the operational speed and duration.  The aforementioned fisheries specific equipment can be included in this payload.  The AUV must have a maximum operational depth of at least 150 m (preferably 300m).  The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6°C to 35°C and remain unharmed for storage and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10°C to 45°C.  The AUV must be tolerant of icing and thermal shock encountered when deploying in Polar Regions.  A 10/100 Ethernet connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector.  A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation.  The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer located greater than 1 n.mi. away.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data to the remote computer.  The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.  When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates.
While the AUV is at the surface, geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential GPS. The AUV must be able to acquire GPS updates in sea states up to Beaufort 5. Acoustic Doppler estimates of velocities are to be used for estimating and compensating for vehicle set and drift by currents.  Heading information must be provided by a flux-gate or gyro compass; depth is to be monitored by a pressure sensor; height over the seafloor is to be monitored by an acoustic altimeter; and propeller rotation rate is to be monitored using a Hall effect tachometer.

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis solicitation number is corrected to read FA4600-04-R-0002.  This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  55th Contracting Squadron is issuing this synopsis for the sole purpose of conducting Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of National Target Base (NTB) & National Desired Ground Zero (DGZ) List (NDL) Integrated Development System Version II (NIDS II) software.  Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) developed NIDS II for U. S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM)/ST12.  NIDS II is a 1.2 million-line object oriented, rules-based, user-controlled system.  NIDS II is used to select and code facilities in the NTB, construct and maintain DGZs in the NDL, construct and maintain target island boundaries, validates facility data fields, adds geographical targeting information, determines option suitability, apply risk factor coding to DGZs and provides facility/DGZ quality assurance.  Ongoing requirements include the maintenance of current software and adaptation of NIDS II to new data structure for twice yearly cutovers.  Work in progress includes the completion of reengineering and enhancements to the Delete Add Change Handler (DACHLR) and the Graphical Editor (GRE) functions.  DACHLR and GRE are old programs written in FORTRAN and C, which are being reengineered, enhanced and rewritten in C++ and Ada 95.  GRE enhancements will alter application to graphical display capability that can be initiated at any step in the NTB or NDL development process to view and edit all planning information, including program results.  GRE is scheduled for an FY05 delivery and DACHLR is scheduled for delivery in FY06.  Upcoming modernization efforts include reconfiguring software to client-server, conversion from a Sybase database to an Oracle database, reengineering of Target Island Construction and Maintenance System (TICAMS), automation of designated Targeting functions, compliance with Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE), and conversion to new operating system.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification to the Previous Notice is to correct the date of the Solictation posting date.  The date is hereby changed 28 June 2003 to 28 July 2003.  The text is hereby changed to read as follows:  The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of this contract is projected to begin on 01 January 2004. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 28 July 2003. The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET). The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from http://www.eps.gov, as NO paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 01 October 2003, with a performance start date of 01 January 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. The “DRAFT” Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

Moore, NOAA Contracting Officer, telephone 301-713-4751 This notice is for a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) within the context of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.016. White Papers submitted in response to this BAA must be received not later than 1600 local time on 14 August 2003 AT THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS: U.S. DOC, NOAA, NESDIS, (ATTN:  Jay W. Moore), 8455 Colesville Road, Suite 1450, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3315.  White Papers should reference BAA OFA-GOES-R-3-0001 and should be addressed to the attention of Jay W. Moore. Respondents are directed to notify the Contracting Officer of their intent to respond by sending an email to jay.moore@noaa.gov.  RESPONDENTS MUST GO TO THE FOLLOWING SITE TO DOWNLOAD THE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION FOR THIS BAA:   http://www.osd.noaa.gov/goesr_arch_study/index.htm .  White Papers must be submitted in an original and ten (10) copies. Written format: All White Papers shall use clear, readable, single-spaced type on 8.5 x 11 inch paper, single-sided, unless using charts, which are encouraged where they can be appropriately used to convey approaches and methods.  It is preferable that material be presented using a 10-point font size.  Use of a 12-point proportionately based font is also acceptable.  Also submit all files in .pdf format.  The White Paper must not exceed twenty-five (25) pages of narrative and charts for a single task area proposal or fifty (50) pages of narrative and charts for a multiple task proposal. For further detail, refer to paragraph 2.6 of the Technical Description provided on the NOAA webpage listed below.  Failure of any Respondent to follow these instructions shall lead to omission of information from consideration by the peer review panel, and shall be construed by the Government as the Respondent having made this exclusion purposefully.  This BAA is open to commercial industry, academic institutions, and other interested parties.  It is being sought to solicit alternative architectural concepts for an end-to-end, integrated, remote sensing observing system and data services for GOES-R.  The U.S. Government (USG) Department of Commerce’s (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) primary mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation’s economic, social, and environmental needs.  This mission requires a continuous capability to process, archive and disseminate environmental information to central processing centers and distributed direct users.  This information is acquired and distributed on an extensive spatial range (global, regional and local) within a variety of time scales (minutes to days).  This information includes, but is not limited to: hemispheric imagery; cloud and precipitation parameters; atmospheric profiles of temperature, moisture, wind, aerosols and ozone; surface conditions concerning ice, snow and vegetation; ocean parameters of sea temperature, color and state; solar conditions and in-situ space environment.  These data are critically needed for 1) severe storm and flood warnings; 2) tropical cyclone (hurricane reconnaissance and warnings); 3) hydrologic forecasts and water resources management; 4) ocean surface and internal structures forecasts; 5) medium range forecast outlook (out to fifteen days); 6) solar and space environmental forecasts; 7) aviation forecasts (domestic, military, and international); 8) ice conditions forecasts; 9) seasonal and inter-annual climate forecasts; 10) decadal-scale monitoring of climate variability; 11) long-term global environmental change assessment; 12) environmental air quality monitoring and emergency response; 13) fire and volcanic eruption detection and analysis; and 14) short-term and mesoscale forecasts.  To meet requirements and accomplish NOAA’s mission, the current geostationary satellite systems perform three major functions:  (1) ENVIRONMENTAL SENSING: Acquisition, generation and dissemination of atmospheric imaging and sounding data, solar and space environment (in-situ) data, land and ocean surface data.  (2) DATA COLLECTION:  Interrogation and receipt of data from Earth surface-based data collection platforms and relay to the NOAA command and data acquisition stations.  (3) DATA BROADCAST:  Continuous relay of meteorological data to distributed users, independent of other system functions and relay of distress signals from aircraft or marine vessels to search and rescue ground stations.  Historically, the ground systems associated with the geostationary satellites, which perform the data and product processing, distribution, archive and user interface functions have been addressed independently from the satellites.  In the future, proposed systems need not be unique to GOES-R and may be components of existing or future over-arching (higher level) operational systems within NOAA.  For example, new and/or upgraded capabilities required for enhanced GOES-R series functions in the areas of product generation, distribution networks, and archive facilities must be identified, planned, budgeted, and implemented.  To effectively and efficiently meet the GOES-R system requirements, a complete end-to-end (data sensing to information access) approach must be adopted.  In addition, the architecture concepts must maintain compatibility with all heritage satellite meteorological information collection needs and existing interfaces.  As a result, the end-to-end GOES-R architecture must define interfaces internal within the GOES-R system and external to the appropriate NESDIS systems.  The Government desires to research complete end-to-end system architecture options that assess the infusion of new or existing technologies that may enhance performance and reduce costs.  Respondents are encouraged to propose innovative methods to meet the performance requirements and provide cost benefits.  However, it is recognized that potential Respondents may not have the capability or desire to research and address the complete end-to-end architecture.  Therefore, Respondents may choose to propose one or more of the following Task Areas:  Task Area 1:  Space and Launch Segments; Task Area 2:  Command, Control and Communications (C3) Segments; Task Area 3:  Production Generation and Distribution, Archive and Access, and User Interface Segments; Task Area 4:  End-to-End System Integration.  Respondent’s can only submit one proposal comprised of either a single task or multiple tasks.  The Government requires a White Paper detailing the conceptual architecture concepts, advanced state of the art technology studies involved, and past performance information demonstrating Respondent’s capability to perform the Task Area(s) that they are proposing.  This capability demonstration must include a description of the Respondent’s past experience in developing GOES systems or similar/like systems, identifying the contract, a current reference person and phone number, and the Respondent’s role in the performance of said contract(s).  The Respondent must identify feasible architectures that will advance R&D studies, or enhance NOAA’s mission capabilities or its interests in the GOES-R System, and identify past capabilities.  The Government’s Technical Description, notional GOES R architecture, and other supporting documents are online at: http://www.osd.noaa.gov/goesr_arch_study/index.htm.  The requesting office intends to rank the responses using a panel of experts known as the NOAA/NASA Peer Review Panel (hereafter, the “Panel”).  The Panel ranking will be based upon 1) Respondent’s experience on similar missions; 2) Respondent’s current capability, evidenced by its corporate, research, and industrial resources to produce the GOES-R system or portions of the system corresponding to the Task Area(s) the Respondent is proposing; and, 3) how the research component of Respondent’s study plan will contribute to NOAA’s assessment of alternative architectures and advance the GOES-R mission.  The Panel will advise the selection official on the responses that offer demonstrated capability to perform the Task Area(s), and potentially innovative and feasible research opportunities that will advance the GOES-R mission.  The Government contemplates an award of multi-tiered study contracts in the Fall 2003.  It is anticipated that Tier 1 will consist of System Architecture Concepts, and Tier 2 of System Architecture Definition, which will provide additional definition and refinement to the initial study, such as additional Cost –as-an-Independent-Variable (CAIV) trades, risk identification, or other value-added details.  Respondents to this BAA are assured that the Government will protect their proprietary data.  Prior to the Government using this information, it will review with the Respondent use of their trade secret data.   NON-RESPONSE TO THIS BAA WILL NOT PRECLUDE FUTURE COMPETITION FOR ANY ENSUING SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. NOAA anticipates awarding several Study contracts.  The anticipated value of the Tier 1 Task Areas are: (1) Task Area 1 - $1.0M, (2) Task Area 2 - $0.5M, (3) Task Area 3 - $0.5M, and (4) Task Area 4 - $0.5M over an approximately 12-month effort. No Respondent will be paid for the same work more than once.  Respondents are advised that the Government may secure the following consultants to provide supporting analyses on the Respondents’ White Papers or proposals, for purposes of including a non-biased, third-party assessment from experts in the respective fields of satellite systems, engineering, and communications, and ground systems: The Aerospace Corporation; Veridian, Inc.; MIT Lincoln Labs; The MITRE Corporation; MitreTEK; Swales Aerospace; Tecolote, QSS, and User Technology Associates. These organizations will sign and submit non-disclosure and organizational conflict of interest certifications to the Government in anticipation of these proposed analyses. These consultants will not, however, score any White Papers or proposals.  Access to your White Papers shall be handled under the FAR, Part 3.104, and 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), to protect any specified confidential or proprietary business data. General information about the NOAA geostationary satellite program can be found at http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes.

 POSITION TITLE:  Madagascar Agriculture and Trade Team Leader
 MARKET VALUE:  GS-14
 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Two years with option to renew up to five years
 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  USAID/Madagascar
 SECURITY ACCESS:  Secret
 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens
 
POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID/Madagascar plans to implement a Strategic Objective (SO) to address agriculture and trade development under its five-year strategy (2003-2008).  This SO will address agricultural based market development, and business development.  The program is expected to introduce more productive technology, build links between producers, agribusinesses and external markets and improve economic and trade policies which encourage investment and exports.  This new SO, entitled Madagascar Agriculture and Trade (MAT) will complement the Environment/Rural Development SO as well as the Mission’s Food Security activities.  

Under this SO, Critical Private Markets Expanded, selected interventions will be undertaken based on three primary criteria: (i) potential for a significant contribution to economic growth; (ii) contribution to poverty reduction; and (iii) complementarity with biodiversity conservation/natural resource management activities.  In Madagascar, food insecurity is primarily caused by poverty.  An estimated 80% of rural families are poor.  As these families farm for their livelihoods, market led agricultural development will concurrently improve their incomes and food security.  Market led agricultural growth will also discourage slash and burn agriculture, the greatest threat to Madagascar’s biodiversity rich forests, and provide employment and livelihood opportunities that draw growing populations away from threatened forest corridors.  Madagascar Agriculture and Trade, the Environment and Rural Development SO, and Food Security activities will be mutually reinforcing.  Market led agricultural growth can reduce poverty and improve food security while also leading to biodiversity conservation.  

There are direct and important links between agriculture, rural income, food security, forest conservation, and disaster preparedness.  Madagascar is highly susceptible to frequent cyclones.  Cyclones cause much greater destruction to landscapes, roads, railroads and irrigation systems where forests have been cleared and hillsides cannot absorb rainfall and stagger runoff.  The MAT SO shall increase small farmer access to modern technologies as alternatives to slash and burn agriculture, the principal deforestation cause in Madagascar.  

Madagascar has impressive economic growth potential.  It leads the world in vanilla, clove and litchi markets.  Farmers produce an array of attractive commodities.  These include: fresh fruits and vegetables; robusta and arabica coffees; tea; cereals (rice, maize, wheat), tubers (cassava, yams, potatoes); dried beans; oilseeds (soybean, sunflower, peanuts); essential oils (aloe, ylang ylang, ravinala); spices (pepper, ginger); fibers (cotton, silk); tree crops (cashews, cocoa, coconut, palm); dairy products; livestock; and poultry.  There are also agricultural market linkages with southern Africa, Europe and the US (under African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA)).  Among non-agricultural commodities, textiles led much of the economy’s growth in recent years, with the trade advantages afforded by AGOA playing a significant role.  Madagascar has also become one of the world’s major suppliers of rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and other precious and semi-precious stones, though the bulk of this trade remains outside of formal channels.  There are also opportunities for growth in artisanal products.  
 
Under USAID/Madagascar’s 1997- 2003 strategy, the Landscape Development Intervention (LDI) program, part of the Biodiversity Conservation Strategic Objective, links farmer groups to agribusinesses.  LDI implements farmer group and agribusiness credit programs; uses farmer to farmer extension for technology dissemination (organic ginger, agroforestry); supports trade missions (South Africa, USA) and market research; and provides business development services to agribusinesses that buy products from small farmers.  PL 480, Title II programs also support agricultural production, while other activities provide information and training on international trade agreements.

I. POSITION DESCRIPTION

 
INTRODUCTION

OTI was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/oti/ 

PROGRAM SUMMARY

The modern history of the Congo has been of a country rich in natural wealth that has the potential to transform central Africa into an economic powerhouse.  The reality is a sad litany of exploitation at the expense of the indigenous population that stretches from rubber through, diamonds, uranium and cobalt up to coltan in the present.   Despite this or perhaps because of this, the Congolese people have proven to be amazingly resilient, surviving under the harshest conditions and remaining fiercely proud of their rich nation and it’s potential.  

Attempts to end the conflict that started in 1998 were discouraging until the assignation of LDK in January 2001. A lack of consistent political will by the main belligerents continues to drag the peace process out.  In spite of this the international community continues to support the newly formed transitional government and expansion of the size and role of UN Peacekeeping forces (MONUC) in what they perceive as an inexorable process towards an end to the conflict.   

However, despite the progress the situation for the Congolese remains extremely dire, with up to 2.5 million deaths attributed directly or indirectly to the conflict.  Foreign armies in the country, (Rwanda) continue to maintain a substantial presence. Rebel groups have splintered and irregular forces (milita, interahamwe and mai mai ) continue to support ethnic clashes and “hit and run assaults” in large areas of the NE and east of the country.  The causes/justification for the war are now more complicated morphing from a security basis to natural resource exploitation and control of trade. 

The country is currently made up of population centers so cut off from one another they have become virtual islands. The remnants of the colonial infrastructure after 40 years of near total neglect, has finally collapsed.   The occupying military forces, friend and foe alike live off the land increasing the level of extortion and petty graft to the point that movement of people and goods has decreased precipitously.  The agriculturally based economy has ground to a halt in many places due to the increase in insecurity, and the closure of key commercial links that cross military lines, eg the Congo river.  This has further accentuated community isolation.

USAID/OTI’s goal in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is to support the country’s transition from war to peace and lay the groundwork for an eventual transition to democracy and the country’s reunification.  Isolation of key population centers has constrained civil society’s role in this transition.  To alleviate this constraint, OTI is developing and implementing a national, multi-faceted, communication strategy that fosters exchanges across the country focusing on dialogue, conflict prevention, and engaging the Congolese in debates of national importance.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

To assist in the implementation of USAID/OTI's political transition program, and other USAID/OTI activities in DRC, the Program Manager will perform the following duties:

-	Support management of the hub offices in Kisangani, Bukavu, Bunia and Kindu and identify staffing and administrative needs 

-	Participate in team building exercises and implementation of strategic objectives for program with the USAID mission and Embassy staff as appropriate.

-	Assist in the implementation of program activities aimed at ameliorating conflict, rehabilitating human and physical infrastructure, and supporting the development of civil society and independent media organizations. 

-	In conjunction with local entities and the OTI contractor/grantee, develop quick disbursing Political Transition Grants (PTGs) to achieve USAID objectives.  Monitor, evaluate and develop reporting procedures for these grants.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  55th Contracting Squadron is issuing this synopsis for the sole purpose of conducting Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of National Target Base (NTB) & National Desired Ground Zero (DGZ) List (NDL) Integrated Development System Version II (NIDS II) software.  Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) developed NIDS II for U. S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM)/ST12.  NIDS II is a 1.2 million-line object oriented, rules-based, user-controlled system.  NIDS II is used to select and code facilities in the NTB, construct and maintain DGZs in the NDL, construct and maintain target island boundaries, validates facility data fields, adds geographical targeting information, determines option suitability, apply risk factor coding to DGZs and provides facility/DGZ quality assurance.  Ongoing requirements include the maintenance of current software and adaptation of NIDS II to new data structure for twice yearly cutovers.  Work in progress includes the completion of reengineering and enhancements to the Delete Add Change Handler (DACHLR) and the Graphical Editor (GRE) functions.  DACHLR and GRE are old programs written in FORTRAN and C, which are being reengineered, enhanced and rewritten in C++ and Ada 95.  GRE enhancements will alter application to graphical display capability that can be initiated at any step in the NTB or NDL development process to view and edit all planning information, including program results.  GRE is scheduled for an FY05 delivery and DACHLR is scheduled for delivery in FY06.  Upcoming modernization efforts include reconfiguring software to client-server, conversion from a Sybase database to an Oracle database, reengineering of Target Island Construction and Maintenance System (TICAMS), automation of designated Targeting functions, compliance with Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE), and conversion to new operating system.

In addition, contractor personnel should be experienced in object-oriented design and implementation in C, C++, Ada, and have experience with using Ethernet with TCP/IP for distributed processing.  All software previously developed was in accordance with DODSTD-2167A (Expired), DOD HDBK 287 (Expired), Air Force standards and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and will not be redeveloped with new standards unless determined necessary.  New software will follow Air Force standards and STRATCOM regulations or an agreed upon and documented process.  Contractor personnel shall possess expertise in the following areas: NTB target selection and DGZ construction methods as employed by USSTRATCOM/ST12, NTB target selection and DGZ construction software, rules-based systems, object-oriented design, and numerical algorithms as they relate to DGZ construction and aimpoint optimization.  They must also have familiarity with the PDCALC probability of damage methodology, NATO nuclear war planning methodologies, NIMA mapping standards, and SAMPK methodologies.  The contractor must maintain a TOP SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for TOP SECRET documents and equipment and be configured to use a secret link between USSTRATCOM and offsite development facilities.

<SUBJECT>T -- FILMWRITING
<DESC>Purpose:  
The Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC) located in Salt Lake City provides a variety of products and services including technical applications and a variety of geographic or mapping products for the USDA Forest Service.  These mapping products include traditional lithographic as well as more progressive “on-demand” technologies and other digital or electronic enabled geographic data.  

GSTC is planning a transition from the use of in-plant filmwriting and imagesetting devices to the use of, industry-provided pre-press technologies and products.  These services must utilize digital imaging processes that eliminate the reliance on the use of photographic film materials.  This transition shall include a variety of available computer-to-plate/press technologies.  The objective of the transition is to increase efficiencies and improve production capacity for cartographic publishing. The transition would include the ability to publish, plot, print or view a map product, produced electronically using digital technology.  The completed products may include: a) lithographic printing and b) on-demand-printing.  With escalating photographic film costs and other associated materials, and the loss of in-plant filmwriting and imagesetting capabilities; GSTC is seeking a cost effective process for delivery of cartographic published products.  

Background:  
GSTC is nearing the completion of a significant re-engineering effort of a map production system.  This new system has been designed to produce as output standard data formats.  Any resulting contract must operate utilizing the outputs requirements of the new system and provide efficient workflows with existing proprietary file formats.   

The digital imaging output environment shall be built upon commercial software and hardware.  The implementation of this process shall produce a wide variety of standard, custom, or publication quality products. 

We anticipate a significant cost benefit from robust output processes and digital imaging technologies such as computer-to-plate or other digital process capability to produce cartographic rich map products.

Scope:  
GSTC will be contracting for:

l)Lithographic printing plates using computer-to-plate (CTP) technology or equivalent technology.  
2)Output of proofs from digital files.  
3)Photographic film products - Ability to produce negative film products that adhere to lithographic printing specifications upon request.
4)Produce digital graphic files that support on-demand-printing.  These will include – PostScript, eps, pdf, TIFF.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Research Operations and Monitoring Contract
<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to negotiate with Westat under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), Unique Capabilities, for a modification to increase the volume of activity under Contract N01-AI-15445 through the completion of the existing contract that ends 06/14/2006. This contract was awarded using full-and-open competition under SIC Code 8731 (currently NAICs 541710); for the period 06/15/2001 through 06/15/2006. As the sponsor of federally funded clinical trials research, DAIDS has an on-going regulatory responsibility for oversight of some 200 studies conducted at over 800 sites in 41 countries, and Westat has assumed a significant part of this responsibility through this contract.  Westat currently provides domestic and international on-site monitoring, site management, regulatory support, protocol development, operations support and training services for a large portfolio of investigator-initiated trials as well as all trials funded and pending funding within the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA).  In responding to the scientific priorities of the evolving HIV/AIDS epidemic and also in response to the growth of the CIPRA program to increasing numbers of countries and sites, more studies as well as more complex trials have been implemented at more sites than originally planned. These new sites are both domestic and in resource poor settings in the developing world that require the same level of monitoring, training, protocol development support, operations support and regulatory support as currently provided by the contract. The negotiated modification will provide for an increase in the current activity to continue to provide support to the on-going clinical trial monitoring, training, protocol development support and regulatory support of the Westat contract. Westat is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance under the current contract and through their establishment of relationships with developing international sites. If this portion of Westat’s requirement were awarded to another contractor at this time, interruptions and/or inconsistencies in the normal monitoring operations of DAIDS would result.   In addition,  a transition would delay protocol development for a multitude of CIPRA funded studies.  Training efforts tailored specifically to CIPRA requirements would cease, causing extensive delays in trial implementation and negatively impacting on the operations of current studies. Therefore, no other services will satisfy Agency requirements. If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. You are directed to Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>--Sensor Fusion Technology Symposium
<DESC>NA INTRODUCTION The Fusion Symposium is the result of a series of events focused on gaining an understanding of Objective Force fusion requirements.  The initial efforts were the Sensor Fusion and Operator Workload Map Exercises (MAPEX) conducted at Fort Huachuca in Febru ary 2003.  The intent of these MAPEXs was to evaluate a set of Essential Elements of Analysis (EEA) established to meet TRADOC experimentation goals supporting Future Combat System Milestone B decisions. In the analysis of the MAPEX data a determination wa s made that some of the EEA were not sufficiently explored, especially in the areas the fusion technologies.  The decision was additional analysis was needed and that the best way to accomplish that analysis was to host a technology workshop.  The Fusion T echnology Workshop was held in May 03 to address noted analytical shortfalls noted in the MAPEXs.  The three-day workshop focused on the technology and knowledge challenges facing fusion in the Objective Force.  One of the outcomes of the workshop was the suggestion that Fort Huachuca sponsor a symposium inviting government and industry to lay out their solutions to the fusion challenges noted in the workshop.  That symposium will take place 20-22 August 2003 at Fort Huachuca.  BRIEFING AGENDA 1.  We are soliciting papers and presentations for the Sensor Fusion Technology Symposium.  We will receive papers and requests until 25 July 2003.  Please submit a 250-word unclassified abstract to explain how your effort addresses Sensor Fusion architect ures, applications, and interfaces.   2.  The Sensor Fusion Technology Symposium is being organized to provide a forum for information exchange between the government, academia, and industrial research communities.  To achieve this we are assembling a group of professionals in the same room to  let them discuss candidly Sensor Fusion architectures, applications, and interfaces. 3.  Spanning three days, the Sensor Fusion Technology Symposium will focus on the vital issues facing Sensor Fusion, Sensor Fusion technologies, and Sensor Fusion solutions.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE-SOURCE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CONTRACT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS CENTER FOR NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE DOD JOINT VACCINE ACQUISITION PROGRAM.
<DESC>NA INFORMATIONAL SYNOPSIS NOTICE: This synopsis is for informational purposes only. The Joint Program Executive Office for Biological Defense, Chemical-Biological-Medical Systems Project Management Office, has a critical requirement to conduct a three-month study of the reliability of cent ral nervous system responses to the administration of Botulinum toxin vaccine serotypes, in support of the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program. Specifically, the study will test Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes using spontaneously active neuronal networks grow ing on microelectrode assays in vitro. The study will also test established antibodies to prove that such networks represent efficient, reliable platforms for routine antibody testing. And, the study will examine response patterns, reliability of the respo nses, and Lethal Dose-50. The long-term objective of the study will be to develop a neuronal network-based, in vitro assay system that identifies and quantifies the presence of all Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, to shorten the assay time, and to replace t he need for live mice as the assay element for the systematic screening of Botulinum neurotoxin serotype antibodies. A sole-source contract for the acquisition of scientific research and development services is contemplated. This synopsis provides notice t hat the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to award a sole-source contract to the University of North Texas Center for Network Neuroscience at Denton, Texas, to perform a one-time study. The authority for negotiating this sole-source acqui sition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1)- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirement, as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(A). This effort will rely upon the UNT Center for Network Ne uroscience's unique capability to provide the particular research services needed. This action is not open to allied participation.

<DESC>NA The Defense Contracting Command-Washington, on behalf of Headquarters, U.S. Army Materiel Command (HQAMC), is issuing this combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented wi th additional information included in this notice.  This announcement is a request for quotes/proposals and constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is DASW01-03-T-HV W1.  The North American Ind ustrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210, Application Software, Computer, Packaged.  Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13 as of 17 April 2003.   The Statement of Work is as follows:   1.0	 General Scope of Work.  Headquarters Army Materiel Command (HQ AMC) requires the purchase of an automated HQ AMC Suspense Tracking System (STS) in order to facilitate information and workflow management to more effectively provide timely advice and re commendations to the Command Group.  The primary users will be the SGS Staff Action Control Officers, Chief of Staff, Deputy Commanding General, and G-Staff (major and separate offices) executive officers and the secondary users will be the G-Staff designa ted action officers for each suspense requirement.  This effort will consist of project management, development, customization, installation, implementation, training, and maintenance. The Deputy Commanding General (DCG) directed to standardize various HQ AMC   suspense tracking systems into a single centralized suspense tracking system, which would be compatible with the projected universal AKO system. 2.0	 Background.       There are many requests for assistance or requirements, either internally or externally initiated for completion by AMC.  Suspense's exist that need to be tracked due to constraints on existing requirements. There are several STSs currently operating  within HQ AMC that will need to be consolidated into one, single system in order to not only minimize operational and system administration costs, but to better manage all suspenses.  MAGIC STS (web-based system owned and managed by the G3 functionally) a nd the Lotus Notes 4.6 STS (client-server based system owned and managed by the SGS functionally) are the 2 main systems that will need to be consolidated.  The remaining home-grown systems utilize Microsoft Excel and Access, but are not being considered f or data migration.  It has been determined that one year of data will be migrated, containing key elements, from the main systems which will be consolidated for historic reference and key open/pending active suspenses in the new system. Processing hardware  will reside at HQAMC and be behind the HQAMC firewall and no external (outside of the .mil domain) hardware will be used. 3.0	 Tasks. 3.1	Requirements/Performance Standards: The contractor shall develop, deliver, install and maintain a HQ AMC Suspense Tracking System for use by approximately 1100 personnel at 11 locations.  This system shall possess the following minimum performance capa bility: 3.2	The system shall provide Command-wide organizational (Secretary of the GeneralÃ¢Â€Â™s Staff Office for each Major Subordinate Command (MSC): HQAMC, AMCOM, CECOM, JMC, RDECOM, SBCCOM, TACOM, USASAC, Executive Officer for each Separate Reporting Activity  SRAs-LOGSA, LOGISTIC LEADERSHIP CENTER, ISA, and EDCA) visibility. Visibility is defined as the ability for key action officers to generate and control suspenses while at the same time controlling access rights down to the field level (at least read-only permission) to suspenses for the remainder of the STS users.  3.3	The system shall be MS Windows-based. 3.4	The system shall be web-based, compatible with both IE 5.X and Netscape 4.7X or greater. 3.5	The system shall have advanced (Boolean) search capabilities interoperable with AKO standards.  The system shall have ability to locate wor kflow items by case number, subject, tasking authority, due date, key words etc. (See 19 February 2003 Army CIO policy on AKO collaboration tools suite standards.) 3.6	The system shall be required to standardize various HQAMC suspense tracking systems to a single collaborative system fully integrated with Outlook (Outlook version 2000 or newer) e-mail.  3.7	The STS shall be Compatible with current hardware (Compaq multi-processor clustered and multi-processor non-clustered servers running Win NT/Win 2000).  The desktops are at least 500 MHz Intel CPUs with at least 128 MG RAM.  3.8	The STS shall accept all documents in scanned or digital format.  The documents will be stored in the document management system by the office initiating the suspense.   3.9	The STS shall integrate with current electronic document management system.

<SUBJECT>A -- Research to quantify the economic benefits of street trees and further develop a computer program called STRATUM.
<SOLNBR>STRATUM-03
<RESPDATE>081503
<ARCHDATE>08162003
<CONTACT>Bernadette Jaquint, Grants and Agreements Specialist, Phone 510 559-6309, Fax 510 559-6440, Email bjaquint
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Center for Urban Forest Research, Pacific Southwest Research Station intends to enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements for a research program to quantify the economic benefits of street trees for specified communities. The research program is intended to create an opportunity for every community in the U.S. to quantify benefits of its urban forest, while promoting continued research and development to strengthen the scientific underpinnings of urban forest benefit-cost analysis.
The Forest Service will conduct research to develop STRATUM (a computer program developed by the Forest Service called Street Tree Resource Analysis Tool for Urban forest Managers) compatible, priced Resource Units (RUs)—the dollar value (e.g., the amount of energy saved in kWh/yr) used to determine and calculate benefits of individual trees. The Cooperator will use this information and STRATUM to quantify economic benefits of street trees in specified communities. The Forest Service and Cooperator will partner to further develop and transfer this value-added product. This agreement will improve urban forest management in six distinct ways:
·	Enable managers to better justify program budgets
·	Increase public awareness and support for programs
·	Leverage funding for tree management from electric utilities, corporations, stormwater management districts, and air quality improvement programs
·	Connect the magnitude of tree benefits with management and budgeting levels
·	Promote a population-based management approach over a tree-based approach
·	Maximize net benefits.
One outcome of this project is an improved computer program for street tree assessment (STRATUM) to optimize design and management and project future benefits and costs given various management scenarios. Another outcome is a low-cost approach to quantifying urban forest benefits that will rapidly enter the market, enabling communities to benefit through improved management.
We are looking for Cooperators who will: 
·	Contribute funds to Forest Service research and development efforts for STRATUM.  Funding will be dollar-cost averaged to a per tree basis for the total street tree population.  If a sample is taken, the calculated total population is used to determine the total amount.
·	Supply Forest Service with tree data as determined by mutual agreement for use in adjusting tree growth curves.
·	Provide Forest Service with all information that Cooperator has collected relative to the tree inventory of the specified city, including all trees and/or sites inventoried and their attributes.
·	Provide Forest Service with information and specifications relative to the problems encountered with current products and the desired specifications of the products if subjected to the process that is the objective of this Agreement. 
·	Supply Forest Service with final report produced by Cooperator for its client, including benefit-cost analysis for inclusion in database.

The Forest Service will:

·	Provide Cooperator with STRATUM software for benefit analysis. Computer code developed by the Forest Service will remain in the public domain.
·	Provide Cooperator with priced RUs customized for predominant and “other” tree species based on tree type for specified city in a STRATUM compatible format.
·	Provide Cooperator with a summary report that includes data sources, methods used for calculating RUs and their valuation, and scope of appropriate usage.
·	Facilitate annual STRATUM users group meetings for the term of the agreement to discuss current research findings and direction, marketing, and product development.
