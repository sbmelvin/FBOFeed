<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service Agency (FSA) is investigating the use of alternative methods of delivering, disseminating, and integrating large geospatial datasets to FSA and other users.  The Government is requesting information on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software systems and/or commercial web mapping interface services that offer a potential alternative to FSA's current delivery and data management system.  The objective of this RFI is to investigate more effective and efficient ways to integrate geographic information system (GIS) applications with FSA business data.  This RFI also provides a record and evidence of proper market research.  This RFI was prepared for USDA Farm Service Agency, 1400 Independence Ave SW, Washington DC, 20008.


B.  BACKGROUND
The FSA is responsible for administering USDA farm programs including crop commodity price support, disaster relief, and assistance for conservation practices.  FSA administers farm programs in part by digitizing and maintaining agricultural field boundaries, or common land units (CLU) from digital orthoimagery acquired from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).  CLU boundaries consist of fence lines, roads, waterways, and other cultural features, which form the interface between agricultural vegetative cover and non crop vegetative cover on the surface.  Another key aspect of farm program administration is to verify that agricultural practices are in accordance with USDA program parameters.  FSA has performed this verification by using NAIP imagery which is acquired during peak agricultural growing seasons on an annual basis.  The aerial imagery, along with existing program parameters, is viewed in a GIS application at county based USDA Service Centers to show crops and agricultural practices.  CLU boundaries are displayed to assist with identification of farm parcels and acreages.  The use of NAIP imagery has been successful in providing FSA current orthoimagery for maintaining CLU boundaries and performing farm program administration.  It has also provided participating government agencies with current, accurate orthoimagery for their GIS programs.

CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS.  Approximately 2,350 service center offices exist throughout the country representing mission critical locations for storing and managing geospatial data.  Updates for all of the dynamic geospatial data types are performed at the service centers.  In addition to the standard geospatial data types and sources, service centers also store and use supplemental data that are provided to them by state and local governments and private sector sources.  In the current environment, each service center has a state IT staff that maintains, updates, and secures the infrastructure.  The amount and availability of information from one service center to the next is inaccessible to any user above the service center level.  In the current environment, cataloging and publishing metadata on service center data holdings would add to the already overstretched staff resources at the local and state levels.

All Service Centers have a Hewlett-Packard(R) ProLiant(TM) ML370 File Server with SQL/SDE applications and an IBM(R) AS/400 server.  The CLU data layer(s) reside on the ProLiant server and is accessed by the CLU Maintenance Tool, which is a customized application based on the ArcGIS(TM) software from ESRI(R), that runs on the client workstations.  Clients can only access data on the local server and cannot edit data outside the administrative area.  State and national employees cannot access the data without being at the physical site for any user friendly editing experience.  The current architecture has the GIS data and business data located at the same physical location, but there is no integration with the business tabular data, which resides on the AS/400 except at the Land Use (LU) pilot sites which is ~240 sites around the country.  The AS/400s are targeted for phase out due to functional obsolescence and as applications are deployed to migrate business applications to a centralized, web environment.  The ProLiant ML370s have outlasted their warranty and ITS does not wish to extend their support for applications on this hardware under these circumstances.  As a result, a replacement is needed to house the GIS data in the ~2,350 offices nationwide.

In the current environment, FSA national headquarters is limited in direct access to the local service centers? databases.  Database administrators at Kansas City have the ability to access data on an ad hoc basis and the scope of their work is very limited once access is gained.  However, the absence of a central repository precludes users from viewing and analyzing data for the entire country, states, or multi-county regions.  Because the majority of geospatial activities are carried out at service centers, access to the distributed service center databases would have to be established to evaluate accuracy and completeness of any geospatial task.  The current environment requires additional resources and personnel dedicated to the operations and maintenance of the ProLiant ML370 servers located at the service centers.  The current process also hinders the ability of users at national headquarters and state offices to access information processed at the service center level.

FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS CONCEPT.  The future environment will consist of a centralized, fully integrated architecture potentially to be hosted at the National IT Center (NITC) and the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) web farms located in Kansas City and Salt Lake City, respectfully.  GIS applications hosted in a centralized architecture will improve communication between national headquarters, state offices, and the service centers.  It is envisioned that an integrated architecture will allow end users to access data from a central location, thus reducing the redundant and time consuming tasks of requesting information from a specific service center.  Additionally, the USDA Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) has requested that consideration be given to removing the hardware (ProLiant and AS/400) from all service centers and consolidating the equipment into six data centers.  A centralized environment will greatly reduce the risks associated with the physical security of the IT infrastructure.  Centralizing FSA's GIS requirements also meets the intent of Congressional committee discussions and language in the 2008 Farm Bill.

In a centralized environment, work stations in service centers will use thin clients to connect to central web or terminal server applications.  Internet browsers and/or Citrix Systems(R) terminal server software will enable connections to centrally hosted applications and data servers.  The centralized/integrated architecture will host the majority of GIS business applications and data on the dedicated central servers.


C.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Government is soliciting responses from industry addressing an enterprise approach to delivering custom GIS data information to FSA and other users.  The GIS data shall be integrated with farm program business data ensuring cost effective and efficient program delivery to internal and external customers.  The COTS packages and/or services should enable expedited compliance with Congressional mandates and other information requests, and leverage USDA's investment in geospatial data and computing technologies.  Please address all questions and requirements and include feedback on all related topics, including application implementation costs, licensing costs, schedules, and risks.  In addition, please feel free to provide other recommendations or suggestions on related subjects or issues.

At a minimum, please respond to the questions in the following sections:

1)  APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE:  USDA is looking for a lightweight client based GIS analysis tool that will provide a robust application to enable USDA personnel the ability to interact with their customers.  A Virtual Globe (VG) or geographic exploration system (GES) client, enabling 3-D globe visualization is envisioned as a preferred solution.  Describe the client side architecture and graphical user interface that would be implemented via your product.  Describe the server side architecture of your application discussing server footprints, network bandwidth requirements, and processing capacities required to support a solution that delivers raster and vector datasets to the 2300+ USDA locations across the nation.  Does your system architecture adhere to design principles of service-orientation architecture (SOA)?  Is the application IPv6 compliant?  Is the product an open source product or proprietary?

2)  DATASET INTEGRATION:  In order to be a productive tool, the ability to integrate tabular, vector and raster datasets is required.  Please describe your applications ability to fuse tabular, vector, and raster data from both a web services based access model as well as via direct connections to remotely located spatial and non spatial databases across the USDA WAN.  What common geospatial data formats and common data interchange protocols does your application support for integrating data and web services?

Base imagery for the VG environment is also an important aspect of the overall solution.  Describe the methods by which imagery would be made available to the client application.  What processing is required to integrate a national scale, 1 meter resolution or greater, imagery dataset into your application for base mapping purposes?  What is the time involved to integrate, on a yearly basis, more current imagery as it becomes available?  Are there specific formats or standards that an existing imagery dataset must meet prior to being integrated with your product?  Is there the ability to integrate high resolution elevation data (e.g. derived from IFSAR/LIDAR) into the deployed solution?  Does the ability to integrate with existing USDA WMS based imagery services exist, or would the imagery data need be hosted within a proprietary architecture?

3)  SECURITY:  Certain USDA datasets contain sensitive data protected under U.S. privacy laws.  Please describe the supported authentication processes available within your product, and discuss the ability of your product to integrate into an existing department wide authentication mechanism such as USDA's eAuthentication system.  Does the software support role-based authorization? Does the ability to have different users access different datasets or different components of the same dataset (attribute and geospatial) exist?

4)  BASIC GIS CAPABILITY:  Basic GIS functions and analysis tools are necessary to support USDA's requirements.  The need to support complex GIS editing tasks is not a requirement for the purposes of this RFI.  Please describe your applications client GIS capability.  Does it allow for querying and navigation to areas of interest, such as cities or counties? Is full gazetteer functionality supported?  Does the product allow for the identification of features?  Can feature attributes be accessed, viewed, queried, and used as selection criteria?  Can vector features be used within basic geospatial tasks such as intersections and buffer creation?  Can non-spatial (tabular) data be queried through the geospatial interface?  Is panning and swiveling of the globe supported?  Can the user create 'place marks' to annotate and bookmark areas of interested with stored text, pictures, or other information?  Is there the ability to clip and extract areas of interest with metadata, projection, and/or georeferencing information intact?  What other basic GIS capabilities exist?  Describe both the client side and server side geoprocessing and geocoding capabilities that would be available within an implemented solution with your products.

5)  SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM SUPPORT:  USDA typically works in  NAD83/UTM projection, but requires other projections such as State Plane and WGS84.  Describe the ability of your product to merge geospatial data from different spatial reference systems and the ability render maps and globes in different reference systems?  Does the ability exist to determine a base reference system based on parameters identified on a 'per user' or 'user group' basis?  Are there limits to the precision of data that can be used across these various reference systems?  Is high precision vector (less than 1 mm precision) data supported? 

6)  COLLABORATION:  USDA users need to share spatial data among co-workers.  Does your application support collaboration such as sharing geospatial markers between users?  Is peer to peer file sharing and minor workflow integration supported?  Is there additional networking components or hardware components required to support this data sharing and workflow integration?  What are the Area of Interest (AOI), map template, and print functionalities?  Do they support cartographic map layout features such as legends, title blocks, scale bars, north arrows, tic marks, etc.?

7)  EXTENDIBILITY:  USDA may need to extend the application capability or create custom tools for office personnel.  Can the base functionality of the product be extended via custom GIS tasks or other software components?  Can web based services providing canned GIS/geoprocessing tasks be incorporated into the toolset?  Is an object oriented software development kit (SDK) provided as part of the application architecture?  What customizable reporting capabilities are available?  What developer support is available?  What printing functionality is available?  Is high resolution, cartographic quality printing supported?

8)  SCALABILITY:  USDA has expectations of integrating these new technologies with the public's demand for GIS data and remote access to FSA programs.  Describe the ability of your application to support a tiered architecture, enabling access by both USDA office personnel (enterprise tier) and access by the general public, or authorized users, via a lower tiered application. Is a common interface and client application available across the enterprise tier and the public tier?  Is there licensing or other application costs associated with the client software required by the public?  Describe the GIS functionality that would be available in a public deployed version of the application versus the application that would operate within the USDA enterprise.  Does your product allow for a public version of the application to interact or integrate with data and transaction workflows that have been created or updated by USDA personnel with the enterprise tiered version of the application and how would user authentication occur in this scenario?

9)  CLIENT HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:  The typical USDA user operates a Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP based computer.  Please describe the minimum workstation requirements for the client component of your application including supported operating systems, CPU and RAM requirements, graphics card requirements, hard disk space usage, and screen resolution specifics.  What is the minimum network bandwidth required to the client workstation for your application to operate effectively?  From a client perspective, is the application cross-platform compatible, that is, can the application be deployed in an integrated fashion across different workstation types and operating systems?  For the various operating systems supported, list any additional software components in addition to the base client GES or VG software that is required to be installed, such as web browser software, plugins, applets, and application framework oriented software.

<CONTACT>Lisa Rodriguez Contract Specialist 5052486797     lisa_rodriguez@fws.gov;
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), Region 2, Division of Contracting and General Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico for commercial services prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation is for interpretive panels for Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge located 15 miles from Sherman, Texas as described in the Scope of Work below.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-23 effective  January 25, 2008. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 201818Q004; this solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This procurement action is a total set aside for small business.  The NAICS Code is 541430 Graphic Design Services and size standard is $6.0. STATEMENT OF WORK: 1.0 Significance of Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge The Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge encompasses more than 11,000 acres in Grayson County, located in north-central Texas approximately 15 miles from the City of Sherman (population 31,600). Several small towns are within 60 miles of the Refuge. Dallas, with a population of 1,007,000, is within 75 miles of the Refuge. Including Ft. Worth and the Mid-Cities, more than 2,000,000 people live within 100 miles of the Refuge. The Refuge provides various wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities with wildlife observation and photography being the most popular, followed by fishing. According to traffic counts, the Refuge receives approximately 120,000 visitors a year. The majority of visitors are from nearby locations, though proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex allows for visitors from foreign countries to tour the Refuge. In cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Refuge was established in 1946 on lands purchased by the U.S. Department of the Army for the Denison Dam Project. Strategically situated on the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma, the Refuge provides valuable sanctuary for the natural resources of the Great Plains. The Refuge is located on the Big Mineral Arm of Lake Texoma in a transitional zone between two major vegetational areas known as the Blackland Prairies and the Eastern Cross Timbers where the gently rolling prairies meet the south side of Lake Texoma. The Refuge is located at the heart of a culturally diverse community in rural north-central Texas with increasing influences from the nearby urban areas of Dallas and Forth Worth. The distinct landscape, diversity of biological communities, and secluded location are inherent characteristics that contribute to the area's value as a natural preserve. The Refuge provides a variety of protected habitats for wildlife, open space and nature-oriented recreational activities for the public. The influences of the Blackland Prairies and Eastern Cross Timbers contribute to the diversity of plant species on the Refuge. Stream banks and overflow floodplains support typical bottomland hardwood vegetation. The Blackland Prairies and Eastern Cross Timbers encompass approximately 26,000 square miles in north and central Texas and represent the primary ecological region of northcentral Texas. The Refuge is located within the Central Flyway, a route traveled annually by numerous species of waterfowl and migratory birds. The Refuge enjoys a reputation as a birding mecca in north-central Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the Refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species regularly occur on the Refuge, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory. This northcentral area of Texas has always been a historic waterfowl area. Farming of grain crops, and the availability of small lakes and stock tanks, provided the necessary habitats for migrating birds, especially waterfowl. Today, the Refuge continues to offer food and sanctuary to migratory waterfowl in the fall, winter and spring. The value of these lands that were set aside and dedicated to providing waterfowl habitat, benefit other migratory bird species throughout the year. Each spring and fall sees thousands of shorebirds thronging the mudflats on the lakeshore. Hundreds of wading birds flock to the Refuge to feed on food resources left by falling water levels in late summer. The Refuge's land and water restoration activities are designed and implemented to improve waterfowl habitat, and to benefit more than 270 species of birds, 34 species of mammals, 65 species of reptiles and amphibians and 62 species of fish. While the primary challenges on the Refuge have centered primarily on restoration of habitat for migrating waterfowl, the Refuge also provides habitat for federally listed threatened and endangered species, and several other species of concern, including the least tern (Sterna antillarum), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi), Texas-horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum). 2.0	Interpretive Objectives The majority of visitors to Hagerman NWR will gain an overall understanding of why the refuge was established. The majority of visitors will be introduced to the major ecosystems and ecological processes that affect Hagerman NWR. The majority of visitors will learn the importance of the refuge to migrating and resident bird species and be able to identify a few of the more common and intriguing bird species that utilize the refuge. The majority of visitors will learn the multiple functions of the refuge in managing for wildlife, habitat and public use opportunities. The majority of visitors will be able to recognize from the refuge map, their current location and the locations of other refuge public use areas, attractions, facilities and major landforms. The majority of visitors will understand that Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge is one of over 545 NWR's belonging to the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). The NWRS is the largest national network of lands dedicated to the conservation of America's diverse and abundant wildlife resources and the habitats they depend upon. 3.0	Target Audience and Themes Hagerman NWR attracts approximately 250,000 visitors annually from throughout the country. Reasons for visiting the refuge are varied and include; sportsmen and women seeking hunting and fishing opportunities, wildlife observation (particularly bird-watching), wildlife photography, persons seeking the solitude and aesthetic qualities of nature and those wishing to learn more about the natural resources of the refuge. Most visitors have little or no conservation background, but are interested in a general understanding of the importance of NWR's, specifically Hagerman NWR. Many fail to recognize the difference between NWR's, State wildlife management areas, State parks or National Parks. Themes: 1) Hagerman NWR is a very important area for the conservation of a diverse array of wildlife species and the habitats they depend upon. The refuge's role in conservation will become even more critical as habitat is continually lost, altered and fragmented. The refuge plays an important role in the protection, management and restoration of vital wildlife habitat in the southern Great Plains ecoregion. 2) Hagerman NWR provides the public with opportunities to enjoy and interact with the natural world. As part of its mission, the refuge provides hunting, fishing, bird-watching, wildlife photography and observation, outdoor interpretation and environmental education. Other uses are evaluated individually to determine compatibility with the mission of the refuge and its purpose. 3) Hagerman NWR is also an area with considerable historic significance, steeped in the rich cultural history of pre- and early-statehood Texas and the values and traditions of the Native American tribes inhabiting the area. 4.0	Deliverables The vendor shall furnish all materials, labor, equipment, transportation and professional expertise and other related requirements which are not identified as government provided, necessary to finish five (5) interpretive panels to be installed on the Refuge.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for spacecraft system(s) to support Biological and Biomedical spaceflight research using rodents, cells, and/or other small organisms.  Launch should occur on or about mid-2010 with recovery 30 days thereafter.  The specific timing of the launch and recovery, the dynamics of launch and recovery, and the overall operation of the spacecraft and support infrastructure are to be driven by the scientific requirements of the payload(s). Scientific payloads that will fly within the spacecraft have the following requirements: 1. Ground support systems that include nominally acceptable facilities to provide appropriate animal husbandry, environmental, and life support conditions for animal research.  These requirements apply at a designated host institution, at the spacecraft development site in support of integrated systems tests, and also at the launch site.   2. The facilities must accommodate access to the animal habitats and animals on a daily basis.	 3. Operational capabilities of the spacecraft/launch system at the launch site must include but are not limited to: preparation and installation of samples/equipment into the spacecraft within 72 hours prior to launch (late access); launch capability to orbit and maintain low Earth orbit for 30+ days; in-flight data downlink as required to monitor payload(s) function; in-flight command uplink to control payload(s) function; spacecraft life support systems to fully support the well-being and maintenance of mammalian species for the flight duration to include but not limited to temperature control, atmospheric pressure and humidity control, sea level oxygen content, CO2 and ammonia containment/removal; early access/retrieval of the payload(s) at the landing site to transfer specimens to containers suitable for transportation; and rapid transportation from the landing site to a designated laboratory facility (less than 15 hours from touchdown to payload/sample delivery to labs).	 4. During all phases of pre-, in-, and post-flight operations, power adequate to operate/maintain the payload(s) systems must be provided.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the services from the Russian Space Agency and the Russian Federation State Research Center Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia.	 Neither NASA nor United States industry currently have a recoverable spacecraft that can provide the necessary food, water and life support necessary to sustain rodents and other biological specimens for the projected 30 day mission duration.  There are very few prospects for flying animal experiments of more than 2 week durations on the remaining Space Shuttle flights and research on the International Space Station is especially limited due to the shortage of up and down mass, and crew time.  Further, there is no opportunity for animal research on the International Space Station due to the termination of development of animal habitats and the Life Sciences Glovebox.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 13, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (hereinafter called The University), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a Job Order Contract for general construction services to be performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California. 

This is not a request for quotation.  It is an announcement for subcontracting opportunities with the University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit a prequalification package as indicated below.  


Minimum requirements for general contractors wishing to submit their prequalification documents are:
1) A California contractor's license/classification: B GENERAL BUILDING CONTRACTOR.
2) A satisfactory record of safety performance as evidenced by Workers Compensation Experience Modification (EMR) rates of 1.0 or less in each of the last 3 premium years and by records of recordable incidents.  
3) Sufficient experience with the types of construction services expected to be performed during the subcontract term. 
4)Bonding and insurance capacity sufficient for performance of the subcontract.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK    
A Job Order Contract is an indefinite quantity contract pursuant to which the Subcontractor will perform a series of individual projects at different University facilities operated by the University under the authority of its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy for management and operation of LBNL.   Projects will be priced in accordance with a Construction Task Catalog containing over 150,000 construction tasks with preset unit prices. All unit prices are based on local labor, material and equipment prices including the current prevailing wages. Projects will be performed in accordance with Technical Specifications, which set forth the quality of workmanship and quality of materials required for the construction tasks.

Subcontractors will propose two Adjustment Factors to be applied to the Construction Task Catalog. These Adjustment Factors will apply to each unit price in the Construction Task Catalog.  One Adjustment Factor will be for work performed during normal working hours and the other Adjustment Factor will be for work performed during other than normal working hours.

As projects are identified, the selected Subcontractor will participate in a Joint Scope Meeting, at which the scope of work for the individual project will be explained to the Subcontractor and the Subcontractor will be provided an opportunity to ask questions and inspect the site. The University will then prepare a Detailed Scope of Work and issue a Request for Job Order Proposal to the Subcontractor. The Subcontractor will prepare a Job Order Proposal for the project including, among other items, a Price Proposal and a schedule. In general, the Price Proposal will be prepared by identifying the proper construction tasks from the Construction Task Catalog and multiplying the pre-set unit prices by the quantity required and by the appropriate Multiplier. The University will review the Job Order Proposal and may request changes. When agreement is reached on Job Order Proposal acceptable to both parties, the University will issue a Job Order for the project. 

A separate Job Order will be issued for each project. A Job Order will contain a Detailed Scope of Work, the Project Completion Time, and the price to be paid for the work. The Job Order price shall be a lump sum, fixed price for the completion of the Detailed Scope of Work. 

The estimated annual value of construction services to be performed under the Job Order Contract is $5 to $7 million.  Individual job orders will typically range in value from $25,000 to $250,000 and will rarely exceed $1 million

PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS

The University has determined that general contractors must be prequalified to submit proposals for this project. 
Prequalification will be determined by means of a written questionnaire, which all interested offerors must complete accurately and submit for evaluation by the University, to establish the general contractor's  prequalification status.   Prequalified firms will be invited to submit a comprehensive proposal to include both price and technical evaluation factors.  The University may select more than one firm to perform under a Job Order Contract during the performance period depending upon the performance capacity of the selected firms and the anticipated volume of work at the time of award.

Prequalification documents consisting of this Notice together with the PREQUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE, will be available to intending offerors beginning Jaunary 11, 2008 at the following web site:  http://facilitiesprojects.lbl.gov/.  Prequalification submittals are due back to the University by close of business February 1, 2008.

Any questions or requests for clarification or interpretation of the Prequalification Documents must be submitted in writing to Sharon Ropes, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Rd., M/S 90J0120, Berkeley, CA 94729, fax: (510) 486-6932, e-mail: SARopes@lbl.gov.
Questions must be submitted by January 28, 2008.  Questions received after that date will be answered at the discretion of the University.

Purchase Request: FD2060-07-13397

This contract is critical to the mission support of the F-15 C/D aircraft and shall be solicited in a full & open competitive environment for the First article and options quantities.  The solicitation shall consist of first articles qty: 2 ea; MEQ (mission essential qty): 488 ea; Production Repair Option qty: 248 ea; Out-year Repair Option I qty:  273ea; Out-year Repair Option II qty: 301ea, Out-year Repair Option III qty:  331 ea; Condemnation line item, and data line items NSP.  Numbered notes 8, 22, & 23 applies.  

This acquisition is an INSURANCE BUY and will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ):  
(a) The government has determined that a break in the supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units? mission capability. Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that first article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part. Therefore, the government reserves the right to award the Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ) and, if necessary, the remainder of the requirement to a proven source. In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price-related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives. 

(b) The government shall first determine the apparent successful offeror for the complete quantity under Alternative 1. If offers are received from both proven and unproven sources and it is determined that an unproven source is the apparent low offeror (and is also responsive and responsible), then the prices under Alternative 2 shall be evaluated. Once a decision has been made to progress to Alternative 2, offers under Alternative 1 shall no longer be considered (e.g. the contracting officer shall not compare the proven source?s offer under Alternative 1 and the unproven source?s offer under Alternative 2). If only unproven sources submit offers, Alternative 1 will be used to determine the low offeror and award will be made for that quantity.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for 448 GHz Radiometer. 1.	Itemized Components (Typical) The 448 GHz radiometer is a heterodyne system and includes the following components: Antenna (horn) Mixer, subharmonic Gunn Oscillator, 56 GHz Isolator Doubler 1 Doubler 2 IF amplifier Three band passive filter 2.	Evaluation Criteria (In order of importance) a.	The vendor?s experience in delivering similar systems will be an important factor in order to minimize risk. b.	Size: The radiometer MUST be able to fit within an existing drum and share volume with existing radiometers. There is no allowance for system redesign. Components are mounted on a metal plate, supplied by the customer. c.	Performance: In order to provide the quality of science needed to justify an aircraft flight mission, the performance must meet certain minimum requirements.  d.	Cost e.	Power consumption: Lower power is better, but not at the expense of size, performance or cost. 3.	Documentation: Specifications, operating instructions, operating conditions and limits, and other pertinant information shall be delivered for the components supplied. System and component test results shall also be delivered. 4.	Requirements a.	Packaging The radiometer must fit within a specific volume in order that it be acommodated into an existing drum shaped sensor head containing other radiometers. Some latitude exists for working around a limited number of projections outside the volume such as SMA connectors. The required volume envelope is shown in the attached drawing, and should be considered as a guide rather than a hard requirement.  NOTE: The filter can be located away from the IF amplifier for the 448 radiometer, so need not be included in this volume. b.	System Performance i.	System Noise Temperature: &lt;4200K ii.	Power Balancing: The vendor is responsible for the total system performance. Gunn power must be sufficient to drive the mixer after multiplier conversion, IF amplifier must be sufficient to drive off-the-shelf detectors, etc. c.	Antenna Assembly i.

<DESC>The Joint STARS E-8C aircraft is restructuring the Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) System by implementing a certifiable 8.33/25 kHz VHF Radio for Air Traffic Control (ATC) Voice Radio System capability and a new SINCGARS radio.  This Weapon System Trainers/Navigator Training Systems (WSTs/NTSs) concurrency modification will provide certifiable training for pilots, co-pilots, flight engineers and navigators at Robins AFB, GA.  Implementation of new radios for the E-8Cs has been initiated and will require hardware and software changes in the WSTs/NTSs trainers if currency with the aircraft is to be maintained.  The WSTs/NTSs modification will deliver the required concurrency with the aircraft radios upgrade program and facilitate increased flight training for the E-8C.  Design and build of the radio modification kits will be accomplished at Rockwell Collins, Sterling, VA.  The kits will then be shipped to Robins AFB, GA for installa!  tion and test.  This effort will implement those concurrency changes for the WSTs/NTSs to meet the requirements of AFI 36-2248 and 36-2251.  These AFIs outline the requirements for concurrent trainers and supplements the requirements of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular AC-120-40B/C, Airplane Simulator Qualification.

<DESC>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority(BARDA) intends to purchase the following.  
Following the 2001 anthrax mail attacks, concerns were raised about the availability of pediatric formulations of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline should another anthrax attack occur. Therefore the development of emergency home preparation instructions for pediatric use of these antibiotic drugs began. It was recognized early in the instruction development process that stability, dose uniformity, and palatability data were crucial to the effectiveness of home preparation instructions. For that reason several studies were conducted in support of emergency home preparation instructions. The data from solid oral dosage formulations of doxycycline and ciprofloxacin when mixed with various household food and drinks were tested and evaluated. Each drug mixed with food/drink was rated for palatability; however, absolute palatability for each mixture was not measured. As a result of these initial studies, there is also interest in determining how home preparation instructions could be a viable component of a home MedKit for personal stockpiling purposes.
 In light of these laboratory studies, CDER posted doxycycline emergency home preparation instructions for anthrax prophylaxis on its external website in 2002. These instructions were intended to assist the layperson during an emergency in taking solid oral dosage forms of doxycycline and converting them to child-friendly, liquid oral dosage forms using commonly-available household materials. In 2005, it was decided by the CDC working group that the instructions that were developed from this 2001 initiative were to be included as a component of the Medkits. 

The purpose of this acquisition is to identify commercial entities capable of designing and performing food palatability studies to mask the bitter taste of doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, and capable of evaluating home preparation instructions acceptability of these drugs, in terms of delivery of dose. The final objective of the palatability studies should be the identification of foods, pharmaceutical flavoring additives and/or instruction procedures that will most successfully mask the unpleasant taste of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline solid oral dosage forms intended to be used in pediatric, dysphagic, and elderly populations.
The final objective for the home preparation studies should be to evaluate performance of the home preparation instructions when performed in a household by laypersons.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item/service using FAR Part 12.

It is anticipated that one contract for food palatability studies to mask the bitter taste of doxycycline and ciprofloxacin and for studies evaluating home preparation instructions will be awarded. However, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards. RFP-BARDA-08-12 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about February 8, 2008. Responses will be due on or about March 8, 2008. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP-BARDA-08-12 and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice.

<DESC>GLP Radionuclide/Radiation Animal Models and Resources Development
RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BARDA-08-20
Formerly Announced as RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BARDA-08-09.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.
Description 
Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues.  The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents.  There is a need for the continued development of decorporation agents.

The Offeror will provide the required services including the following: development of an information base and rodent and non-rodent animal models of internal radionuclide contamination, development of rodent and non-rodent screen and efficacy evaluation animal models, and GLP-compliant radionuclide exposure facilities.  The animal models that are to be developed are intended to support future GLP pivotal animal efficacy studies with an eventual goal of supporting licensure of decorporation agents or other treatments of radionuclide internal contamination.
The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by the NIAID Contracts Office through a mechanism called work assignments.  The Government intends to establish contracts for two facilities to carry out the efforts described above.
Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals.  Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy.  The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.  Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

It is anticipated that two work assignment type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.35 FTEs. 

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about January 3, 2008 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  

This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

FUJIFILM Medical Systems USA, Inc. is the only source capable of fulfilling the government?s requirement as this particular system marries up with the equipment that is currently in use (FUJI computed radiography) at Patrick AFB, FL.  The CRm will integrate with the Synapse software which is already in place as well.  Additionally, the facility is already configured with a digital printer that is postured to print mammograms.  This equipment was postured during the Computed Radiography installation in June 2007.  FUJI Medical Systems USA, Inc. is the only company that currently manufactures a computed radiography digital cassette/plate system that is accepted by the Air Force.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3845 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334510.  The non-manufacturer rule applies to this requirement since the sole source is a large business manufacturer for the referenced NAICS code.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  45 CONS/LGCB has determined that FUJIFILM Medical Systems USA, Inc. is the only source capable of providing this requirement.  Phone calls will not be accepted.  Point of contact is Bonnie Pruett, Contract Specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H. White II, Street MS7200, Patrick AFB, FL  32925,  bonnie.pruett@patrick.af.mil

NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk AUR missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Francis S. Gabreski Airport, Long  Island (Westhampton Beach), NY, to the Long island Power Authority.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  The Long Islan d Power Authority (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependabl e service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The ANGB at Francis S. Gabreski Airport is located in Long Island (Westh ampton Beach), New York, approximately 80 miles east of New York City.  It is home to the 106th Rescue Wing which operates HC-130 Hercules and HH-60G Pavehawk helicopters to provide war and peacetime aerial rescue services.  The base encompasses 88 acres a nd contains 34 buildings; 32 Industrial and 2 Services, amounting to approximately 311,000 square feet. There is no family or transient housing.  The day-to-day base population is approximately 250 personnel; however, one weekend each month the population surges to 826 in response to Air National Guard drills.  Power is supplied to the ANGB at Francis S Gabreski Airport, NY through a 13.2 kilovolt (kV) overhead distribution line that enters the base via a pole and master meter (owned by the Long Island Powe r Authority) located at the main gate on Old Riverhead Road.  The distribution system consists of approximately 900 linear feet underground and 9,800 linear feet overhead of transmission lines, 30 three phase transformers ranging from 37.5 to 530 kilovolt amps (kVA),  eight single phase transformers ranging from 5 kVA to 75 kVA and 74 utility poles.  The underground secondary service lines are in conduit.  There are two primary underground feeds, both with manhole access.  The system is a conventional simpl e-radial distribution system with lateral branches and dates back to 1968.  The system was upgraded extensively throughout the 1986-1996 period.  Base personnel indicate the current system capacity is adequate and sufficient to meet the planned expansion o f base facilities.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and one unacceptable offer was received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and  negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your  understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience op erating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact Fred Rodriguez, fred.rodriguez@nysuff.ang.af.mil, (631) 723-756 2.  <BR>Original Point of Contact<BR>Fred Rodriguez, fred.rodriguez@nysuff.ang.af.mil, (631) 723-7562.  <BR><BR>Places of Performance<BR>            Location:    106th RQW, Air National Guard Base, Francis S.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) primary mission is to provide timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture.  NASS? primary function is to administer USDA?s Statistical Estimating Program, conduct the five year Census of Agriculture, coordinate Federal/State agricultural statistical needs, perform statistical consulting services for external customers and to conduct statistical research.  

The Spatial Analysis Research Section (SARS) of NASS? Research and Development Division annually produces remote sensing based acreage estimates at the state and county level for major commodities grown in the United States.  The remote sensing based estimates are considered as an unbiased and independent input into the official NASS Crop Report.  SARS produces these estimates by creating an agricultural specific land use classification called the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) using satellite imagery that is released into the public domain after the growing season is complete.  SARS produces the CDL supervised classification using ground truth collected from farmer reported data and ancillary datasets relating to land use/land cover in the program.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has the stated mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease, a burden borne by every age group, by every segment of society, by people all over the world.  Within this mission falls gene discovery. Gene discovery elucidates the cause of some diseases, and also, the underlying pathogenesis of related disorders.  Genetic studies of neurological disorders are increasing in number and complexity.  Such studies require a large and diverse sample and accompanying information base.  The NINDS Human Genetics Repository, established in 2002 via contract with the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, receives, stores, and distributes DNA, Cell Lines, and accompanying clinical and genotypic data to the Neuroscience community.  The resultant contract from this re-competition will build upon the existing infrastructure to support and encourage gene discovery, serving the mission of NINDS.  The current collection consists of over 16,000 genetic samples.  An additional 20,000 to 30,000 samples from unique individuals are expected to be collected under the new contract over a five year period.  The Repository acts in a service capacity to facilitate the goals and specific scientific aims of NINDS grantees and other scientists studying neurological disorders.  Ongoing collection, curation, and distribution will allow collection of a sample set that is large enough to discover common genetic risk factors for neurological disorders.  It will also ensure that a standardized, useful dataset of demographic, other phenotypic, and genotypic data is shared via a project-specific website and other such resources such as the National Library of Medicine?s database of genotype and phenotype (DbGaP) in accordance with NIH policy on shared resources.  Personnel with established expertise in DNA preparation, lymphoblast immortalization/cell line preparation, data management and database design, power analysis/statistical support for genetic studies, and biological materials receipt, storage and distribution will be needed to perform this project.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of five years in September 2008.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).  THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WILL BE ISSUED ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 24, 2008.  The RFP will be made electronically only and will be available at http://www.fbo.gov (FedBizOpps website).  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking the FedBizOpps website for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency (full and open competition).  Refer to Numbered Note 26.

The HBM has been developed by Ansoft (with the help of a medical institute) and it is not commercially available on their product portfolio. NIST was informed about this product through interaction with the participants at the IEEE802.15.6 international standardization group. In conjunction with the human body model, HFSS is also needed to run simulation for Radio Frequency propagation studies inside human body. There are no other sources with similar products that can be used for our project.

The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $23.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price type purchase Ansoft corporation for this requirement.

Interested parties that are authorized by Ansoft to sell the aforementioned Ansoft  software licenses may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to maria.gray@nist.gov.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only. NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting capabilities information from certified 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns within a five state region consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas for the construction of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Avionics and Integration Laboratory (CAIL) at JSC. The purpose of this request is to determine the appropriate level of competition in accordance with FAR 19.10  Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Information received will be used to make a determination regarding the use of full and open competition or to set aside the procurement as an 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOSB set-aside.  It is the potential offeror?s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. It is anticipated the NASA/JSC will issue a solicitation for a General Construction contract for the renovation of Building 29 for CAIL. The NAICS code for the project is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 million. This NAICS code ties directly with FAR 19 of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, under the title of Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.	The magnitude of the project is more that $10,000,000 as set forth in FAR 36.204 Disclosure of the Magnitude of Construction Projects. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.   The project will refurbish and rehabilitate the existing Building 29 which currently houses the BioPlex and various other small labs.  When completed, the CAIL will be 59,000 square feet of administrative, laboratory, support facilities and work areas.  The CAIL will be the test facility where avionics, other flight hardware (or simulations of hardware), flight software, flight procedures, and ground support equipment are brought together for integrated verification testing of CEV Avionics.  This testing encompasses avionic subsystems of the CEV operation in a real time environment.  The facility refurbishment will renovate the entire facility by gutting the entire interior of most walls, all ceilings, floor finishes, the training pool, the BioPlex modules, crane systems, mechanical systems, fire protection systems, security systems, electrical systems and plumbing systems as well as the rotunda roof.  The demolition will involve some asbestos removal as well as removal and working with lead contaminated paint on existing areas of the facility.   The renovation will include new walls, floor finishes, ceilings, mechanical systems, plumbing systems, fire protection systems, security systems, electrical systems and a rotunda roof	with new structural floor systems to provide additional space required by the CAIL.	 The refurbishment may be required to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) accreditation for refurbishment work as established by the U.S. Green Building Council.  Certified 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB General Construction Companies capable of performing as prime contractors that meet the requirements of this synopsis are asked to submit capability statements in no more than seven (7) pages.	Material submitted shall not contain binding of any kind or be submitted in hard or soft folders. Capability statements must include the following information: ?	Name and address of firm  ?	Size of business ?	Average annual revenue for past 3 years ?	Number of employees ?	Ownership ?	Indicate company status as either Certified 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB ?	Number of years in business ?	Affiliate information:	parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, etc? ?	CAGE Code (if available) In addition, capability statements must address the following: 1) Capability statements should identify past projects with proven General Construction experience within the last five (5) years with emphasis on work performed on a Federal installation and include three (3) references.	These references must highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, a point of contact - address and phone numbers. 2) Ability to meet the 15% requirement of work to be performed by the prime contractor, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees as set forth in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Provide examples of three (3) past projects with emphasis on work performed on a Federal installation where the potential offeror has performed 15% or greater of the effort for similar projects with a magnitude of more than $10,000,000.  The provided examples are to indicate that the potential offeror is capable of performing the primary and vital functions of the contract in accordance with the Ostensible Subcontractor Rule, 13 C.F.R. 121.103(h)(4)(2005).   NOTE:  Projects that satisfy the requirements of both items 1 and 2 of the synopsis only need to be submitted once. 3) Identify any OSHA violations within the last 3 years, specifically injury or death related. Also provide disposition of any OSHA violations.  If no violations have occurred, please so state; 4) Ability to meet Bonding Capacity of 100 percent of the contract price as per FAR 52.228-15.  Capability statement must demonstrate bonding capacity for the magnitude of the project which is more than $10,000,000. 5) Experience with new construction, partial or total renovations, or major refurbishment of a facility similar in size and scope in a work environment with special access requirements, and ?restricted? periods of time when work can be performed;  6) Experience involving a broad range of skills, including, but not limited to site work, paving, utilities, structures, electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems, finishes, furnishing/outfitting, carpentry; 7) Experience in managing and coordinating subcontractors to perform electrical, mechanical, civil, structural, and other specialty type work required to complete contractual requirements of projects.  This should include qualified project managers and superintendents familiar with construction. 8) Experience in construction of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) projects.  Companies should include samples of any involvement on projects that required energy efficient general construction practices that would meet the U. S. Green Building Council LEED certification requirements and NASA requirements for sustainable building design as mandated by NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 8820.3.  This directive requires incorporation of sustainable design principles to the maximum extent possible to reduce life-cycle costs, implement pollution-prevention principles, and maximize facility impacts on natural resources while maximizing occupant health, safety, and productivity.  LEED is the primary implementation methodology to facilitate this initiative at JSC.  The lack of experience with LEED does not exclude companies from reponding to this sources sought.  NASA/JSC is interested in responses from companies that are willing to invest and develop their expertise in LEED capability. 9)  Knowledge of and experience with Government construction regulations and OSHA safety standards (Government Safety and Health Plans);  10) Experience in developing safety and health plans including the ability to comply with the JSC Total Safety and Health Handbook located at http://jschandbook.jsc.nasa.gov	  			. It is the potential offerors responsibility to review the entire content of the JSC Safety and Health requirements. The following general information is offered to provide an idea of the JSC Safety and Health requirements. Potential offerors should understand that if selected for award of a JSC contract, they will be responsible for performing tasks to ensure the protection of personnel, property, equipment, and the environment in contractor products and activities generated in support of institutional and space flight program objectives. In addition, to ensure compliance with pertinent NASA policies and requirements and federal, state, and local regulations for safety, health, environmental protection, and fire protection, the contractor will be required to develop and implement a safety and health program in accordance with a NASA-approved safety and health plan. The contractor will implement system safety engineering tasks for flight and institutional program activities and products in accordance with the schedule and applicable flight and institutional requirements as documented in the contractor?s System Safety Program Plans (SSPPs) which must be approved by NASA.

The purpose of this market research (Source Sought Synopsis) is to determine at what level adequate competition is available.  The place of performance for this requirement will be at Avon Park Air Force Range, Avon Park, FL.  

Specifications (These specifications are not meant to be definitive, but represent in summary form, the general areas to be supported.):

The contractor shall furnish all supervision, licenses, field inspection, labor, materials, and equipment, necessary to eradicate exotic vegetation.  There are a total of 628 acres that will require some level of herbicide application.  Treatments shall be performed in accordance with industry standards as identified on the Florida Department of Environment Protection and University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) web sites.  All herbicides used must be Department of Defense approved for use and label approved for the target species.  The Contractor is to provide copies of Material Safety Data Sheets of all herbicides at least 15 days prior to start of work.  The Contractor shall adhere to all Federal, State, County and local regulations governing the application, transportation, storage, use, and disposal of products utilized in the performance of this contract.  The contractor shall possess Florida State Certification in Forestry (category 2) or Natural Area Weed Management (category 21).  A State Certified Applicator must maintain line-of-site supervision of any uncertified technicians at all times.  Contractor is prohibited from aerial application of herbicides.  Herbicides shall be applied with hand held sprayers or wands to minimize over-spray.  Florida Statutes require the use of aquatic herbicide over open water.  Most of these infestations have been treated in the past with herbicide, therefore population density per acre of invasive exotic plant species is reduced.  Our objective is to control or limit growth of nonnative plant life.  Acceptable control techniques include, but are not limited to, contact herbicide, cut stump treatment, Frill-and-Girdle, Basal Bark, and broadleaf control.  Work will be scheduled around military mission activities.  The impact areas are usually closed each year during January and February for target maintenance.  Contractor shall schedule all work in active target areas during these months.  The contractor shall commence treatment requests within 48 hours from receipt of request, excluding holidays and weekends.

Currently, quality measures and data collection methods and items are segregated by the health care setting in which they represent or affect.

Additionally, the maintenance, development, research and testing work conducted only applies to the setting in which the instrument was developed.  This silo approach has led to a multitude of health and quality monitoring methodologies across settings and challenges the ability to view health and quality across time; throughout the entire continuum of care.

Group 2:  Implementation: Includes activities described in Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12 of the SOW.  CMS anticipates that this section could be performed by small business.

You are encouraged to also submit SOW questions and comments.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints, CMS will not be able to respond to questions and comments submitted.

<SUBJECT>Navy Enterprise Resource Planning at SPAWAR HQ and all SPAWAR System Centers
<DESC>Dear Industry Partner, In April 2008, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM) and its associated System Centers in San Diego, New Orleans, Charleston and Norfolk, will be implementing a new information system called Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (Navy ERP) that replaces several of our legacy systems. Navy ERP is an integrated business management system that modernizes and standardizes Navy business operations, provides unprecedented management visibility across the enterprise, and increases effectiveness and efficiency. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is the generic name of a software-based management system used by forward-thinking corporations around the world to power their crucial business functions. The Navy ERP Program uses a product from SAP Corporation, the largest provider of ERP solutions in the world. As one of our industry partners, you may have personnel who require access to information that is currently held by a legacy application/systems which is being replaced with Navy ERP. Federal statues and regulations require procedures to be in place to provide for trusted access to government information systems. In order to implement these requirements, a new SPAWAR contract clause is forthcoming. Once the clause has been approved for distribution, all SPAWARSYSCOM contracts that will require ERP access for Contractor personnel will be modified to incorporate the new clause(s) and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) requirement. The new contract clause will require contractor personnel who require access to Government systems in the course of their work to submit a System Authorization Access Request (SAAR) (DD 2875) to work in Navy ERP, along with their annual Information Assurance (IA) training certificate as completed on our mandatory training site or on Navy Knowledge Online (NKO). Your employees do not need a security clearance for access to Navy ERP. If your contract employees currently hold a security clearance, we will be able to verify that trust in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). If your employee does not currently hold a security clearance, you or your Facilities Security Officer must have the employee initiate a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) (or provide proof of a current one), and enter that information in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). If your company does not currently hold a security clearance, you may bring your completed SF 85P forms for your employees to the SPAWAR applicable site Security Manager. All contractor personnel, cleared or not, must complete, sign and date Part I of the SAAR System Authorization Access Request(SAAR)(DD 2875) (SAAR form can be access from our SPAWAR E-Commerce Website - see below) and provide it to the Contracting Officers representative or NMCI Alternate Customer Technical Rep (ACTR). All contractor personnel, cleared or not, must complete SPAWAR required annual Information Assurance training located on Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) website. Print out the certificate of training and provide it to your Contracting Officers Representative and the NMCI ACTR. Questions on this new contract requirement may be directed to: At SPAWAR HQ, San Diego, CA  Mr. Ken Kennedy, SPAWAR Contracts Policy, at e-mail: Ken.Kennedy@navy.mil At SSC San Diego, CA- Ms. Faye Esaias, Contracting Officer, at e-mail: Faye.Esaias@navy.mil At SSC Charleston - Ms. Donna Murphy, Chief Operating Officer at e-mail: donna.murphy@navy.mil.

Customers will also be able to limit their cross searching to humans, in English, priority journals, priority journals with abstracts, animals, search by the date the records were added to the system and dedup retrieval sets. We require the ability of customers to establish unlimited ?alerts? on various topics and have the results emailed to them by registering for a password. 

Customers are able to quickly navigate to the full-text of articles based on the electronic journals the FDA Biosciences Library subscribes to annually. 

Access is 24/7 for Agency staff.

3.1  
Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient manner for FDA researchers by saving of overall search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work necessary to meet the mission of FDA.  

The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.

3.2  Deliverables:

5.  Payment
Payment will be made only after satisfactory completion of concrete deliverables/service (i.e. access is available agency-wide via a static URL - IP access). 
Payment will be made in two installments. The first will be made once access has been established for the first 3 months and the second payment will include the remaining nine months. Contractor will submit two invoices that include the requirements listed below.  Funding is currently only available for the initial payment, therefore, the second payment is subject to FAR Clause, 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. 
Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.
b.  the FDA is being provided access to the resource

7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

3.2.1 Ideally the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms in order to meet the needs of FDA researchers and save the Agency researchers search time (through one search query across the single platform) in order for researchers to perform the work in a timely manner to meet the mission of FDA. 

If a plug-in, additional software or recommended software is required for optimal use, please include specific requirements. Contractor will address any questions or problems encountered when using this product with supported software or hardware.
The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The format of the usage statistics is provided either via email or contractor provided login and should include database, sessions, searches, abstracts, html, and pdf.

4.  Period of Performance
Contract will commence on the date the contractor receives notification of award from the Office of Acquisitions and Grants. It will run for 12 months post date of award notification. 

5.  Payment
Payment will be made only after satisfactory completion of concrete deliverables/service (i.e. access is available agency-wide via a static URL - IP access). 
Payment will be made in installments. The first will be made once access has been established for the first 3 months and other payments will include the remaining subscription. Pursuant to FAR 52.232-18, Availability of Funds, funding is only available for the initial payment.
Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.
b.  the FDA is being provided access to the resource 

6.  Deliverables

6.1 	Products to be delivered via email or mail
6.2	Static URL, password information (if necessary), product training, technical support numbers, account number, promotional materials, monthly usage statistics


7.  Place of Delivery or Performance
 
7.1  The products provided shall be hosted by the contractor server, but will be available via the Library?s intranet page, agency-wide.


8  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.

(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium:

? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.           Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

Background:

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a large laboratory facility that owns and operates a heavy water moderated nuclear test reactor surrounded by a suite of instruments and several neutron guides that lead into an associated guide hall research facility. The combined research facility is used to perform a broad array of state-of-the-art Biology, Materials, Chemistry, and Physics research by measuring the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties.  Some of the research performed at the NCNR is fundamental in nature, other research is directly applicable to problems of immediate societal interest.
The NCNR is expanding its research facility with four new Neutron Research Beamlines. In order for this to happen the existing Guide Hall needs to expand.  An 80? x 200? addition is planned to accommodate the new Beam Lines. One of the new instruments that will be located in the new guide hall will be a Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR).  The CANDOR instrument will be located at the end of the NG-1 guide tube and will utilize the full guide cross-section (6 cm wide by 15 cm high). Goniometers are required to move and manipulate the sample stage for the CANDOR instrument.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

Title:  Services Related to Cryptographic Modules Operating in Constrained Environments



I.	BACKGROUND

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3:  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules is currently under development by the Computer Security Division.  This document will provide a standard to be used by Federal agencies and departments when these organizations specify that cryptographic-based security systems are to be used to provide protection for sensitive or valuable data.  The standard specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive but unclassified information, referred to as sensitive information.  Protection of a cryptographic module within a security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information protected by the module Cryptographic-based security systems may be utilized in various computer and telecommunication applications (e.g., data storage, access control and personal identification, network communications, radio, facsimile, and video) and in various environments (e.g. centralized computer facilities, office environments, and hostile environments).  FIPS 140-3 serves as an umbrella standard for all cryptographic based standards and guidelines developed by the Computer Security Division including those related to Personal Identity Verification (PIV), smart cards, wireless security, and security of modules with reduced memory and power capabilities.  Analysis of the existing initial FIPS 140-3 draft with respect to these issues is required.
	Knowledge of reference implementation and testing of PIV interfaces based on SP 800-73 and conformance testing derived from SP 800-85A and 800-85B and of biometrics authentication is also required.
	FIPS 140-3, SP 800-73, SP 800-85A and SP 800-85B serve as the bases for technical requirements for laboratory accreditation under the Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratory Accreditation Program (LAP), initially named Cryptographic Module Testing (CMT), was established by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) to accredit laboratories that perform cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic modules validation conformance testing, PIV testing, General Services Administration (GSA) Precursor FIPS testing, and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) testing.
	Because of the importance of the work of these accredited laboratories to NIST ITL?s Computer Security Division, a new Accreditation Group has been formed to coordinate and consolidate the collaborations required among and between NVLAP, the laboratories, the CAVP, CMVP, NPIVP, GSAP and SCAP Validation Programs, and other customers and stakeholders.

II.	SCOPE OF WORK

One of the purposes of this effort is the development of test methods, accreditation requirements, and technical guidance as related to cryptographic modules operating in constrained environments, with low power/low memory (smartcards), and/or utilizing wireless technology.  This effort is a direct follow-on to previous work (SB1341-05-C-0029) in the development of NIST?s FIPS 140-3:  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and strategies for the revision to NIST Handbook 150-17:  Cryptographic Module Testing.  This effort will require an extensive understanding of our existing tools, standards, and test methods (NIST Handbook 150-17:  Cryptographic Module Testing).
	Another purpose of this effort is to add additional refinements to NIST Handbook 150-17, its checklists, proficiency tests, and on-site assessments.  This effort is a direct follow-on to previous work (SB1341-07-SE-1007).  As the number of accredited laboratories grows, the effort to maintain the validation programs within ITL grows without additional personnel.  Many efficiencies can be incorporated to save consultation, preparation, and on-site time of the ITL in-house experts.
	Additionally, a thorough understanding is required of (1) cryptographic based test methods as related to NIST?s PIV program; (2) wireless 802.11b ad-hoc network security as related to FIPS 140-3; and (3) cryptographic based security for low power/low memory devices as related to NIST?s FIPS 140-3.  The output from the effort will be additional refinements of NIST Handbook 150-17, its checklists, its web interfaces and its use by ITL experts in their assessments of CST laboratories.  All of this work will incorporate the new concepts from FIPS 140-3 and advances in the technologies of PIV, wireless and modules with reduced memory and power capabilities.

III.	Specific Tasks

Tasks

1)	The Contractor shall provide the analysis of NIST Handbook 150-17:  ?Cryptographic Module Testing Laboratory Accreditation? for consistency and operational coherence as well as additions and modifications to support validation of cryptographic modules related to PIV, wireless security, and security of modules with reduced memory and power capabilities, SCAP testing, and interrelationships of PIV hardware and software to biometric identity systems.  (NIST Handbook 150-17 is used to determine compliance to FIPS 140-2 and its successor FIPS 140-3 and it provides criteria for the accreditation of Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories by NVLAP.)
2)	The Contractor shall develop additional refinements of NIST Handbook 150-17 based on the analysis.  The new version provides greater granularity in the scopes of accreditation, and specification of tools required for testing.  It needs a mechanism for dynamic updating through web-based annexes (see Task 4 below).  The update of the Handbook will include requirements for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) test suites and should also permit easy coordination with new biometric LAPs being developed.
3)	The Contractor shall provide expertise and assistance in the development and implementation of proficiency testing for GSA and SCAP test methods before, during and after on-site assessments for the Cryptographic and Security Testing Laboratory Accreditation Program.
4)	The Contractor shall test the feasibility of first providing radio-button links in web pages to references, handbooks, checklist, etc. for labs to use when applying for accreditation.  The Contractor shall then test the feasibility of dynamically updating existing test methods, updating references, modifying checklists, and providing samples of quizzes and proficiency tests online.

As such, they are not a mandatory requirement of the contract, but may be provided by the offeror.

QUESTION 10:	Location:  Business Opportunity & Proposal Package Letter to Director Item #6 Topic:  PI If the current contract holder does not agree with the Park Service's assessment of $0.00 of possessory interest, will the burden of going to arbitration regarding the amount of possessory interest due the current contract holder be put on the winning offeror? NPS Response to Question 10:  The National Park Service has settled Possessory (PI) Interest with the concessioner.  The PI due the incumbent from successful offeror is $0.00. QUESTION 11:			Location:  Proposal Instructions, Page 6		Topic:  Org Structure  What is definition of "3rd party agreement"?

QUESTION 14:		Location:  Proposal Package, Page 13, Subfactor 4b2g	Topic:  Org Structure The Prospectus indicates that a management fee/OH assessment is permissible, yet it also states that a Management Agreement is not allowed (Instructions p.6).  Please define how a "management fee" is permissible.  And what is NOT permissible in terms of Parent/subsidiary bookkeeping?    NPS Response to Question 14: The National Park Service requires the provision of the required and authorized services be accomplished by the party that enters into the concession contract. Support services can be provided to the concessioner under a management agreement for which a management fee is charged. Such agreement and associated costs and fees should be clearly stated and evident in the response to the organizational structure as well as on the financial statements to be provided in the Proposal Package.  QUESTION 15:		Location:  Proposal Package, Page 13, Item g	Topic:  Management Fee The Prospectus states that a Management Agreement is not permissible, so is a "Management Fee" allowed as noted in "item g"? NPS Response to Question 15: The National Park Service requires the provision of the required and authorized services be accomplished by the party that enters into the concession contract. Support services can be provided to the concessioner under a management agreement for which a management fee is charged.

NPS Response to Question 16: The items mentioned in the Draft Contract are sample projects relating to both golf and non-golf facilities that are non - recurring within a seven year time frame. As such they would be eligible for consideration for the use of the Repair and Maintenance Reserve. However, as stated in Section 9. (c)  (5) no projects completed with the Repair and Maintenance Reserve will be eligible for LSI.   QUESTION 17:		Location:  Proposal Package, PSF5				Topic:  Scoring It is specified that subfactors are weighted evenly unless otherwise noted.  Please confirm that the Franchise fee and the R&M Reserve are each valued at "2" points each? If not, what weight is given to each? NPS Response to Question 17: Information on the scoring for Principal Selection Factor 5 is provided in the Proposal Package Instructions. QUESTION 18:			Location:  Operating Plan, Page A-12, 6A3		Topic:  Staff For Head pro position, NPS states that the individual must be active in PGA.  Is this suggesting that LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association) and USGTF (United States Golf Teachers Federation) credentials do not meet the minimum requirement? NPS Response to Question 18: No.  The National Park Service has requested that the professional resumes be provided as part of Principal Selection Factor 3, Subfactor3b. The National Park Service will consider qualifications of various nationally recognized professional associations under this category and determine if the Operating Plan should be altered to identify other credentialing organizations. QUESTION 19:			Location:  Operations Plan Page A-18 8 C2		Topic:  R&M Monthly, concessioner will report on previous months R&M reserve deposit, including a copy of the wire transfer identifying the account and amount transferred.

However, the Concession Contract Section 9 (1) outlines the types of projects that Repair and Maintenance Reserve funds can be used for, while Section 9(5) includes requirements for projects that these funds cannot be used for.  QUESTION 21:					Location:  Maintenance Plan		Topic:  R&M Can the R&M fund be used for projects or purchases that would require capitalization under IRS rules? NPS Response to Question 21:  As stated in Section 9 (c) (1), the Repair and Maintenance Reserve fund can be used on projects that are non-recurring within a seven year period. How a concessioner chooses to identify these projects for tax purposes based upon IRS rules is the concessioner's determination. The NPS will be responsible for determining if a proposed project is a major rehabilitation and if said project is, the Repair and Maintenance Reserve funds shall not be used. QUESTION 22:					Location:  Maintenance Plan		Topic:  R&M Can projects or purchases that would normally be considered possessory interest items be made using the R&M fund? NPS Response to Question 22: Section 9 (c) (5) of the Contract indicates that the Concessioner shall obtain no LSI as a consequence of the expenditure of Repair and Maintenance Reserve funds. QUESTION 23:					Location:  Maintenance Plan		Topic:  R&M Can new structures be built using the R&M fund? NPS Response to Question 23: New structures cannot be built with the Repair and Maintenance Reserve funds.

QUESTION 25:					Location:  Maintenance Plan		Topic:  R&M Can the concessioner contribute additional capital to R&M projects if R&M reserves are not sufficient to cover the expense of a project? NPS Response to Question 25: The Concessioner can contribute additional capital to Repair and Maintenance Reserve projects in addition to funds from the Repair and Maintenance Reserve Fund.  The concessioner will not receive LSI credit for these additional funds based on the project guidelines found on the Draft Contract and 36CFR Part 51.  At any time the Concessioner may fund additional improvements and agree to waive LSI, with prior approval of the Service QUESTION 26:					Location:  Maintenance Plan		Topic:  R&M Can the Park Service dictate R&M fund projects or purchases without approval of the concessioner? NPS Response to Question 26: Section 3 C) (2) of the Draft Contract and Exhibit H (Maintenance Plan) to the Draft Contract outline the process for developing the Repair and Maintenance Reserve plan and indicates how the NPS will review and provide feedback on the plan.  QUESTION 27:					Location:  Maintenance Plan		 Irrigation should be conducted where irrigation is available.  How many irrigation heads does each property have by tee, fairway, green? NPS Response to Question 27: Rock Creek Golf Course has approximately 80 irrigation heads on the greens and approximately 40 on the tees.  The fairways are not irrigated.

QUESTION 31:			Location:  Maintenance Plan		Topic:	 Is it the Park Service's assessment that large scale capital improvement in the courses is not necessary? NPS Response to Question 31: The National Park Service has evaluated its options for development within the course of the contract term and has not included a required capital improvement project program.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 8 FEB 2008, 5:00 P.M.

Justification for Brand Name Product or Feature Unique to a Single Manufacturer

1.       The OCCs requirement described in Requisition 84022 requires a particular brand name product or feature for reasons indicated below:

2.       Restricted to the following brand name: Symantec Backup Exec.       

3.       Description of the brand name, product or feature unique to a single manufacturer:
The following products are required based on the OCCs current disaster recovery infrastructure.     
a. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Agent for Windows System     W/Symantec Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows Servers and CPA-Essential Support     1 server 

b. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Agent for Microsoft SQL Server - W/Symantec Backup Exec Agent for Windows Systems - Essential Support (1 year) - 1 Server 

c. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Library Expansion Option Essential Support (1 year) - 1 drive 

d. Symantec Backup Exec l1d for Windows Servers Agent for Microsoft Exchange Server W/ Symantec Backup Exec Agent for Windows Systems - Essential Support (1 year) - 1server 

e. Symantec Backup Exec11d for Windows Servers Intelligent Disaster Recovery Option -Essential Support (1 year) - unlimited clients 

f.  Symantec Backup Exec 11D WIN w/ continuous Protection Server STD

g. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers SAN Shared Storage Option-Essential Support (1 year) - 1 server 

h. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Central Admin Server Option - Essential Support (1 year) - 1 server 

i. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Advanced Open File Option     W/Symantec Backup Exec Agent for Windows Systems - Essential Support (1 year) - 1 Server 


j. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Agent for Windows Systems     W/Symantec Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows Servers and CPA- Essential Support (1 year) - 1 server 


k. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Agent for Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server     W/ Symantec Backup Exec Agent for Windows Systems - Essential Support (1 year) - 1 server - 

l. Symantec Backup Exec 11d for Windows Servers Remote Agent for NetWare Servers - Essential Support (1 year) - 1 server 
       
4.       Specific salient characteristics of the brand name, product or feature that are required to satisfy the Agency?s needs: 

a. This is the only brand name that can fulfill the Agency?s needs since the Agencys developed its disaster recovery infrastructure around the Symantec (Veritas / Seagate) Backup Exec since 1997.     As a result, the only product compatible to the OCC infrastructure is Symantec Backup Exec.     This structure allows the Agency the capability to protect applications, user data and operating system files throughout the enterprise.     

5.       Describe the market research that was performed.     What other similar products or features of products available from other companies were considered and why are the similar products or features unable to satisfy the Agencys needs.     

a. The product must be able to interconnect with an existing system/infrastructure and only Symantec Backup Exec provides the form, fit, and function compatibility based on a review of interface information of all commercially available similar products.     This is based on information provided by knowledgeable individuals in the Government regarding market capabilities to meet requirements. 


I have reviewed the circumstances of this justification for a brand name product or feature unique to a single manufacturer and certify that item required meets the Governments minimum needs and no other course of action will satisfy the Governments requirement.

Technical Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this Brand Name Justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Program Manager:       SIGNATURE: /s/ Paul Marshman 1/24/08
