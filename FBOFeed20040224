All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

APA will evaluate, validate, and benchmark the data assimilation capacity of NASA Earth Observing Systems (EOS) data in the LBCS-DSS. NASA/SSC intends to purchase the services from the American Planning Association of Chicago, Illinois.  A Recommendation and Determination to Solicit Only One Source is included in the file. The Statement of Work is as follows: 1.0	Background The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) National Application Strategy serves to enhance decision support systems (DSSs) of national interest and utility with NASA Earth science measurements.  These measurements, comprising data from as many as 18 Earth-viewing satellites, may enhance the capacity for DSSs in community growth. This data infusion is accomplished using a systems engineering approach comprising three phases: evaluation, verification and validation (V&V), and benchmarking.   The American Planning Association’s (APA) Land-Based Classification Standards (LBCS) provide a consistent model for classifying land uses based on their characteristics. The standards are based on a multi-dimensional land-use classification model. It replaces the 1965 Standard Land Use Coding Manual, a standard which was widely adopted for land-use classifications by local, regional, state, and federal agencies.  The model extends the notion of classifying land uses by refining traditional land-use categories into multiple dimensions, such as activities, functions, building types, site development character, and ownership constraints. Each dimension has its own set of categories and subcategories. These multiple dimensions allow users to have precise control over land-use classifications and provide local communities (and other levels of government) employing land-use data a refined approach to measuring land uses. LBCS currently recommends incorporating remotely sensed data in the “Site Development Character” dimension, but this only applies to certain aspects of visual characteristics and does not fully exploit the potential of remotely sensed data.	Land use is a complex concept that requires many types of “visual” and “non-visual” cues.  Planners currently rely on local real property tax information as a proxy for land use, but that is incomplete at best and misleading at worst.  Augmenting such local data with “ground truth” is an expensive process.  This is where remotely-sensed data can improve community growth DSSs.  With inexpensive GIS and computing platforms now ubiquitous in local governments, this is an opportune time to integrate geospatial tools and techniques into planning applications. Remotely-sensed data can also extend traditional planning analyses to encompass certain environmental issues that would otherwise be difficult to analyze. 2.0     Purpose In general, the evaluation and benchmarking phases of the systems engineering approach involve understanding the requirements for, and technical feasibility of, Earth science and remote sensing tools and methods for addressing DSS needs, as well as a quantification of the achieved improvements.  Technical requirements for inputs and outputs of the DSS are identified as well. Evaluation results will be used to populate or update the information contained within the Missions to Models DSS Inventory (Appendix A). The DSS missions are researched thoroughly to determine their operational requirements, funding profiles, relationships to the National Applications, and relevance of NASA capabilities 3.0	      Scope Tasks outlined by this SOW include all labor, material, equipment, and travel necessary to provide the tasks and deliverables identified below.  NASA anticipates awarding a firm, fixed-price contract. 4.0      Tasks The following tasks will be undertaken by APA in collaboration with NASA. Task 1  Evaluate LBCS’ data assimilation capacity for NASA Earth Observing System data (EOS) Identify an integrated methodology to classifying land use/land cover using remotely-sensed data, NASA shall provide information about the various Earth Observing Systems sources such as: MODIS, ASTER, Hyperion, ALI , SRTM, TRMM, GRACE, and other NASA science results. Evaluate the effectiveness of this approach as applied to several land use/landcover category types in conjunction with other LBCS dimensions (mainly the visual ones: site development character and structure types). Develop a set of categories that users employing this kind of remotely sensed data can easily apply to classification of land uses. Task 2    Validation of EOS data in LBCS After selection of the application and the geographic area, APA will work with one or two local planners in a selected geographic area to validate the classification scheme and the remote-sensing data stream.          APA will present three sample applications selected from the list below .These key application areas involve the environment, hazards and infrastructure management.   Surface analysis for flood and storm-water management Earth fissure analysis for establishing stable development areas. Landscape mapping for arid regions of the country for water conservation. Landscape analysis for air quality, heat island effects, forest and urban interface. Landslide analysis for hazard mitigation and emergency management Mapping extractive resources (aggregates mainly) essential for development. Mapping impervious surfaces with land use to better manage local effects of flooding        Task 3 Benchmarking the effectiveness of a data assimilation capacity The final component to the systems engineering approach involves benchmarking the enhancements to the EOS data on the partner-owned DSS. Benchmarking of a DSS is a process of measuring the performance of the DSS according to specified standards and reference points to document its value and to identify areas for improvements.  The measurements can include such tangibles as the time to produce results, the accuracy, quality, and reproducibility of DSS results, and the enhanced DSS’s ability to fill a previously unmet need of the DSS owner.	Since LBCS itself is a set of standards for local planning data, the benchmarking component will primarily focus on establishing the standard of reference. It will summarize the implementation of new LBCS categories to an existing LBCS dataset. 5.0	  Deliverables Deliverables for all Tasks shall be reports in MS/Word submitted on CDROM in digital form.  No travel is required for this work. 6.0       Performance Standard Task 1	   An evaluation report describing the process and rationale for the selection of EOS data sources and the updated set of categories for remotely sensed data on the LBCS.  This report shall also describe how remotely sensed data can be integrated into land-based data for planning applications (similar to the FAQ page currently on LBCS website).  The contents of this report will also be posted to the APA website at    http://www.planning.org/LBCS	. Task 2      A validation report describing the processes and quantifiable results of the EOS data assimilation in the planning applications areas.  The report shall also include relevant information on the planning end-user and their requirements for implementation. For example, if a state agency were to help in testing the categories, they would host the completed application on the state agency’s website so as to integrate with other data layers.  Task 3	      A benchmarking report that quantifies the impact of NASA EOS input(s) on the DSS output(s), comparing the DSS performance before and after the EOS data assimilation.  If a standard reference point does not exist, then benchmarking refers to measuring the performance to establish a standard of reference.	Assessing the performance of an original DSS without enhancements being implemented first creates the baseline benchmark, and then performance of the enhanced DSS is assessed and compared with the baseline. 7.0    Proposal Format The proposal shall provide a milestone payment schedule that is sufficient to recover all costs (i.e., labor, materials, travel, other direct costs, overhead, G&A, and incidentals) necessary to complete each task in the Statement of Work. This activity shall commence after successful contract negotiations and issuance of a firm-fixed price contract.  Notice to proceed shall be issued by the NASA SSC Procurement Office.   8.0    Schedule The performance period of this SOW is from the date of this order and continue through six (6) months.  Deliverables shall be provided to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the following schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a delivery schedule for the tasks and deliverables identified above. The Government intends to acquire commercial services using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on March 10, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Offutt AFB Nebraska is in the process of preparing an Invitation for Bid (IFB), solicitation number F25600-03-B-0003, for the repair of sanitary sewer service, “Area 2”, project SGBP 03-6005P2.  This project consists of the replacement, repair, rehabilitation, and/or placement of the sanitary sewer collection system located on the north side of Offutt Air Force Base and a lift station at Lake Offutt.  The area includes manholes 222F through 293.  Work on the sanitary sewer collection system involves the rehabilitation of sags, cracks, misaligned joints, protruding taps, and debris.  Some pipes will be increased in size to accommodate future flows and avoid future construction areas.  Deteriorating masonry manholes will be rehabilitated with spray applied mortar coatings or replaced with new precast concrete manholes.  Infiltration, roots and other structural defects will be eliminated with placement of an interior cured-in-place pipe.  The scope of work also includes the rehabilitation of selected service laterals.  The service laterals selected will be rehabilitated by removal and replacement of the existing pipe or installation of cured-in-place pipe.  Some select buildings will receive double cleanouts placed five feet outside of the building.  The estimated performance period is approximately 180 calendar days.     The NAICS Code is 237110 and the small business size standard is $28.5 million.  The magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  This action is considered for full and open competition.  The following milestones are tentative in nature and are for informational purposes only:  IFB release date on/about 29 July 2003; opening of bids on/about 29 August 2003; estimated completion date on/about 30 June 2004.

The date and time of the site visit will be included in the solicitation.   Interested parties are reminded to check this website regularly for amendments.   Drawings and specifications will be mailed to interested parties upon the interested parties’ request.   For drawings and specifications, contact laurie.techmeier@offutt.af.mil.      Telephoned or FAX bids will not be accepted.  All bids must be valid through 30 November 2003 or your bid may be considered non-responsive.  All potential bidders are reminded, in accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), that lack of registration in CCR will make a bidder ineligible for award.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering to support the development and delivery of a complete recording system that is safe, efficient, and reliable for chronic implant applications, as demonstrated and validated by both in vitro and long-term in vivo testing.  In past research and development, multiple microelectrode recording sites have been fabricated on shanks as small as 60 microns wide and 15 microns thick.  Amplifiers integrated into the silicon microelectrodes have successfully amplified and buffered signals from single and multiple unit extracellular neural activities.  Additional electronic circuitry that provides selection of multiple recording channels and multiplexing of signals from multiple recording sites has also been integrated into the array.  Acute recordings have demonstrated the functionality of this multiplexed system.  After three months implantation in guinea pig auditory cortex, excellent biocompatibility of these microeletrodes has been demonstrated with healthy appearing neurons within 10 microns of the microelectrode recording site.  A series of polymide cables have been fabricated allowing high-density two-dimensional interconnections to active recording probes in vivo.  In moving towards the long-term goal of developing an integrated microelectrode system that permits recording of extracellular neural activity from many neurons over decades of use in humans, this research and development project will build on previous results with an emphasis on chronic implant applications.  In addition to the microelectrode array, the implantable system consists of a cable system to provide a signal and power path between the microelectrode array and the external world, and a telemetry system for transmission of the signals from an implanted array to an extracorporal receiver.  The cable system will be designed to be compatible with human implantation and must not transmit mechanical force to the microelectrode array that would cause it to be displaced in the neural tissue.  An interface circuitry will be designed to provide on-chip amplification, filtering, time-division multiplexing, and in vivo real-time signal processing.  Although no human studies are required at this stage, the system should be tested rigorously both in vitro and in vivo, especially on chronic non-human primates with a goal of eventually developing a system capable of providing chronic neural recordings from human cortex.  The overall objective of this research and development project is to design and fabricate a chronic microelectrode array for recording of neural activity from many neurons over decades for use in humans.  The array will have an integrated cable and telemetry system that permits signals collected from these microelectrode arrays to be sent reliably out of the body.  Such an integrated system will include an electrical cable, in vivo signal processing circuitry and a telemetry unit.  The system will be tested in vitro and in chronic behaving primates.  The focus will be on the reliability of the system in recording quality signals over a period of 6-12 months, and on its safety and effectiveness in general design.  No human studies will be required.  Personnel with established expertise in micromachining, bioengineering, integrated circuit design, integrated circuit fabrication, and animal studies will be needed to perform this research.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of four (4) years in September 2004.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-04-04 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26. ****

<CONTACT>EDWARD M. HENNESSEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2032, E-Mail: hennessey.mike@epa.gov
<DESC>The Ecosystems Research Division (ERD) of the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) requires a research-grade 600 MHz wide-bore nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to conduct research in the metabolism and transformation of xenobiotics in biological systems and the environment.  The spectrometer shall be a product-line instrument and shall not be a prototype nor test model.  The NMR spectrometer will be used to measure rates of xenobiotic transformation and identify the resulting products (e.g., metabolites). The results from these studies will be used to develop a computer-based metabolic simulator.  The NMR spectrometer is intended to be an ORD-wide resource tool, primarily for the ORD Computational Toxicology Research Program, but will also be utilized in the areas of human health, ecosystem assessment, clean & safe water, safe food, and homeland security. Initial studies will be conducted using hepatic microsomes and S9, which  will be dosed with a variety of xenobiotics at various concentrations (e.g., 10  M).  The NMR spectrometer shall be both sensitive and versatile enough to provide continuous, accurate xenobiotic transformation rate data on a single sample over a 48 hr period while maintaining a constant  temperature of 37oC.  Due to the wide range of chemicals, rates of reactivities, concentrations, and expected conjugates, the NMR spectrometer shall be configured to enhance both sensitivity and throughput?especially for the identification of metabolites, some of which may be present at concentrations an order of magnitude less than the parent compound.  Towards that end, the NMR spectrometer shall be interfaced with a liquid chromatograph to separate the xenobiotic and its metabolites and the NMR spectrometer shall be constructed such that it can easily be interfaced with a mass spectrometer. The NMR spectrometer shall be designed to allow for easy sample recovery.  The spectrometer system shall be fully computer automated with complete spectral acquisition and analysis software. As part of the evaluation process, vendors will be requested to analyze a series of samples and will be expected to not only demonstrate the standard and cryogenic probes specified in the statement of work, but also provide clear and concise recommendations for probes which may be more appropriate, but were not specified. In addition to identifying xenobiotic metabolites, the NMR spectrometer will also be used for metabonomic studies to measure endogenous metabolites in biofluids, tissues, and other biological matrices.  The instrument should be configured to conduct metabonomic studies and analyze the resulting data. This requirement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12, "Acquisition of Commercial Items".  This is an unrestricted solicitation.  All requests for the solicitation must be submited via e-mail.  The solicitation will be available electronically only.

<DESC>Statement of Work 

Title:  Calculation and Mailing of Regulatory Fee Assessment Notification Postcards
Location: Office of Managing Director, Federal Communications Commission


Project Goal:

To improve the effectiveness of the FCC’s Regulatory Fee program and increase the program’s collection process by:

•	Assessing the appropriate regulatory fee that is due of all U.S.-licensed, commercial entities in the following fee categories: AM and FM Radio Stations, AM and FM Construction Permits, FM Translators/Boosters, VHF and UHF Television Stations, VHF and UHF Television Construction Permits, Satellite Television Stations, Satellite Television Construction Permits, Low Power Television (LPTV) Stations, and LPTV Translators/Boosters.

•	Mailing postcards, on a facility ID basis, to the entities listed above in order to provide notification of the assessed fee amounts that are due for each facility ID.   

•	Linking, to the extent possible, entities to their respective Federal Registration Number(s) (FRN) in order to ensure each entity’s fee sufficiency across multiple fee categories and for any given fiscal year.

•	Analyzing end-of-year regulatory fee payment data for fee sufficiency and sending collections letters to fee deficient entities in an expedient manner.


Project Summary:

Section 9(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, authorizes the Commission to collect annual regulatory fees to recover the annual costs of its enforcement, policy and rulemaking, user information, and international activities.  The Commission’s Schedule of Fees sets forth annual regulatory fees for specific categories of regulatees in the Media, Cable Television, Wireline, Wireless, and International Services. 

In carrying out the Commission’s annual regulatory fee notification and collection activities, we seek the assistance of a Contractor who can (1) compile a comprehensive spreadsheet of the above Media Services entities on a facility ID basis, including addresses, population counts and other data attributes necessary for calculating regulatory fees; (2) prepare and mail assessment notification postcards to all entities and/or their respective legal representatives; and (3) compile a fee payment report from which to generate collections letters by comparing end-of-year regulatory fee payment data to the comprehensive spreadsheet of Media Services entities.

The Commission will use its existing CORES database to establish all possible links between the entities and their respective FRNs.  The Contractor will then compare its independent database to the CORES data and data gleaned from the Media Bureau’s Consolidated Database System (CDBS) in order to assure that the addresses used for the postcard mailings are based on the best possible data.  The compilation of CORES data and the contractor’s data will then enable the Commission to ensure the above entities’ fee sufficiency across multiple fee categories for any given fiscal year, and to readily identify non-payments and other fee deficiency issues.


Scope of Work:

Deliverables for this project will include three major reports to the Commission and one batch of postcards.  Deliverables may also include such interim reports to the Commission and samples as are appropriate to the progress of the project.

The first report delivered will be a Management Summary Report that indicates revenue by fee code and classification of AM/FM/TV stations.  The second report will be a Detailed Report (a.k.a. a comprehensive spreadsheet) of records on a facility ID basis.  Each record, at a minimum, will have a field for facility ID, call sign, licensee’s FRN and/or additional FRNs associated with the facility ID, licensee name and address, calculated fee, payment type code, and sufficient information to determine the basis of the calculation.  The last report will be a Payment Report derived from CORES/RAMIS payment data.  It will indicate, on a facility ID basis, FY 2004 regulatory fee payments received for each facility ID, payment type codes and the FRN associated with the payment.  The reports will be provided to the Commission electronically in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

The postcards will be printed by the contractor or a subcontractor to the contractor.  The postcards will be mailed to Media Services entities.  The postcards will be mailed by the contractor.  

Depending upon the success and progress of this project with media services entities, the COTR may broaden the scope of this contract by activating options to create spreadsheet reports and to mail assessment notification postcards to additional regulatory fee service categories.  However, the COTR and the Contractor first must mutually agree to exercise any additional options.  No options to this contract can be activated in lieu of, at the expense of, or as a substitute to, the fundamental contract deliverables; i.e. spreadsheet reports and assessment notification postcards for media services entities.  See also Optional Deliverables section.





Deliverables:

The following deliverables are scheduled for 2004.  However, this is a five-year multi-year contract that can be extended in one-year increments as far as September 30, 2008 at the mutual consent of both parties.  If this contract is extended into Contract Years 2-5, the schedule of deliverables shall repeat itself each time of year for the subsequent Contract Year in question. 

No specific calendar date is attached to Deliverable 1 in Contract Year 1.  As such, the scheduled calendar date for Deliverable 1 in Contract Years 2-5 shall be deemed February 1 of each subsequent Contract Year.

Deliverable 1 – No later than three weeks after the award of contract, the contractor will provide the Commission’s Performance Evaluation and Records Management Office (PERM) staff with the following: (1) an evaluation of the quality of fit between CORES, CDBS and contractor data; (2) an initial Management Summary Report of revenue by fee code; and (3) an estimate of the number of postcards that will be generated for the mailings.  

The initial Management Summary Report will be provided either electronically or in hard-copy.  The Management Summary Report will be based on the regulatory fee structure of the prior year (FY 2003), and will indicate revenue by fee code and classification of AM/FM/TV stations.

Deliverable 2 – By May 1, 2004, the contractor will provide to PERM a final Management Summary Report, based on the FY 2003 regulatory fee structure.  This report will indicate revenue by fee code and classification of AM/FM/TV stations.  The contractor will provide the final Management Summary Report electronically in the format of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

Deliverable 3 – By May 10, 2004, the contractor will provide to PERM staff a draft design of the initial version of the assessment notification postcards, as well as a sample of the paper stock on which they will be printed.  PERM staff will approve or edit the draft design in one or more cycles of information exchange with the contractor until PERM gives its commitment for the final look and content of the postcards by June 1, 2004.  

Deliverable 4 – By June 8, 2004, the contractor will provide PERM staff with a web address that permits access to the contractor’s electronic database of AM/FM/TV entities on the basis of facility identification number.  From this web address, PERM staff will be able to search all non-proprietary records for each facility and will be able to rewrite information such as facility address, facility fee-exempt status and contact information.  Web access to the database will be provided to no fewer than four PERM employees.  The web access will be provided continuously until September 30, 2003 at 11:59 p.m.

By June 15, 2004, the contractor will make the web address available and functional for media services entities to review their facility information and make changes to information such as facility address, facility fee-exempt status and contact information.

Deliverable 5 – By June 15, 2004, the contractor will have the postcards printed and ready to mail.  The contractor will mail the postcards.  The exact date of the mailing will be determined by PERM, but will be no earlier than June 15, 2004.

Regardless of format, the postcards are to contain the following information:  Facility ID, Call Sign, Contact Address, Fee Type, Fee Amount, Market Ranking (TV) or Class of Station (AM/FM), Population Served (AM/FM), and FRN associated with the Facility ID.

Deliverable 6 – From June through September 2004, the contractor will address, without PERM’s assistance or participation, up to 100 fee or station classification inquiries from AM/FM radio stations and up to 50 fee or station classification inquiries from VHF/UHF television stations.  Regulatory fee amounts for media services are driven by station classification; therefore, we anticipate that a number of entities will question or seek clarification of the criteria that was used to classify their radio or television stations.

The Commission will pay the contractor $50.00 per inquiry to address inquiries from AM/FM stations that exceed 100 and to address inquiries from VHF/UHF stations that exceed 50.  Prior to paying the contractor to address inquiries that exceed either category, the contractor will first provide the Commission with a log that shows at a minimum the company name, contact person and telephone number for each inquiry, the time of call, and a brief description of the nature of the inquiry. 

Deliverable 7 – By October 10, 2004, the contractor will provide to PERM a Detailed Report of Media Services entities.  This detailed report is actually the comprehensive spreadsheet of media services licenses.  The contractor will generate it by integrating its own data with the Commission’s data.  The resulting deliverable will then be a comprehensive spreadsheet of the most accurate and current information available concerning media services licensees.

The Detailed Report will be a spreadsheet of records listed by facility ID.  At a minimum, each records shall contain the following data fields: call sign, licensee’s FRN and/or additional FRNs associated with the facility ID, licensee name and address, telephone number, calculated fee, FY 2004 payment type code, and sufficient information to determine the basis of the calculation, including market rankings for TV stations and populations served for AM/FM radio stations.  The contractor will provide the Detailed Report electronically in the format of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and will provide a master copy of the report on diskette, CD-ROM or other media format accepted by PERM staff.

Deliverable 8 – By October 15, 2004, the Contractor will provide an initial Payment Report.  The Payment Report will consist of FY 2004 regulatory fee payment data received from CORES/RAMIS, coupled with the facility ID records populated in the Detailed Report.  The Payment Report therefore will enable Commission staff to easily identify regulatory fee payments made for each facility ID, as well as non-payments, underpayments and any other payment discrepancies on a Facility ID basis.  

After the COTR reviews the initial Payment Report, the Contractor, at the COTR’s option, may further refine the Payment Report’s data in an attempt to increase the number or percentage of exact matches in the following data fields for each record:  facility ID, call sign, payment type code, and fee amount.  The amount of refinement needed to be applied to the initial Payment Report will be dependent upon the quality of the payment data; i.e., how completely and accurately fee payers submitted their FCC Form 159 fee payment data in CORES/RAMIS.

All data refinement exercises must be pre-approved by the COTR before the Contractor commences any work.  The COTR may also instruct the Contractor to cease all data refinement work if it is not yielding results satisfactory to the COTR.  The amount of data refinement will be limited to both the funds available and the due date for the final Payment Report.  In the event that funds for data refinement are not exhausted, refinement work will cease when the percentage of records with exact matches reaches 99%.  

After all data refinement exercises are completed or ceased, the initial Payment Report will be known as the final Payment Report.

Deliverable 9 – By October 31, 2004, the Contractor will provide the final Payment Report to PERM staff.


Optional Deliverables:

Upon the mutual agreement of the COTR and the Contractor, identical tasks and deliverables (spreadsheet development and postcard mailing) may be applied to the regulatory fee service categories of cable subscribers, cable antennae relay service station (CARS) licensees, and/or satellite earth station licensees.  Some aspects of cable subscriber and cable operator data are maintained by the Media Bureau.  These data are also made publicly available by various commercial research companies.  CARS data are maintained in the Media Bureau’s Cable Operations and Licensing System (COALS) database; earth station data are maintained in the International Bureau’s International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) database.  

Any options that are activated must progress on a schedule of deliverables that is in line with the schedule of deliverables for media services entities.  Specifically, optional deliverable dates shall lag no more than two weeks behind the deliverable dates established for media services entities.


Required Fee Calculation Methodology:

For commercial VHF/UHF television stations, the Contractor will base the regulatory fee amount upon the size of each station’s Nielson Designated Market Area (DMA) as listed in the 2004 Edition of the Television & Cable Factbook, Stations Volume No. 72, Warren Publishing, Inc. 

For commercial AM/FM radio stations, the Contractor will base the regulatory fee amount upon station classification and population served by the station within its city grade coverage area.  The Contractor’s source of population data will be U.S. Census data for 2000.  To calculate fees for AM/FM radio stations, the Contractor will first apply data values contained in CDBS to predict each station’s distance to the city grade contour for each of 72 radials.  The resulting distance to city grade contours will then be used to form a geographical polygon.  Population counts for each station are then to be calculated by determining which 2000 block centroids are contained in the station’s polygon.  The sum of the population figures for all enclosed block centroids represents the total population for the predicted city grade coverage area.


Contractor Qualifications:

To qualify for consideration for this contract, the selected Contractor must maintain its own database or otherwise automated system of records for media services entities that is independent of the Media Bureau’s Consolidated Database System (CDBS).  

Absent exigent circumstances, the Contractor shall be available upon three business days notice from Commission or PERM staff to attend meetings with Commission or PERM staff and/or any outside experts or contractors retained by the Commission, in order to present, discuss and/or analyze the contractor’s work products and the Commission’s needs. 


Special Contractor Requirements:

A.  Data rights:  

The products created as part of this contract are Excel-based spreadsheets.  The spreadsheets will contain attributes such as licensee names, addresses, call signs, FRN's, market area size (for television stations) and population served (for radio stations) for media services licensees.  The spreadsheets will be used to direct the mailing of assessment notification postcards and to determine the fee payment status of facility IDs at the close of the FY 2004 regulatory fee season.  

In performing this contract, the Contractor will not develop software for the FCC.  Rather, the Contractor will compile spreadsheets of records in support of the Commission’s regulatory fee assessment initiative.  All records’ attributes in the spreadsheets will consist of publicly available information except for one attribute – the radio station population served attribute.  The Commission assumes that the population served attribute will be calculated through software developed at the Contractor’s private expense and that the resulting population served data embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.  As such, the population served data will be treated as limited rights data and the provisions of the FAR “Rights in Data” clause are hereby incorporated by reference.  See 48 C.F.R. § 52.227-14, Alt. I.  

In furtherance of the FCC’s regulatory fee assessment process, the contractor agrees to allow access to the population served data attribute on an individual query basis.  As such, all attributes of a single record may be queried by the public one record at a time by entering the unique data of either a facility ID or a call sign into a web-based search engine provided by the Commission.  The Contractor does not authorize any other public access or use of population served data except as specifically provided above.

In accordance with agency regulations, the Contractor shall be notified of any requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for access to the population served data beyond the limited use provided for above, and will be given the opportunity to oppose the release of this information. See 47 C.F.R. § 0.461. Under these rules, the Commission will not release the commercial and proprietary data for which Contractor has requested confidentiality prior to its notification and in accordance with the protections afforded by the FOIA regulations.  

To facilitate the Contractor’s request for limited use/confidential treatment of the population served data, at the time of delivery the Contractor should note and describe which portion of the spreadsheet(s) is encompassed by the provisions of this clause.


Deliverable Format:

Regarding the preliminary evaluation of the quality of fit between CORES, CDBS and contractor data, PERM will accept the evaluation in verbal or written form.  Regarding the postcards, PERM will accept the initial design for the postcards based upon Commission standards for mailings.  The Contractor will provide all reports, including the final Detailed Report (a.k.a. the comprehensive spreadsheet) and Payment Report electronically in the format of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  The Contractor will also provide a master copy of the Detailed Report and Payment Report on diskette, CD-ROM or other media format accepted by PERM staff.


Period of Performance:

This Task Order shall be effective from date of its execution until September 30, 2004.  However, as a five-year multi-year contract, its effectiveness may be extended in one-year increments as far as September 30, 2008 at the mutual consent of both parties.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>On or about 22 March 2004, the Government plans to release a final RFP for the Compact Pulsed Power Supply (PPS) Project of the Electromagnetic (EM) Gun  Technology Maturation and Demonstration Army Science and Technology Objective  (STO) Program.  The primary objective of this program is to reduce the  technical risk associated with designing, fabricating and operating pulsed  power supplies in an electromagnetic gun weapon system.  The Government intends  to award a contract to develop a PPS preliminary design, identify critical  components and processes, conduct critical component hardware demonstrations,  generate a detailed PPS design based on lessons learned from these  demonstrations, stimulate performance of the detailed PPS design via a physics  based model, and build a high fidelity breadboard PPS.  The RFP will include a  performance specification for the power supply consistent with an EM gun system  that can deliver 2MJ of muzzle energy per shot to defeat a wide array of  militarily interesting targets and can be integrated into a lightweight mobile  platform.  Period of performance will be 36 months.  During the industry one on  ones held during August 2003, the Government indicated that consideration would  be given to leaving the solicitation on the street for 45 days.  At this time  this not a consideration and a 30 day response time is anticipated.

<DESC>This solicitation is a 100% Small Business Set Aside, five-year IDIQ for the Outlet Valve Disk (OVD), NSN: 4820-01-502-7372, P/N: 5-1-3525.  The anticipated maximum five-year quantity is 1,000,000.  This is best value procurement, and past performanc e will be evaluated along with price and technical.  FOB is Destination.  A First Article Test (FAT) is required 90 days after contract award.  The government may consider waiving FAT for those contractors that have previously produced this item.  If FAT i s required, deliveries will commence 60 days after FAT have been approved.  The Outlet Valve Disk is a critical part on the M40A1 and M42A2 Protective Gas Masks.  The outlet valve disk is attached to the outlet valve body on the mask and permits a one-way flow of air going out of the mask.  The outlet valve disk allows a mask userÃ¢Â€Â™s exhaled air to be discharged from the mask and prevents outside air from entering the mask through the same opening.  Since the outlet valve disk is used on a sealing surfa ce of the mask, it is crucial that the disk be free of defects such as wraps, bumps, nicks, excess material, etc.  To assure proper performance the outlet valve disk is required to pass leakage testing as well as meet a maximum airflow resistance when air is exhaled.  The outlet valve disk is molded from an olive drab silicone rubber and has an approximate diameter of 1.2 inches.  The material thickness of the outlet valve disk is approximately .022 inches.  Extending out from the center of the disk is a st em measuring slightly over one inch in length.  Near the base of the stem is a knob that helps secure the outlet valve disk to the outlet valve body of the mask. Estimated issue date is March 11, 2004.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in ac cordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(2)(7) and 14.205-1(c) therefore hardcopies will not be provided.

<SUBJECT>A--Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP)
<SOLNBR>W74V8H-04-R-0025
<RESPDATE>030504
<ARCHDATE>05042004
<CONTACT>Robert Lavelle, 703-614-4578
<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was previously published as a Special Notice (USA-SNOTE-040213-003) on 13 February 2004.  This pre-solicitation notice incorporates the BAA Identification Number and extends the date for submission of proposals to  05 March 2004.  Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number W74V8H-04-R-0025.  THIS IS A PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND A CALL FOR PROPOSALS.  The Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP) was established to provide opportunities for the increased introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DACP Program is managed through OSD(AT&L), DUSD (AS&C), Comparative Testing Office.  DACP provides any person or activity within or out side the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements.  Opportunities proposed, known as Challenge Proposals, at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for res ulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program  DACP Summary and Final Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition  Challenge Program.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technology or product that demonstrates a near-term potential to improve existing acquisitions for any DoD activity. DACP prefers technologies and products that have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-term transition at the completion of evaluation.  However, proposals that exceed a 24 month test and evaluation time line are permitted.  DACP technology areas include, but are not limit ed to: manufacturing processes; medical; power generation and storage; weapons and munitions; sensors; electronic warfare; garments and protective gear; command, control, communications and computers (C4); intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR ); chemical, biological, and nuclear detection/protection; space systems and related equipment; aircraft and related equipment; ground vehicles and related equipment; unmanned vehicles (UAV, UUV); materials; logistics equipment and related processes; secur ity; training and simulation; propulsion; ship and boats; submarines; paints and coatings; human systems and related equipment; and other.  Technology areas listed are not in priority order nor all inclusive.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, or Summary Phase, persons, organizations, and government activities interested in participating will submit a document called a Defense Acquisition Challenge Program Summary Proposal.  A DACP Summary Proposal is a brief s ummary of the proposed project.  The Summary Proposal compares and contrasts the current technology, or lack there of, with the proposed technology, its application and benefits.  It will include: 1) a description of the technology, product, or process to be evaluated, 2) a summary of its capabilities and the potential benefit(s) to the program of inserting the technology/product/process, 3) identification of the DoD Acquisition Category (ACAT) designation of the program that the capabilities will be aligne d and/or incorporated against, 4) a cost estimate, including methodology, for the test article acquisition or proposed technology or process improvement, and 5) current maturity state of proposed project, including estimated test phases for evaluation appr oach.  A Summary Proposal and Quad Chart are required during the summary phase.  The Summary Proposal and Quad Chart templates can be retrieved on the DACP Bids website at https://www.bids.acqcenter.com/dacp.  Although not required, a letter of interest fr om the DoD Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the ACAT program may be submitted in conjunction with the Summary Proposal.  Al l Summary Proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review.  Evaluation criteria for project selection at the Summary Proposal Phase are: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at an acceptable cost, and wi thout unacceptable disruption to the acquisition program.  Summary proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing Department of D efense acquisition programs.  An acquisition program of record (POR) that has been identified as potentially benefiting from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct an independent review of the Summary Proposal.  The DoD Program Manager , in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program, will decide whether to sponsor, or accept, the proposal.  In the SECOND PHASE, or Final Phase, PORs that have accepted the Summary Proposal will be extended an invitation to develop and su bmit a Final Proposal to compete for DACP funding to evaluate the proposed technology.  The purpose of the Final Proposal is for the sponsoring government program office to identify the issue, the means by which the technology or product will resolve or im prove the issue, DACP funding required to evaluate the technology or product, the length of the evaluation will take, and the program officeÃ¢Â€Â™s plan to transition the technology or product if it meets the programs requirements.  Final Proposals may req uest funding for test article acquisition, test and evaluation of the test article, appropriate vendor cost, integration costs, and some government program office costs.  DACP funds cannot be used to implement the technology or product if successful.  Pers ons, organizations, and government activities submitting DACP Summary Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above and are accepted by the acquisition program will be extended an invitation to work with the DoD sponsor to submit a Final Proposal.   The DACP Final Proposal will include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) o f the technology or product into the acquisition program; test article cost; and a cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application.  The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (sa fety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program.  During the second phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all Final Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b.  The Government review of the Final Proposals at the second and final phase will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likeliho od of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal.  Proposals will be selected for funding based on the Final Proposal asse ssment and the availability of Government funding.  Approximately $12 million is available for all FY2005 projects based on the PresidentÃ¢Â€Â™s Budget.  Thus, funding for participation is highly competitive, and cost to evaluate the proposed technology or  product should be considered.  The final number of projects and respective funds allocated will be determined once all final proposals have been received and e valuated and congress appropriates the funding for FY05.  Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s).  Final FY05 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2004.  All submissions i nto the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED.  Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail.  If a submittal contains classified information, the offeror must first obtain a DOCUMENT IDENTIFIER number through  BIDS for tracking purposes and identify in the comments section why the submittal cannot be uploaded and submitted via the automated system.  The BIDS tracking number must be clearly marked on the mailed submittal.  Classified responses must be appropriat ely marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures.  All classified documents must be packaged and shipped in accordance with regulations and instructions pertaining to the level of classification.  Classified proposals must ad here to the same Summary Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website.  For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil.  Mailing instructions will provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and must be recei ved by the applicable due date and time.  Classification does not in any way eliminate the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA.  Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Summary Proposal submitter. In general, deb riefings of the summary proposals are not anticipated.  It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DACP or limited funding availability.  This should not b e construed as a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of t his Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Persons submitting proposals are advised that only the Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds.  While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization.  Proposals must be received/submitted via the DACP website NLT 2400 hours EST , 5 March 2004.  Summary Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle.  All Summary Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the FY05 templates provided on the website.  Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  Questions regarding DACP should be direc ted to defensechallenge@osd.mil or 703-788-9361.

<CONTACT>James R. Watts 202-781-3958
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. is soliciting new and innovative concepts that are integrated and aligned with our ASW Concept of Operations and which offer the potential to fundamentally change the way Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) is conducted by the U.S. Navy.  The Navy is interested in technologies that will dramatically improve curren t and future operational ASW capabilities.  The Operational Vision for future ASW missions is discussed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Within this Roadmap, ASW mission areas fall under the Littoral Sea Control component of the Sea Shield Operational Concept as enabled by FORCEnet, an envisioned architecture of sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons and supporting systems integrated into a single comprehensive maritime network. ASW is considered essential to assuring access and asserting maritime superiority in forward operating areas. Information on the order of battle and specific mission areas in which ASW capabilities will be required was provided at a Pre-solicitation Conference on 23 January 2004 in Washington D.C.  A SECRET CD-ROM containing the releasable information presented at the Pre-solicitation Conference is available upon request to those organizations  that provide the necessary security information to enable PEO IWS to verify facility clearances.  Requests may be sent to A.Sabella@stanleyassociates.com.  The Navy primary objective in this solicitation is to acquire readily transferable technologies that will reduce the Observe, Orient, Decide, Attack (OODA) Loop and reduce risk to manned platforms and forces due to Threat Submarine operations.  The Navy ASW Investment Strategy for the near and mid-term is based on improving capabilities in the following areas; Battle-space Preparations, Target Detection, Target Engagement and Platform Self-Protection.  The Navy is most interested in new and innovative (breakthrough) concepts that can be rapidly employed in  U.S. Navy ASW Concept Of Operations (CONOPS).  Of secondary interest are concepts that require extensive exploration or those standalone technologies that provide enhanc ement to our existing ASW capabilities.  The scope of this BAA will include three Phases; your proposal should address each Phase. The scope of Phase 1 should be to develop the proposed concept in a manner that allows Navy Subject Matter Experts to cooperatively evaluate its feasibility.  The scope of Phase 2 should be to conduct a shore-based feasibility demonstration to convince Navy Subject Matter Experts that the proposed concept can work.   The scope of Phase 3 should be to conduct a “Limited Objectives” at-sea experiment of the proposed concept.  This BAA will be open through 30 September 2004.  Proposals may be submitted any time within that period.  Contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and "other transactions," as appropriate, will be limited by funding availability. .  Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged.  The Navy desires to begin  making awards by May 2004.  Contractors may submit study proposals.  Studies, if proposed, should identify innovative solutions, technologies, cost drivers, and development approaches suitable for demonstration within 12 months from award.  Study proposals must be limited to no more than 10 pages.

This is an Indefinite Quantity (IQC) Solicitation under Commercial Test Program  
Procedures.
NOTE: Extended to March 11, 2004; 4pm Local Philadelphia Time
This solicitation is being amended to incorporate the latest revision for DOD Barcoding. 
1.  The latest revision of the DOD Bar Code Marking, Rev P dated December 15, 2002 is required for this procurement.  Therefore, the following shall apply:

For all shipments of packages material to the government, which includes either depot DLA-direct or DVD (customer-direct) shipments, both DOD linear and 2-D bar code markings are required on military shipping labels in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December 15, 2002.  2-D bar coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MHLO.8.3) and DOD 4500.9-R.  MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 16388.  MSL label stock quality shall meet MIL-PRF-61002. MSL bar code print quality shall meet ANSI MHLO.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000) for applicable 2-D and/or linear bar codes.  All DVD shipments shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD 52.211-9008.  When the contract/order omits any data element required to be bar-coded, the field shall be zero-filled.  These requirements do not apply to delivery orders when the basic contract has not been modified to require MIL-STD-129P.  If there are inconsistencies between the schedule and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.

2.	The following Clause is hereby added to the Addendum to FAR 52.212-4:
DLAD 52.211-9010	Military Shipping Label (MSL) Requirements- MIL-STD-129P  (Feb 2004)
 
  (a)  MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December 15, 2002, establishes the requirement for Contractors that ship packaged materiel to the Government to provide both linear and two-dimensional (2-D) bar coding on military shipping labels (MSLs) (but see exceptions in paragraph (d)).  The new requirements apply to all shipments, which includes either depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-Direct) shipments.  Linear (Code 3 of 9 or Code 39) bar codes continue to be required on interior packages (unit and intermediate packages) for the National Stock Number (NSN) and, when applicable, the serial number; and on shipping containers and palletized unit loads for the NSN, Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, contract number and, when applicable, the serial number.  The new requirements do not apply to delivery orders when the basic contract has not been modified to require MIL-STD-129P.
 
  (b)  The new MSL replaces former DD Form 1387 and is illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b of MIL-STD-129P.  The MSL requires Code 3 of 9 or Code 39 linear bar codes for the Transportation Control Number (TCN), piece number and DoDAAC for the ultimate consignee or mark-for address.  The 2-D bar code on the MSL must contain the document (requisition) number, NSN, Routing Identifier Code (RIC), Unit of Issue, Quantity, Condition Code, and Unit Price, which are ordinarily included on the DD Form 250 or the DD Form 1348-1A.  MIL-STD-129P provides numerous illustrations of what must be bar-coded and the recommended placement of the bar code.  When the contract omits any data element required to be bar-coded, the field should be zero-filled.
 
  (c)  MIL-STD-129P, sources for conforming labels, and related information are available on the DLA Packaging Web Site at URL: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/offices/packaging/specstdslist.html#STDs. 

This procurement is for 23 Core Items and 86 items may be added on a post award basis

<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Science and Technology Division, Countermine Team, proposes to award a sole source contract to Nomadics, Inc. for follow-on effort to continue the refinement, fabrication, demonstration, testing, and maintanence of an Amplified Fluorescence Quenching Polymer-based (AFP) explosives detection sensor, named FIDO.  The current FIDO system de signed by Nomadics is a low volume sensor that, for its intended application, requires non-automated sample introduction.  This effort seeks to improve the existing system by automating sample collection, integrating the senor on robot platforms, and impro ving general sensor performance.  This integration effort can significantly improve the performance of the FIDO sensor.  The contract will be negotiated as a follow-on effort and shall be awarded under the authority of other than full and open competition,  FAR 6.302-1, on a cost plus fixed fee basis. The duration of this effort is 36 months.  Any further request for information shall be via e-mail to the following e-mail address:  wanda.fair@cacw.army.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This is a request for information / sources sought announcement to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  The Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment is considering a purchase of an Low Noise Signal Generator.  This item is a low noise signal generator with a frequency range from 0.1 to 3000 MHz.  This synthesized signal generator will be used by the Air Force Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL) and the Air Force's Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) and is replacing the HP/Agilent 8662A/63A signal generators used in the E5504B Phase/AM Noise Measurement Systems.  While having AM/FM/PM modulation capability, output power of at least 13 dBm, a timebase stability of 5 x 10-10/day, it will also have exceptional spectral purity, especially where it comes to phase noise.  As an example, SSB phase noise at 1 GHz is expected to be on the order of:  -79 (10 Hz), -103 (100 Hz), -127 (1 kHz), -134 (10 kHz), - 140 (100 kHz), - 155 (1 MHz), in dBc/Hz (offset from carrier). The estimated quantity is 152 units. Offerors responding to this sources sought market research must (1) state whether they are a small or large business.  (2) indicate if they are a small disadvantaged or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small business; (3) advise if you have the item on a GSA schedule  (4) provide information concerning the technical capabilities of the product you are interested in offering, including commercial literature/brochures. (5) advise if you accept the Government purchase card; (6) any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess your firm’s capabilities; (7) Provide Point of contact and assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. At this time, no solicitation exists. Submit all responses to this notice to the point of contact listed below.

N61331-04-T-MM01 Diver Hull Navigation System with Component Integration of Navigation, Sensor, Communication and Display Subsystems GOVERNMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Diver Hull Navigation System with Component Integration of Navigation, Sensor, Communication and Display Subsystems. THIS IS NOT A  REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NSWC Panama City on behalf of the Program Executive Office Littoral and Mine Warfare (PEO-LMW) Program Management Office Explosive Ordnance Disposal (PMS-EOD) is seeking information on diver based hull search or navigation systems and component technologies for use when conducting Explosive Ordnance Disposal diving operations, including searching and inspections of ships hulls and berthing areas.  This notice serves as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting research efforts.  NSWC PC and PMS-EOD are interested in systems and technologies that will support diver navigation and search capabilities.  Ultimately, this will support this mission by providing capabilities in the following areas: 1)	Record of where the diver has searched, ensuring there are no ‘holidays’ in the earch area.  2)	Means of recording a mark for the location of an  item of interest 3)	Interoperability with a ship hull database 4)	Diver display of marks to enable reacquisition 5)	Record of the ship frame number corresponding to a marked location. 6)	Ability to record multiple types of marks 7)	Identification of ship features. 8)	Real-time communication (topside-to-diver, diver-to-topside, diver-to-diver) of navigation or location information and imaging data. 9)	Man portable in a small boat operating environment 10)	Navigation and detection systems integrated with a diver display 11)	Detection and navigation in low visibility environments 12)	Detection capability of objects of interest.  Ideally display resolution would enable detection of objects as small as 2 inch x 2 inch x 1 inch at distances up to 50 ft. 13)	Swimmability such that (a) in water components allow diver to conduct mission unencumbered by the system, (b) use of  the system does not cause diver fatigue (c) system maximizes the ability to free the divers hands to perform other mission tasks. 14)	Power source replaceable or rechargeable at the operational level. 15)	Efficient navigation and search capabilities such that mission time is minimized. 16)	Navigation and sensor data update rates sufficient for effective conduct of diver tasks and topside monitoring and response. 17)	Data storage of all mission generated navigation and sensor data.  The system must be lightweight and man portable.  Any component of the system that is not diver borne shall have a small shipboard footprint and able to provide top-side operations from a small inflatable craft.  Open system architecture to allow for future upgrades is a desirable feature.   This RFI addresses three major areas: 1)	Navigation, sensor, and communication systems that can be  integrated with a standard display to support user operational evaluations for the development of the diver hull mission concept and requirements. 2)	Displays suitable to the mission operational environment, which could receive input from navigation and sensor systems and present information to the divers. 3)	Systems integration concepts to support both near and far term diver hull mission capabilities. (i.e. Information Exchange protocols between Diver Search and Navigation Systems, Remotely Operated Vehicles and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles Navigation Systems.) Interested parties must provide paper submittals, to be received by the Government by 1630 hours on 24 November.  The Government will assess submittals for their potential use in the diver hull navigation mission.  Contractors’ submittals that the Government determines to possess potential for contributing to the  diver hull search and navigation mission solution may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system or subsystem.  Contractors must identify for which of the three areas listed above their submission is to be considered.  The assessment criteria are based on system technical maturity, potential effectiveness, performance, suitability, cost, and schedule. The Navy is contemplating convening a limited-scope demonstration event in the May through July time frame and anticipates inviting selected Contractors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  For the purposes of the demonstration, the focus will be on verifying system ability to satisfy the assessment criteria while operating in a relevant operational environment.  The government does not anticipate providing funds to Contractors to participate in the demonstrations. There is no specific format or outline tha t submittals must follow.  However, information pertinent to the assessment criteria, especially system or subsystem technical maturity, should be provided.  Include other descriptive literature and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Contractors responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), 8(a), or large business (L).  Please include four (4) copies of each response.  Each response must reference the RFI title and must be limited in length to ten (10) typed pages.  Specific narrative information that should be provided in the submission include: (1)	System description, capabilities (2)	Chronology of system development (3)	Summary of past test events with location, dates and results (4)	If available, logistic supportability and  projected unit cost estimate information.  (5)	In anticipation of Contractor invitation for the limited scope demonstration, provide an explanation of what would be demonstrated and any additional support required of the government necessary for the Contractors participation in the demonstration. Supporting literature and test documentation that demonstrate technical maturity of your proposed solution may be included in addition to the 10-page narrative paper.  Contractors offered an opportunity to demonstrate their system will be provided additional details including demonstration schedule and extent of support the Government will provide.

<DESC>This project will inventory intertidal sand and mud infaunal invertebrates in Southwest Alaska Network (SWAN) parks, and provide recommendations for long term monitoring. The minimum needs are: a) Characterize the composition and distribution of intertidal invertebrate assemblages inhabiting intertidal sand and mud flats in the SWAN parks, primarily focusing on dominant bivalves in these assemblages; b) Characterize abiotic factors known to influence species composition, distribution, and relative abundance in infaunal assemblages in these important soft sediment habitats, including inorganic (grain size and sorting) and organic (Total Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen) properties; c) Identify candidate target species for long-term monitoring based on: distribution, abundance, sensitivity to habitat change, ecological importance, and ease of sampling; and d) Recommend biological parameters to measure for target species; physical parameters to measure for habitats. The minimum requirements are: a) Principal investigators must have at least twenty years field work experience working with soft sediment invertebrates in the northern Gulf of Alaska - specifically Cook Inlet and Shelikof Strait. This is essential because contractor must have taxonomic familiarity with local benthic infauna and habitats, and knowledge of how to sample in vast remote intertidal flats that are unique to this area of the North Pacific; b) Principal investigators must have experience in evaluating effects of the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) on soft sediment habitats and invertebrates in the northern Gulf of Alaska (outside of Prince William Sound). This is essential because SWAN parks were impacted by EVOS and have ongoing oil persistence monitoring that needs to be evaluated as part of the contract; c) Specialized experience in surveying benthic infauna by trawl, diving, benthic grab, dredge and box core, underwater television, and still photography. This is essential for conducting a comprehensive inventory of Park coastal habitats; and d) Experience working within the parks, and with the staffs of Lake Clark, Katmai, Aniakchak, and Kenai Fjords National Parks on marine resource protection issues. This is essential because the contractor must recommend monitoring strategies to protect park resources.

<DESC>The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense through the Executive Agency of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates the competitive award of a two-year pilot requirements contract to provide a centrally-managed source of Workers' Compen sation Insurance as required by the statutorily mandated Defense Base Act (DBA).  A DBA insurance contract pilot program is expected to provide a means to assess whether it might be advantageous for the Department of Defense (reduction in rates, improvemen ts in contractor participation in overseas procurements, establishing effective competition, and all other factors considered) to award a contract to one insurance company to provide DBA coverage for all of USACE contractor employees working overseas, simi lar to the contracts awarded for this purpose by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of State.  Under this pilot program for all Corps of Engineers contracts and subcontracts involving any overseas performance, the contractor's  requirement by law to provide overseas employees with insurance coverage pursuant to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act/ Defense Base Act or DBA, would be centrally managed by a single insurance company during the contract duration, u nless a waiver has been obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor.  The successful contractor shall deal directly with the companies requiring DBA insurance for payment arrangements and resolution of issues.  No Government funds will be allocated under an y agreement or contract governing the administration of the Centrally-managed Pilot Program.  Reimbursement for DBA insurance will be under the appropriate contract.  Interested Insurance Companies must also provide the following information:  a brief conc ept of operations statement for such a centralized program; advantages and disadvantages over status-quo; and a brief description of potential for teaming and potential to reduce adverse impacts to the existing insurance industrial base, which includes all  groups under the Small Business Act.  Responses should be sent to Susan Burchell, either via email at susan.m.burchell@usace.army.mil or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity, Contracting Office, ATTN:  Susan Bur chell, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA  22315.  Responses must be received no later than 1400 hrs, EST on 15 March 2004.  A Washington, DC based Industry Forum is also planned for 29 March 2004.

<DESC>DESC:  Market Research - This synopsis represents market Research and the Government's attempt to expand the vendor base of an item currently restricted to a limited number of sources. The following information is provided to industry:  The Hydraulic Pump, NSN 4320-01-455-7253, PN 12965300, SIC 3561, is a source controlled vendor item and a substitute item shall not be used without prior approval.  Consequently, a qualification requireme nt is necessary for potential offerors to become qualified and to be demonstrated before contract in order for adequate data to be available to assure that the part, if procured from that potential source, will perform the same function in the howitzer as the one to be replaced and that the source is capable of producing the part.  It is estimated that the combined fabrication and testing duration for pump qualification in this case would require about 9 months at a minimum, with an estimated cost of $75K.  In addition to meeting all the requirements specified on hydraulic power pack assembly drawing 12965300, the following must be performed:  Proof pressure test; operational test; immersion, basic shock, vibration, endurance, voltage operating range, temper ature - high and low.  Interested contractors can contact TACOM-RI for a more specific description of qualification testing requirements.   This item is only produced by vendors qualified by the Government.  This synopsis does not constitute a commitment b y the Government to place a contract with anyone who submits an item for qualification testing, nor does it constitute a commitment by the Government to place a contract with anyone who qualifies their item.  Passing the qualification procedures only guara ntees that your company name will be added to the list of qualified producers on the drawings.  Any requirements for the hydraulic pump  will be competed among the qualified vendors listed on the drawings.  This synopsis does not constitute authorization t o begin work or incur costs against this announcement.  In accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3, the Government does not intend to award a contrat on the basis of this announcement.

6.  Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted, or modified:

ADD: SPECIAL REQUIREMENT.  


ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall result in a corresponding increase in the time afforded to Charterer to accept delivery of the Vessel.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  See paragraph IV(ae) for additional requirements, although the requirements of COMSC instruction 5530.3 shall apply only to time charters of six months or longer.   

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: IMMUNIZATIONS. (U.S.-flag only)

(1)  U.S. flag time chartered vessel services are considered essential contractor services to the Department of Defense in support of military and associated support missions.  As a result, Masters, officers, crewmembers, and other individuals who are embarked on such vessels for Owner’s purposes, including but not limited to subcontractors, are considered contractor personnel performing mission essential services under DODI 3020.37, November 6, 1990, (Change 1, January 26, 1996), and are subject to the following:

    a.  Masters, officers, crewmembers and other individuals, as described above, who are embarked on any vessel subject to this charter must be medically pre-screened and immunized in accordance with Commander, Military Sealift Command (COMSC) policy, and any changes thereto, in effect or made during the period of this charter, including any options or extensions.  Owner shall ensure that all Masters, Officers, crewmembers, and other individuals embarked on any vessel subject to this charter comply with all such immunization programs.  Notification of immunization requirements pursuant to this section shall be provided to Owner by the Contracting Officer.

    b.  When immunizations are required pursuant to this clause, Owner must provide notification, as directed by the Contracting Officer, of the immunization status of all embarked personnel within 24 hours of fixture or award.  Further, at any time during the contract period, the immunization status of any relief personnel scheduled to board the vessel is required no later than 96 hours prior to the personnel change, unless authorized otherwise by the Contracting Officer.

    c.  Any Master, officer, crewmember or other individual who refuses to comply with the immunization requirements, or who is ineligible for a particular required immunization as provided herein, shall be removed by Owner from the vessel as soon as possible, but not later than the next port call unless authorized by the Contracting Officer, and replaced with personnel who either have the required immunization or are eligible and will comply with the policy.  Any removal and replacement of personnel pursuant to this clause shall be solely at Owner’s expense, including, but not limited to, travel, per diem, wages and associated administrative expenses.

    d.  Crew shortages resulting from the application of this section may subject the vessel to being placed off-hire.

Contractor shall provide (Owner’s account) a certified marine chemist to certify tanks safe for entry for internal tank inspection by government/charter representative.  If a prior (last and next to last) cargo contained a percentage of benzene, Owner’s certified marine chemist must also measure toxicity for benzene content and certify safe for entry.  If partial shipment is offered, adjacent tanks next to Government cargo are to be gas-free.  Last and next to last cargoes carried in tanks must be an approved product.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTE: When submitting an invoice, please additionally send an email to tankers@msc.navy.mil, john.joerger@navy.mil, and janet.noel@navy.mil referencing the AWB/tracking number, invoice number, vessel name, amount of invoice, and a brief description of the nature of the invoice.

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall be considered as time excluded under clause III(m)(3).


ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: DEMURRAGE DOCUMENTATION.  In the event of demurrage, all supporting documents as identified in TANKVOY III(d) (3) Invoices, shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage invoices. After receiving the Contracting Officer's concurrence, Owner may submit demurrage invoices (with the DD Form 250-1) to the office identified in Box 18b of SF 1449.

MODIFY: II – Incorporate revised clause 52.212-4 (Oct 2003).  Tailored language still applies. 

MODIFY: III(p) – add new sentence at the end of subparagraph (1): “The United States of America shall be named as an additional Assured Party with waiver of subrogation on all applicable insurance policies.”
