<DESC>MULTICELL AND DISMOUNT COMMAND AND CONTROL, SOL BAA 03-33, DUE:  08/14/03; POC: MR. GARY SAUER, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (571) 218-4550. Background:  This BAA is structured to specifically support the mission of the execution of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Future Combat System Command and Control (FCS C2) Program. The FCS C2 program is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) led effort, with the cooperation of the U.S. Army Communications–Electronics Command (CECOM) Research and Development Center (RDEC). The focus of this effort is to expand upon the research effort of the Future Combat Systems Command and Control (FCS C2) Program to determine the next level of requirements, C2 functions and information profiles/flows for FCS Unit Higher Headquarters, Multiple FCS Unit’s Command and Control, Dismounted Soldier and Dismounted Commander Operations.  The research to date has built a prototype C2 system which integrates previously stove-piped Battle Command operating systems/functions into a single tailorable display for decision-making.  The supporting Command and Control Experimental Demonstration System developed in the FCS C2 Program will be extended to support this expanded research in determining the technical challenges in Battle Command for Multiple FCS Unit interactions, Higher Headquarters’ Command and Control, and Dismounted soldiers as a subsystem to the FCS Family of Systems design. The current command and control system experimental demonstrator (prototype) for the FCS Unit already illustrates the potential for a significantly reduced staff to control and employ its organic assets within the unit. In addition to minimizing supporting staff, an important part in expanding this research effort will be to assess whether the system under test is scaleable to other FCS echelons and joint task force elements to facilitate future C2 with multiple Battle Command functions integrated into a single Battle Command System to empower the decision-maker with information to understand current and future states while reducing uncertainty. The FCS C2 program had several distinct components:  The Integrated C2 Systems and Operational Architecture, the development of a simulation federation to stimulate the C2 prototype, a supporting Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) lab and the development of the C2 prototype.  The program began with a Start-up initiative (Phase I), followed by an FCS C2 Architecture Study initiative (Phase II) and the FCS C2 development and Experimentation initiatives (Phase III).  Phase IV of the FCS C2 program is the subject of this request and includes continued FCS C2 development/maturation and Experimentation in support of Multicell and Dismounted C2 capabilities. FCS C2 Start-up phase (Phase I). The start-up phase (October 2000 - January 2001) consisted of the preparation of program plans, personnel recruitment, and contracts. FCS C2 Study (Phase II). The FCS C2 Study was a two-phased effort, the first of which was a 10-month effort to initially investigate and document the following: An operational and systems architecture for the C2 Prototype, developed in accordance with version 3.1 of the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) “Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Framework 2.0” (December 1997). This framework is a standard adopted by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) community for developing systems architectures. The FCS C2 Study or Technical Team published their initial report, Future Combat System (FCS) Unit Cell C2 Architecture Study, Interim Report in January 2002. This report was leveraged to execute the experimentation effort in phase 3. The second phase, which concluded in April of FY03, involved refining and updating the results of the first phase. FCS C2 Program Organization. To build the C2 Prototype, DARPA and the CECOM RDEC formed three teams: a Technical Team, an Operational Team, and an Experimentation Team. The Technical Team consisted of personnel from academia, the Army, and industry. This team was primarily focused on the FCS C2 Study effort described above, to include making subsequent refinements and updates to maintain its accuracy and applicability to program goals.  The Operational Team was mentored by senior level active duty and/or retired military personnel and consisted of several School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) graduates with positional experience throughout the U.S. Army's Forces Command (FORSCOM) and the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This team was primarily focused on developing the Unit Cell’s operational information flows, its experimental force structure, and the Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (DTTP) used in each experiment. The Experimentation Team included a team of human performance scientists from the Army Research Institute (ARI) and was primarily focused on developing the C2 Prototype, the FCS C2 Simulation Federation, and the overall plan to test the project’s hypothesis.  This program organization, to include the general roles/responsibilities discussed above, will be maintained throughout the duration of the support Multicell/Dismounted C2 effort. The C2 Prototype (Phase III).Vision: Provide information to the operator such that the user is informed but not overburdened. CSE consisted of:–Operator Workstations, Collaboration Server (CS), Collective Intelligence Module (CIM), and Platform Support Environment (PSE). (1)  Planning and execution are integrated through the workstations and the collaboration server. This allows all workstations to simultaneously see and manipulate plans and execution information. The design includes provisions for a CDR decision aid using a knowledge base. (2) The CIM the PSE endow the Unit with it's network centric behavior. (a) The CIM is aware of the CDR’s intent.  The execution of the current tactical situation will be enabled through the use of an expert knowledge based system. (b) The PSE defines platform TTP’s using an expert knowledge based system (e.g., evasive maneuver). FCS C2 Experimentation (Phase III). The experimentation effort consisted of developing and testing the prototype C2 software in a series of experiments to validate the C2 system design Key to this effort is a crawl, walk, run approach, while reviewing the enabling technologies and systems (i.e. C2 Prototype, One Semi-Automated Forces TestBed (OTB), Sensor Effects model). Through its first four experiments, the FCS-C2 program has developed an initial infrastructure to represent critical integrated functionalities of the FCS unit maneuver, lethal and suppressive effects and intel/sensors.  Future experiments anticipate addition of detailed dismounted simulation, network-centric communication effects, RF jamming and other non-lethal effects, logistics/sustainment and expansion of the force structure beyond that of the FCS unit.  Existing simulation infrastructure, including a heavily-modified version of OTB, a Sensor Effects Model (SEM) and other supporting components are expected to require enhancements and supplements to provide the necessary synthetic environment for continued evaluation of the prototype software and affiliated battle concepts. SCOPE - RESEARCH TOPIC INTEREST: This part of the BAA contains statements of the Research Interests required by DARPA/ IXO. Prior to proposal submission, questions on technical matters and availability of project funding relating to a particular Research Interest should be directed to the DARPA Program Manager via email to BAA03-33@darpa.mil.  When responding/inquiring on a specific area of research, refer to the Topic Number listed below. Multicell and Dismounted C2 Background. The Multicell and Dismounted C2 research program (effort covered by the requirements of this BAA) will build on the earlier success and approach of the FCS C2 experimentation effort and expand the decision space to the operation of multiple FCS equipped units with higher headquarters, dismounted soldiers and joint force connectivity. The program’s objective is to determine how further integration of Battle Command functions of multiple FCS units, dismounts and higher headquarters ( joint) may be achieved to support a network centric force. The program will build an expanded decision space to support these eschelons and functions with full collaboration. The program will consist of four major elements: 1) Architecture development and documentation 2) Testbed development and expansion, 3) Expansion of the decision space and Human Computer Interface to address the aforementioned levels of command and 4) Conduct a series of experiments as illustrated in the milestone chart (see PIP) to measure and assess the effectiveness of the mission software modules supporting the expanded decision space. The FCS-C2 Program is a fully interrelated program consisting of several interrelated Technical Topic Areas.  All offerors selected to provide Contractor Technical or other support under this BAA, as directed by the government, will be required to work as part of a “Combined Technical Team”.  As such, offerors should be prepared to work in close coordination with the collective personnel supporting the other Topic Areas of this BAA. The current Research Topic Interest Areas. (1)  Battle Command and Control For Future Combat Systems (C2 Prototype):  This topic seeks to encourage the developmental work in the area of mission software development that integrates formally stove-piped Battle Command functions into a single integrated display for decision making of an FCS equipped force.  This program will be examining multiple unit, higher headquarters and dismounted information needs for decision making thru integrated and innovative Battle Command solutions. (2)  C4ISR Modeling & Simulation For C2 Concept Assessment:  This topic seeks to encourage developmental work in the area of C4ISR modeling and simulation support to integrated Command and Control protoype for the FCS unit’s family of systems design. A realistic C4ISR simulation provides a synthetic environment in which concepts and prototype software can be evaluated through appropriate stimulation and response.  Simulation provides a means to realistically represent current “real-world” capabilities in all areas of the C4ISR spectrum, as well as those that do not yet exist.
(3)  FCS C2 Architecture Development: Under the scope of this topic area, the offerors required performance will be broad, encompassing a wide range of research activities, to include the coordination, conduct and documentation of an architecture study to develop an operational and systems FCS C2 Architecture at the dismounted soldier level of command through the higher headquarters and joint levels of command supporting the Objective Force. (4)  FCS C2 Experiment Planning, Execution, and Analysis:  This topic area seeks the developmental work in the area of Experiment Planning, Design, Execution, Data Collection and Analysis. Innovative approaches to support experimentation in Battle Command in an emulated network centric environment are highly encouraged. (5)  Infrastructure Support for Development, Simulation, and Experimentation  Environments:  This topic seeks to encourage developmental work in the area of hardware/software integration, production of modeling and simulation support systems, prototyping, and systems engineering support to enable peek performance and reliability of Developmental, Simulation, and Experimentation Environments. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.      Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  Offerors may submit one or more proposals against any of the five (5) topic areas identified above.  It is the Government’s intent that no more than one proposal be selected for any given topic area, and that Topic Area 1 and Topic Areas 2 through 5 be awarded to separate offerors.  Offerors are permitted to propose on any number/combination of Topic Areas 2 through 5 (i.e., one topic or multiple topics through a teaming approach). Funding:  The resulting contract(s)/agreement(s) will be incrementally funded by fiscal year, assuming identified milestones have been satisfactorily met. Funding in the out year(s) is subject to the availability of funds. Period of Performance:  The general contractual period of performance is anticipated to comprise approximately eighteen (18) months duration, however contracts may be executed for a lesser period of time.  The specific duration will be dependent on the performance goals of the Topic Area, but will not exceed twenty-four (24) months without options or thirty-six (36) months with options. GENERAL INFORMATION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) has an electronic upload process for proposal submissions for BAA 03-33.  The BAA tool is intended to facilitate an electronic process beginning with the proposal uploads through the review and evaluation of submitted documents.  Instructions for use of the DARPA/IXO BAA Tool are available for download at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/multicell/index.htm.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.

Based upon this investigation, Chelton was contracted to develop an antenna that satisfied the requirement.

Required delivery is approximately 8 months after date of contract award. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407.

<DESC>NASA/SSC has a continung requirement for provide a broad range of propulsion test operations and support services to enable NASA, resident agencies and commercial tenants to meet their roles, missions and requirements.  NASA/SSC intends to purchase the services from the incumbent contractor, Lockheed Martin Space Operations, Inc. through a series of one-month options covering the period from March 2004 through September 2004.  Current contract NAS13-650 will be modified to include these options.  Initially, only options for the months of March, April, and May 2004 will be exercised.   The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as stated in FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Award to any other source would result in (1) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and (2) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements (FAR 6.302-1 [a] [2] [iii]). This requirement is being competed through RFP 13SSC-O-02-38, which closed in March 2003.  At the time, it was expected that award under the RFP would be completed and the new contract in place by February 2004.  However, the Source Selection decision was protested and the GAO sustained the protest.  Accordingly, source re-evaluation has not yet concluded.  The addition of these seven one-month options are to cover the period of time expected for re-evaluation to conclude.  The incumbent contractor is not involved in the protest.  Thus, this requirement is for a transitional period only.  It is expected that any existing subcontracts would be extended accordingly.	It is not expected that the inumbent contractor will award new subcontracts during this transitional period.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URL link below.  http://www1.eps.gov/Numbered_Notes.html

<ARCHDATE>03182004
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Joshua Bowers, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2104
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541720   The U.S. EPA, Sustainable Environments Branch, Sustainable Technology Division at the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Professor Harland Wm. Whitmore, Jr., of the Economics Department at the University of Cincinnati, to support the Sustainable Systems to develop theories and mathematical models of the macro-economic component of complex ecological, economic, and social systems. Professor  Whitmore was awarded EPA purchase order 2C-R129-NASA on a competitive basis to develop a  fundamental mathematical theory of sustainable systems. Now, EPA has identified additional theories to be developed based on the results of the previous order.   For the current requirement, the contractor shall: (1) construct and deliver a mathematical price-setting macro-economic model for a  simple trading system for incorporation into an expanded ecological food web model being developed at the U.S. EPA, and (2) construct and deliver a mathematical price-setting macro-economic model for incorporation into a food-web model for a real ecosystem drawn from the literature.  The expanded  food web model includes a human population, and three trophic levels including plants, herbivores, and carnivores, industrial agriculture, and an industrial process. Developing the macro-economic model shall include organizing the top omnivore population into trading groups, creating basic market  rules, and other associated tasks.  The macro-economic model shall be suitable for incorporation into the existing food web model.   The macro-economic model shall also be suitable for running computer simulations of the combined ecological and macro-economic model.  The mathematical model shall  consist of the appropriate differential equations and associated algebraic equations.  This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates Professor Whitmore is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project.  Since these tasks are a natural progression from the work completed under the previous order, it would take considerable time for a new contractor to become familiar with the work already completed. Additionally, the macro-economic models are highly complex and complicated mathematical constructs  and any other contractor would require extensive and costly training to have the ability to deliver the services under this purchase order.       However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such  work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before February 18, 2004 at 5:00 PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13,  Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541720.  Interested parties should submit their technical documentation, referencing RFQ-OH-04-00051, to Mr. Josh Bowers, as follows: via regular mail: U.S. EPA, Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, or via Express Mail/Hand Carry:  U.S. EPA,  4411 Montgomery Road, Suite 300, Norwood, OH 45212. Faxed quotations are acceptable and may be  sent to (513)487-2109. Quotations may sent electronically via e-mail to bowers.joshua@epa.gov.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure an upgrade of its Government owned Affymetrix GA2500 workstation to a GSC3000 workstation from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  The Center for Cancer Research is the largest Intramural Research Program within the NCI and at the NIH.  Its mission is to provide a major impact on human health through scientific discovery and translation of basic research to cancer prevention and treatment.  The CCR has as one of its missions the goal of providing tools for NCI researchers to enable comprehensive gene expression analysis of cancer, provide training protocols and technical support to NCI researchers and to develop new microarray technologies and applications.  The upgraded scanners provide advanced features of automation, sample tracking, ability to scan smaller features in the arrays (11 microns vs the old 18 microns), much smaller footprint for space saving, and higher throughput of scans.  The new scanner is absolutely required to analyze the most recent advances in Affymetrix Gene Chip technologies.  This equipment will be used in conjunction with existing Government owned Affymetrix equipment that is already in the lab.  Therefore, it is essential that this equipment be procured from Affymetrix in order to maintain the comparability of the data from ongoing experiments.  This equipment is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Affymetrix, Inc is the only organization known to the NCI researcher that has aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on February 10, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to award on a sole source basis, a contract to ASRS C/O Liberty Systems,Inc., Bethesda, MD. 20814.  The contract is for installation of compact shelving at the new National Audio Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) in Culpeper, VA. The shelving being provided by ASRS exactly matches a significant amount of existing shelving which belongs to the Library, and has already been installed in a temporary fashion in an Elkwood Va. warehouse. These existing Elkwood shelving units will be relocated to the NAVCC site in Culpeper and incorporated with new matching materials into one inventory for installation at the NAVCC site.   

In order to maintain consistency with regard to repair, maintenance, future expansion, and overall inventory, the new materials are being purchased to match the existing materials, which is (EleCompack). In addition, the existing shelving units can only be salvaged and reused if they are incorporated into a like inventory, and installed by technicians who are trained and qualified to install those specific materials.        

The main support structure of the EleCompack system incorporates significant structural integrity via the use of features such as the recessed mounted carriage. The Library’s collection requires a complex, sturdy shelving system capable of storing priceless audio/visual media collections, the majority of which are extremely heavy, yet fragile. The EleCompack shelving units were selected under a competitive process for the Elkwood installations because of those technical qualities, in addition to having the lowest price.  We are allowing a posting time of (15) days.  A copy of the full solicitation will be posted on this site on 18 February 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

In order to be qualified, each design must undergo  an extensive battery of tests as specified in the Government Performance  Specification for the M858. Any Contractor interested in qualifying their  design shall be fully responsible for all coordination and costs associated  with the qualification test. Upon request, any interested contractor will be  supplied with the procedures necessary to qualify a new design. The procurement will be a full and open competition, and any responses received will be  evaluated for Best Value utilizing the trade-off method for selection,  resulting in single or multiple contractor awards.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Command (formerly U.S. Army Space Command) intends to solicit, negotiate and award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts for the provision of Scientif ic, Engineering and Technical Assistance for the Space and Missile Defense Initiatives Support II (SMDIS II) program.  This procurement is a follow-on to the current IDIQ, CPFF/CPAF multiple award contracts for the Space and Missile Defense Initiatives Sup port (SMDIS) contracts, which expire September 30, 2004.  SMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that two awards will be made as a result of 100% set-aside for small business.  (Note that this is a change to our acquisition strategy from that outlined in our initial Sou rces Sought synopsis of November 5, 2003.)  The resultant contracts will have the capacity to provide support to all Government agencies involved in the Space, Homeland Defense, and Missile Defense arenas and shall support all functional areas of the contr act Statement of Work (SOW), which include, but are not limited to: vision statements and doctrine; development of architectures; and, the provision of program support (e.g., planning, development, fielding documentation, modeling and simulation, system an alysis and integration, integrated logistics support, development of strategy, support to the warfighter, contingency and mission support, program oversight, independent verification validation and test evaluation, prototype development, sustainment and op eration, and analysis of emerging technologies).  This support shall primarily be focused in the five core SMDC/ARSTRAT mission areas, which are:  Space, Missile Defense, Information Operations, Global Strike and C4ISR.  Potential areas of growth include:  Infrastructure, Organization Analysis, and Evaluations; Intelligence Requirements; Systems Engineering and Systems Integration Analysis; Simulation and Modeling Development; Rapid Prototyping and Limited Development; Software Development, Network Developm ent, and Information Systems Support; Integrated Logistics Support; Emerging Technologies Analysis; Quick Response Support; Meetings and Conference Organization Support; Staff Support; and Blue Force Tracking.  The draft SOW, draft solicitation and applica ble attachments and exhibits, as well as historical SMDIS documents and other related information is posted to the SMDC/ARSTRAT website at www.armyspace.army.mil.  Industry comments related to the draft SOW were accepted until December 31, 2003.  Additiona lly, an initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on November 19 and 20, 2003, in order to ensure the utilization of best commercial practices, maximization of competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies throughout the acquisition process.  Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft SOW were not posted nor released; however, all applicable changes to the Government acquisition strategy resulting from the one-on-one sessions and draft SOW comments were inc orporated into the draft solicitation, which was posted to the SMDC/ARSTRAT website on February 2, 2004.  A second round of one-on-one sessions will be held with interested SMDIS II prime contractors on February 11 and 12, 2004, in order to discuss any que stions or issues concerning the draft solicitation.  Again, questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions will not be posted, but any applicable changes to the solicitation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the final RFP to be released on March 1, 2004.  The final RFP will also be posted to the SMDC/ARSTRAT website at www.armyspace.army.mil and all interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information as the SMDC/ARSTRAT website will  be the official means for SMDIS II acquisition information dissemination.  The solicitation NAICS Code is 541710 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  The resultant contracts will establish a five-year ordering period from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2009; however, individual task order period of performance will be determined by the type of appropriations available for funding the order and will be predominantly issued on a 12-month basis.  The anticipated total contract maximum will be $245 million for each award.  Questions may be addressed to the following:  Mary Gorman, Contracting Officer, 719-554-1960, mary.gorman@arspace.army .mil; Janet Schwarzbart, Contract Specialist, 719-554-1960, janet.schwarzbart@arspace.army.mil; or Gordon Baxendale, Program Manager, 719-554-2187, gordon.baxendale@arspace.army.mil.  Once the formal solicitation is issued, all communications shall be dire cted to the Contracting Officer, Mary Gorman, or the Contract Specialist, Janet Schwarzbart.

The purpose of this amendment is to 1) revise the instructions regarding proposal configuration/award restrictions and 2) revise the evaluation criteria identified in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Therefore, the following changes apply: 1) The instructions found in the initial BAA announcement and PIP regarding proposal configuration/award restrictions are hereby changed FROM "Offerors may submit one or more proposals against any of the five (5) topic areas identified above.

Offerors are permitted to propose on any number/combination of Topic Areas 2 through 5 (i.e., one topic or multiple topics through a teaming approach)." TO "Offerors may submit one or more proposals against any of the five (5) topic areas identified above.  The Government will not award Topic Area 1 and Topic Area 2 work to the same Offeror in any configuration.  The Government will consider award of any other single or multiple award configurations deemed acceptable to meeting the technical requirements of a Topic Area.  Multiple awards to a single Topic Area will be considered where functionally manageable by government integrators."  2) The PIP, Paragraph entitled "Evaluation and Funding Processes", is hereby changed to reflect corrections to the stated evaluation criteria FROM " (1) Quality and Technical Merit: Understanding of scope of the problem(s) and identification of technical issues; Soundness and completeness of the system design; Potential for highly reliable video understanding solutions; Justification of design choices as compared to alternative techniques; Degree of innovation - potential for revolutionary advance. (2) Relevance of Proposed Approach to the Program Goals: Level of realism and the clear definition of the problem domain; Suitability and clarity of the proposed capabilities for operational purposes; Quality and clarity of the Statement of Work (SOW) and Program Plan; Quality of the Evaluation Plan	.

(4) Approach to Technology Transfer: Understanding of video system architectures in laboratory and operational environments; Potential for low-cost integration into operational environments; Commitment to delivering results to others. (5) Cost Realism and Value of Proposed Work to Government: The total cost relative to benefit; The realism of cost levels for facilities and staff (including students); The cost-effective use of existing equipment and software; competitive costs on procurements; The cost-effectiveness of technology transfer. TO

<DESC>Draft RFP for Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Block 2, N00024-03-R-5114, was issued on 27 February 2003 to interested firms for review and comment.  NAVSEA has received and reviewed those comments.  Concurrently, the Navy has studied potential synergies with other programs, including joint service efforts.  As a result, the CEC Acquisition Strategy is being revised and NAVSEA will not solicit proposals for CEC Block 2.  The Navy expects to announce future competition opportunities based upon the new Acquisition Strategy.*****

"	Proposed Issue Date:  February 18, 2004 "	Title of Project:  Erosion Control Outer Island Description:  The work of this contract consists of This project at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore will involve the construction of a stone revetment along the shoreline of Outer Island to stop erosion of the shoreline.  The stone revetment will be approximately 500 feet long and 10 feet in height.  The site is off the Bayfield  Peninsula, in Northern Wisconsin;  approximately  50 miles off shore  from  the Washburn, WI docks.  All construction materials will need to be transported to the site by barge.  A second portion of the work involves a design build for slope stabilization above the revetment wall.  The slopes range from about 30 feet to 40 feet in height above the proposed revetment. Contractors interested in this project must show capability and experience in the construction of similar projects on the Great Lakes. Experience on the Great Lakes is required due to the project remoteness and the unpredictability and potential dangers of working on Lake Superior. "	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. "	Estimated price range:  $1,000,000.00 to $3,000,000.00. "	Time for completion:  one construction season as defined on Lake Superior.  "	Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available. "	All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.

<DESC>The pre-solicitation notice for NRCS-01-ID-04 was first published in FEDBIZOPPS on January 24th, 2004 and amended on January 27th to reflect the use of forms SF-254 and 255 instead of SF-330.
 
The purpose of this 2nd amendment is to correct the date for receipt of SF-254 and 255 forms from interested parties - February 26, 2004, and to provide additional information about the project to be designed.    An excerpt from the Draft Environmental Impact Statement is hereby made available to all interested parties for downloading at this site. 

The following information is in response to questions received from interested parties:

1- The A&E Evaluation Board will be comprised of NRCS personnel.
2- At this time no site tour is planned.  After the initial evaluation and selection of the top three firms, a site tour may be needed.
3- This A&E contract will not include construction inspection.   
4- At this time there are no funds for construction.
5- The NAICS code referred to in the original solicitation sets the size standard for small business.  For NAICS code 541330, for a business to be considered “small” the average annual gross receipts for the past three years cannot exceed $4,000,000.00.  
6-  The NRCS practice standards are available through the National NRCS web site:  http://www.nrcs.usda.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has an interest in obtaining information on products that may prolong the useful life of vehicle batteries in order to reduce the costs associated with their replacement and the environmental impacts from disposal.  The Service's mission is to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats.  The Service has staff located at over 600 individual locations throughout the U.S. including wildlife refuges, fish hatcheries, ecological services, migratory bird and law enforcement offices.  With a few exceptions, most locations have on-site staff ranging from approximately 5-30 individuals often in very remote locations.  The Service's entire fleet is approximately 6,000 vehicles and the above sites usually contain a variety of motor vehicles ranging from sedans, pick-up trucks, heavy duty trucks (transport, dump trucks,) and other heavy duty equipment including backhoes, bulldozers, etc.  Due to the location climate and program needs, some vehicles are seasonal and may have extended periods of idle time.  Some are garaged or kept under cover, other may be exposed to the elements for long periods of time and the weather conditions the equipment are exposed to vary considerably.  Some locations have on-site staff that can perform some maintenance while others rely on service performed by local garages and service stations. While not representative of all sites, the following is a sample listing of vehicles from one site: 1 GMC and 1 Sterling 6x4 transport trucks; 1 GMC 4x2 passenger van; 1 Sterling 6x4 dump truck; 8 8cyl 4x4 SUV/pick-up; 2 6cyl 4x4; 1 8cyl diesel; 2 backhoes and one bulldozer.  The Service is interested in identifying products that would be cost effective and efficient and in developing an implementation strategy taking into consideration its geographic and organizational dispersion and fleet composition. Companies who offer products can provide the following information/literature: (1) company information with contact name, phone, e-mail and web site; (2) basic concepts of the technology used (e.g. pulse technology, etc.); (3) description of the process, time, effort and skills needed to install and maintain the products; (4) past experience and references, especially in settings and with vehicles similar to discussed above; (5) costs of the units and any associated products, potential discounts, and warranty information.  Information submission and questions may be directed to Pete Langer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Contracting and Facilities Management, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 212, Arlington, VA 22203 peter_langer@fws.gov or 703-358-1901 http://www.fws.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  

Items being considered are ReFresh Air Freshener: Long lasting air freshener eliminates tough odors and leaves our room smelling fresh and inviting.  "ReFresh" can also be used on draperies, carpeting and furniture without staining.  24-month maximum shelf life (extendable).  NSN 6840-01-359-9207 (Country Garden Potpourri); 6840-01-359-9208 (Cinnamon); and 6840-01-359-9209 (Springtime Floral).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE MEDICAL X-RAY OPTICS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE MEDICAL X-RAY OPTICS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to find a commercial company who is willing to fund research, license the technology, and commercialize medical x-ray optics.

LLNL has developed a new technology which uses x-ray optics in biomedical research and nuclear medicine.  This technology provides a means of achieving high spatial resolution radionuclide imaging.  The high resolution results from the use of grazing incidence optics to image radiopharmaceuticals administered to a subject.  The use of these x-ray optics essentially magnifies the image to provide improved images.  This novel technology can provide high-resolution imaging at least down to100 micrometers.  LLNL currently has a prototype device and preliminary data.

The existing state of the art technique uses absorptive collimation to image x-rays from a sample.  This technology has an inherent inverse relationship between spatial resolution and sensitivity, which sets a practical limit on the achievable resolution.  Imaging systems employing x-ray optics, on the other hand, do not suffer from these limitations and could conceivably achieve resolution down to 10 micrometers.

This invention is particularly useful for studies involving experimental animals.  Current medical research uses radionuclide imaging to assess biological functions in experimental animals in a non-invasive manner.  This is particularly useful for the study of small animals during clinical studies for the purposes of understanding growth, development, or disease.  For example, the use of such techniques can permit each animal to serve as its own control in studies with a longitudinal design.  In general, animal models in research involve a large investment in time and expertise and researchers can use improved tools such as this technology to obtain a better return on their investment by gathering better data. 

LLNL would like to find a company who is willing to fund a cooperative research project to continue the development of this promising technology, and who is willing to license the technology for commercialization.

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's medical x-ray optics should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 65-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's medical x-ray optics.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO PRODUCE AND SELL HEATSINKS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS USING MICROCHANNEL COOLING
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO PRODUCE AND SELL HEATSINKS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS USING MICROCHANNEL COOLING


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to produce heatsinks for integrated circuits (especially microprocessors) using microchannel cooling.

LLNL has proven microchannel technology for providing aggressive cooling for semiconductor devices.  LLNL currently uses microchannel cooling to produce high performance water-cooled laser diode packages.  However, LLNL believes this same technology would prove effective in providing air-cooling for integrated circuits, such as microprocessors.

LLNL has an issued patent (#5,099,311 et.al.) which broadly covers the use of microchannel cooling as a means of cooling.   LLNL initially developed this technology to cool integrated circuits for “Star Wars” projects in the 90s.    Before developing this technology, LLNL analyzed the various methods of cooling and determined that microchannel cooling provided the best possible cooling versus other possible methods of cooling (A doctoral thesis on this subject is available).

The proven microchannel technology at LLNL uses heatsinks made of silicon.   Etching processes long perfected by the semiconductor industry permits fabrication of precision microchannels in the silicon heatsinks which lie in close proximity to the integrated circuit being cooled.  The resulting architecture minimizes most elements of the thermal resistance of the system to provide extremely effective cooling in a compact design.  

LLNL believes this technology is now timely for commercialization because of the current problems in cooling integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's microchannel cooling for integrated circuits should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 66-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's microchannel cooling for integrated circuits.

<SUBJECT>--San Juan Water District Notice of Intent to Negotiate one source
<DESC>Sources Sought/Notice of Intent to Negotiate with One Source.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc., the current onboard designer for the San Juan Water District Sponsor to perform design efforts associated with the Hydraulic Improvements to the existing San Juan Water Districts SJWD The District water treatment plant WTP associated with the Regional Water Conservation and Recycling Project in Granit e Bay, CA.   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, unless, as a result of an anal ysis of acceptable responses to this notice, a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation.  The Sacramento District Corps of Engineers, The Corps, is seeking to identify sources that are uniquely qualified to design the WTP s hydraulic improvements. The WTP was designed and constructed in the early 1970s by Clendenen and Associates Engineers.   As a result of the excellent performance of the water treatment plant WTP using the Clendenen process, it will continue to be used by the District into the for eseeable future.  The Clendenen design was never developed commercially, therefore the SJWD WTP represents a one of a kind facility. Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. completed the Districts Wholesale Water Master Plan during years 2000 and 2001. This comprehensive document has been the guide for subsequent WTP planning efforts, including the Hydraulic Improvements. The master plan was also the basis for the design and construction of several improvements to the WTP to increase reliability and treatment capacity.  Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. performed this subsequent planning and Design work. They have invested ma ny hours in learning and understanding the Clendenen design, including conducting field reconnaissance and WTP investigations to validate desktop evaluations, and developing system models and performance analyses on behalf of the District.   The developmen t of the Wholesale Water Master Plan, and the design and improvements to the WTP provides Kennedy/Jenks Consultants with the unique knowledge and qualifications to provide engineering and design services for the proposed Hydraulic Improvements.  During the Wholesale Water Master Planning effort, Kennedy/Jenks utilized a specialized hydraulic model along with extensive field investigations and surveys of the Districts WTP, to identify several areas where hydraulic and process improvements were need ed to optimize use of the WTP. Several of their recommended improvements have been implemented.  These improvements and Kennedy/Jenks model should be updated with the current WTP configuration and calibrated with actual field measurements to allow proper p lanning of the proposed extensive Hydraulic Improvements.  Kennedy/Jenks unique model cannot be duplicated in a timely, economic fashion, and again, makes Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. uniquely qualified to perform the work.  In addition to the technical  qualifications, Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc. has developed a professional rapport with the State of California Department of Health Services (DHS) and have demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of the DistrictÃ¢Â€Â™s unique WTP process, foster ing DHS confidence in the design, filter configuration and performance of the Districts WTP.   Kennedy/Jenks continued team building and interaction with DHS is critical for obtaining DHS buy-in and amending the Districts DHS water supply permit to ensure success of the proposed project. The most distinctive feature of the Districts WTP is the design of the filter system. The filter media profile, consisting of graded gravels, silica sand, and carefully specified anthracite, is similar to the typical design of a convention al WTP. However, the filter basin design, underdrain design, and filter backwashing system utilizing dual-drive, up-flow modular filter backwashing units with hydraulic surface wash injectors is the only one of its kind in the world.  Any work at the plant must be designed to allow the facilities to stay in operation during construction, and not affect the quality or quantity of treated water and the ability of the WTP to meet EPA and DHS requirements.  Kennedy/Jenks has developed a det ailed understanding of WTP operations through their exhaustive planning efforts as well as by working closely with treatment plant operators and staff over the past four years. They have earned the operators trust and they have effectively become partners with them during implementation of several design and construction projects; working closely with them to develop construction plans that allow them to meet their responsibilities to the public and regulatory agencies.  WTP operators have communicated to t he District management and the Board on several occasions and expressed their desire to see Kennedy/Jenks continue on with the work at the WTP. This is another qualification that sets Kennedy/Jenks apart for consideration of the design work.  Kennedy/Jenks Consultants involvement in planning, testing, design development, regulatory approval, and construction coordination of improvements to the Districts water treatment plant makes them uniquely qualified, and in the Districts opinion, the best choice, to continue the design of the next phase of the water treatment plant modifications; the Hydraulic Improvements. There are no Government-owned drawings or technical literature for the services described herein.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.   The following are the 5 criteria that we will use for evaluati on of qualification:  1.  Interested parties must be a licensed engineering, design and science firm and must be experienced in the fields.  2.  Information furnished should include detail of appropriate technical and professional qualifications.  3.  Info rmation furnished must demonstrate the interested party is able to perform engineering and design efforts associated with the hydraulic improvements, and the ability to replicate the plant specific hydraulic model at no cost to the government and client in  an expedited fashion.  4.  Information furnished must demonstrate firms experience with the planning, design, construction and operation of water treatment plants and specifically the Clendenen process.  5.  The interested party must pass a background sec urity check.   Information furnished as a minimum should include appropriate technical information and professional qualifications that demonstrates the firms ability to meet the minimum requirements listed above.  Responses should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages, total.  Oral or facsimile responses will not be accepted.   Responses should be sent to:  Barbara Marshall, Attn:  CESKPK-CT, 1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA  95814-2922.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Howeve r, all information received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault Aviation, previously Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  Each aircraft is equipped with two Honeywell ATF3-6 fan jet engines.  Typical failure modes of ATF3-6 engine nose-cowlings are material cracks that propagate as a result of various environmental factors.  Some of these include: vibration, corrosion, thermal fatigue and erosion.  These failures occur primarily at the nose lip rivet lines.  Past history shows that a complete or partial disassembly of the nose-cowling is necessary for thorough inspection and repair or replacement of damaged components.
