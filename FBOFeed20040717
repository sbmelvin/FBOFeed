<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the University of Washington, Seattle, WA .

Purpose:

The purposes are 1) to support the development and refinement of a screening tool appropriate to the identification of persons with possible co-occurring substance abuse and mental disorders, and 2) to use the instrument to help validate the Co-Occurring Quadrant Model, a conceptual approach to categorizing persons with co-occurring disorders developed with SAMHSA support by the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD) and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD).

 Provision of services for persons with co-occurring substance abuse and mental disorders is a major SAMHSA priority.  SAMHSA/CSAT has a unique opportunity to contribute to the treatment field by supporting the development of a reliable, valid, brief clinical screening tool for use by providers of service to persons with co-occurring substance abuse and mental disorders.  SAMHSA’s 2002 Report to Congress on Co-occurring Disorders identified screening as an essential component “no-wrong-door” services for persons with co-occurring disorders.  SAMHSA is currently developing a standard set of measures of provider performance in serving this population that will include a report on screening practices.  As yet, there is no standard, routinely used screening instrument available to the field.

The National Dialogue on Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders, developed and endorsed by the collaboration of NASADAD and NASMHPD in 1998, has been promoted as a conceptual model to demonstrate how Mental Health (MH) and Substance Abuse (SA) Disorders relate to each other (co-occur), and how MH and SA treatment systems interact in serving persons with co-occurring disorders. The National Dialogue proposed a “quadrant model,” a four box matrix composed of combinations of Low and High severities of Mental Health and Substance Abuse problem severities.
While the Co-occurring Matrix makes conceptual and clinical sense – i.e. has high face validity – it has never been subjected to systematic evaluation.  For example, the National Dialogue describes, in broad terms, the characteristics of the Co-occurring Quadrant Model categories (LL, LH, HL, and HH), but does not supply any specific methodology for screening an individual to determine whether the person may “fit” within into one or another quadrant.  Such a screening tool would allow treatment providers to quickly assess and plan for which types or mixes of types of co-occurring disorders patients might be in a given population, and thus develop the appropriate mix of services for this population, according to the logic of the matrix.  Further, the National Dialogue makes assumptions about the preferred locus of care for various LH categories in each quadrant, however, since no tool has been developed to place cases, this locus of care model has never been tested using a clinical data base.

Therefore, the need exists to operationalize definitions for the Low and High categories for each of the quadrants and then obtain data on the relative numbers and characteristics of cases in each quadrant for a given clinical site, (in this purchase order, a busy urban emergency room).  From these operational definitions, a specific screening tool may be developed that can reliably classify persons with co-occurring disorders into the four quadrants.  This REQUIREMENT will support the development and validation of such a tool, the Co-occurring Matrix Screening Tool or CMaST.  The CMaST will be used to re-evaluate the same individuals one and 3 months afer the initial screening, and after their crisis, to see if the screening tool picks up changes in their MH or SA severities, and if there is a corresponding change in Matrix category.  A strength of this project is that it will evaluate emergency patients, who are often the ones for whom planning is most needed

 The University of Washington has published numerous research articles on authorship of the major SAMHSA/CSAT publications on the topic of co-occurring disorders, and the association with the Quadrant Model, the University has the expertise and reputation necessary to develop a credible screening instrument.
Most critically, activities through this requirement are reliant on access the a large database on over 10,000 admissions to emergency mental health and substance abuse services at the Harborview Medical Center.  The purposes of the requirement  are entirely dependent on access to this database, from which items for the screening tool will be drawn, and based on which the quadrant model will be evaluated.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Association of State Mental Health Directors, Alexandria, VA .

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to provide technical assistance to SMHA’s in developing services programs for women and trauma through the brokerage of WCDVS findings to raise awareness and knowledge, and facilitate implementation by State Mental Health Systems and provider agencies of trauma-informed systems and emerging best trauma treatment models emanating from the WCDVS study. Policy analysis will be undertaken regarding critical issues in the implementation of these findings in community-based and residential settings, and implementation guidelines will be developed.
The Women, Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence Study (WCDVS) was a five-year initiative jointly supported by the three centers of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)-the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, the Center for Mental Health Services and the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. Knowledge gained from the WCDVS is expected to be useful in advancing national, state and local policy that affects how the various service systems respond to these women with co-occurring disorders who have histories of violence and their children. 
To facilitate the dissemination of the findings and research based clinical knowledge learned from the study into actual treatment settings across the country, a technical assistance project was initiated in September 2003 by NASMHPD with support from SAMHSA/CMHS.  This project developed and implemented a variety of strategies to disseminate the findings and to bring the emerging best practice models for working with women with co-occurring disorders and histories of violence from the WCDVS study to NASMHPD Division Directors, the National Research Institute Inc., and State Mental Health Agencies across the country. 
NASMHPD is an organization that establishes policy, coordinates state activities, and serves as a consultant and advisor to the state mental health administrations in their policy and programmatic initiatives bearing responsibility for the range of issues under the purview of state mental health authorities. This relationship provides a natural opportunity for NASMHPD state governments on a variety of topics and constantly emerging challenges.  The capacities required to do this work – convening mental health state and community leaders to engage in policy analysis and follow-though activities, engagement of consumer and advocacy groups, translation of WCDVS findings in a manner consonant with the expressed needs and styles of action of NASMHPD members, and, development of policies that are specifically targeted to address women’s trauma service needs in services delivery systems, coupled with a sophisticated mix of analysis and implementation skills.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), Arlington, VA .

Purpose:

The goal of this project is to educate members of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill about Medicaid mental health services for the purpose of assisting them to meaningfully contribute to State efforts to improve planning for Medicaid mental health services, and to incorporate such planning into a comprehensive State mental health plan.
Over the past decade Medicaid has been an ever-increasing payer of mental health services in the states.  It has reached the point where Medicaid pays over half of all public mental health services administered by states.  If current trends continue the percentage will reach two-thirds in the not too distant future.
Currently, there is only limited information by which to understand Medicaid’s support of mental health services and to incorporate that information into state MH policies.   State mental health authorities are called on to provide services through state psychiatric hospitals and local mental health programs and often are seen as responsible for all services within the state.  However, effective management of public mental health systems is unlikely to be achieved without policies that recognizing the ever increasing role of Medicaid as the primary source of reimbursement for state-level mental health services.

It is critical for consumer and family representatives to be able to understand and contribute to discussions about Medicaid in their states.  However, Medicaid is a very complicated program, with a myriad of federal and state laws and rules impacting on how it operates.  To improve knowledge of Medicaid MH services, CMHS wishes to support efforts to provide education and other information to groups concerned with State MH services and policies in Medicaid.  Using this information, regional meetings will bring together local and state mental health system advocates, family and consumer groups, and selected Medicaid officials to build concrete strategies for state action.



	NAMI has a comprehensive and experienced network of grassroots members who are actively involved in issues affecting their states= systems of care.  

	NAMI has state offices in virtually every state with staff who work closely with local affiliates and members on state policy priorities.  NAMI's state organizations have the capacity, infrastructure and leadership necessary to respond quickly and effectively when issues arise.  NAMI's state leaders also have the capacity and experience to develop, organize, and conduct training and technical assistance on Medicaid and related funding and systems design issues.

	Most NAMI state organizations have been in existence for twenty years, with a long and successful history of leading or working within diverse coalitions on a broad range of disability, mental health and health policy issues at state and local levels.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Badging System
<SOLNBR>FY5866-04-R-0011
<RESPDATE>042504
<CONTACT>Ellen  Adams, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-239-9224, Fax 703-239-9227, Email adamse@orha.centcom.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer more questions.  They are as follows:

Question:  What is the intended application for the badging system (i.e. photo ID card only, photo ID card with access control, photo id/fingerprint embedded for access control, permits, etc.)?  Answer:  Photo ID card with fingerprint embedded.  The finger print is for security purposes.

Question: Does a standard layout for the badge exist?  If no, how many badge layout templates should be included as part of the training/labor?  If yes, would a copy of the badge layout be provided?  Answer:  Yes on the Access Data base there is a layout containing NAME, RANK, IAF SERIAL NUMBER, PHOTO, FINGER PRINT, ISSUE DATE, AND EXPERATION DATE.  You can also add any additional information to the layout if you want.  

Question:   Will the badging stations be networked between the various facilities/badging stations (i.e. all stations sharing one database)?  Answer:  No the databases will remain separate.

Question:  If networking is required, who shall provide the infrastructure for the network (i.e. CAT5, fiber or microwave communications between the 15 or more badging stations/sites)?  Answer:  Not required.

Question:  does your current security protocol allow for remote access to the badging stations for the purpose of providing technical support, troubleshooting and training assistance to personnel rotating, etc?  Answer:  No, they do not have remote access to the station—you have to get the whole computer and work on it.

Question:  Is Microsoft Access the only option for the database?  Are systems that utilize MSSQL and provides a more reliable, robust, ad secure database system satisfactory:  Answer:  The access program is the way that the CPA makes their ID cards—a MSSQL is too complicated to use and too expensive.

Question:  What is the purpose of the fingerprint reader (i.e. biometric access thru doors, to print the fingerprint on the ID card, to output the fingerprint to other sites/stations, to act as alternative to password control to the badging station, etc.)?  Answer:  The purpose of the fingerprint reader is to print the fingerprint on the ID card.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify questions as follows:

1.  Is tech support via phone allowable?  Answer: Tech support can be via phone.

2.  Are the units to be installed by the offerer and is the training to be in Iraq?  If the installation and training are in Iraq, are they all at the CPA Republican Palace or othr locations?  Answer:  Contractor should send a technical person to the palace with the first shipment to set up and train our people on the use of this system.  Future deliveries will not require a technical person traveling to Baghdad.  Once our folks are trained, we will train others at our sites, so the contractor will not be required to go to each site.
