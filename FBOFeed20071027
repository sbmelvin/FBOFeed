Two twelve man mobile and stationary M16/M4/M203 training teams will facilitate and execute the approved training curriculum at the Regional Training Centers (RTC), Division Training Centers(DTC), and other locations as deemed necessary by the Iraqi and US governments. This part of the requirement addresses the training scope of the initiative to train trainers and soldiers on the M16A4, M4 and M203 weapons systems. The immediate need is to field M-16 series weapons to the Iraqi Army. The concurrent objective is to instill in unit Officer and NCO leaders the ability and the desire to train and sustain their own soldiers' marksmanshipskills.                                                                                The Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) intends to issue a Request For Proposal for the procurement of training transition facilitators throughout Iraq in Support of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I) on or about 23 Oct 07.  The Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT) has requirements for contractors to assist the Iraqi Government in the development, organization, training, and sustainment of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).  The Training Transition Facilitator Contract will procure services to train ISF trainers, leaders, and commanders in the implementation and execution of training programs designed to build individual leader skills; squad, platoon, and company collective task and battlefield operating systems skills; and battalion staff collective task skills.   The primary purpose of these services is to develop doctrine and training curriculum, and to facilitate the implementation and execution of approved training curriculum.  Contractor personnel will be embedded with Iraqi Security Force (ISF) personnel in order to facilitate the training process.  

To efficiently and effectively fulfill these requirements the MNSTC-I Support Division intends to award a single award, Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The resultant contract will be comprised of a one year base period with two, one-year option periods.  The anticipated award date for any resultant contract is 20 Dec 07.  Award will be made pursuant to a written solicitation which will be made available through http://www.baghdadbusinesscenter.org and on the Rebuilding Iraq web site at https://www.rebuilding-iraq.net .  JCC-I/A will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources.
