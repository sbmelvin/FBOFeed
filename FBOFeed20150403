<DESC><p>THIS SYNOPSIS/PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE NO. R15PS00790 REPLACES PREVIOUSLY POSTED SYNOPSIS/PRE-SOLICITATION NO. R15PS00719.</p>
<p><br />The Department of the Interior / Bureau of Reclamation Mid-Pacific Region intends to issue a Solicitation for a firm fixed-price construction contract for the Trinity Dam Intake Mechanical Equipment Refurbishing/Gate Shaft Refurbishing (Phase 1) project. This procurement is set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business [SDVOSB] concerns. It will be a negotiated procurement that will consider past performance, technical capabilities, and cost/price in the award decision. The work to be performed is described below. The applicable North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] Code is 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering and the related small business size standard is $36.5M. The estimated cost of this project is from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.00. This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.</p>
<p>Work is located approximately 8 miles north of Lewiston, California, in Trinity County at the Trinity Dam.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.</p>
<p>Solicitation R15PS00790 will be posted electronically via Federal Business Opportunities/FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) on or about May 11, 2015. The date for receipt of offers will be approximately June 11, 2015. The solicitation must be downloaded at the above website; no paper copy of this solicitation will be distributed.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) applies to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on SAM registration can be obtained at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p><br />PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF WORK: <br />The procurement is a heavy civil construction project and requires the installation of mechanical equipment. This project consists of the following:</p>
<p>&bull;Remove calcium carbonate (Calcite) buildup from walls of the valve Bonnet Chamber, gate shaft, and both slots for Fixed Wheel Gate, and perform a Proof-by-Demonstration that the gate slots accommodate future removal of the Gate. <br />&bull; Survey walls and pressure grout the cracks identified on the cleaned wall and slot surfaces.<br />&bull; Refurbish joints of the 24-inch pipe and the 20-inch pipe; furnish and install restraint supports.<br />&bull; Design, furnish, install and test an Electro-Osmotic Pulse System Calcite mitigation system in the Gate Shaft.</p>
<p>The valve Chamber is located inside the dam and accessed from below through a 1,242-foot long access tunnel, climbing two non-standard flights of ladders (aka Ship Ladders) in the access shaft, traveling down an approximately 100-foot long tunnel and passing a 42-inch diameter water tight portal. The valve chamber can also be accessed from above via a 375-foot high gate shaft.</p>
<p>This work requires design and fabrication of scaffolds or construction aids which must be transported into the dam via circuitous routes. This work requires removal of waste Calcite materials from work sites using scaffolds or construction aids. The Calcite must be transported out of the dam via circuitous routes without impacts to existing facilities, equipment, or impacting drains. This work requires surveying and documenting walls for cracks, pressure grouting the cracks identified on the cleaned wall and slot surfaces, and repairing joints and installing additional pipe supports for 20 and 24-inch diameter wet well and air vent piping. The Offeror must develop a plan and method to prove that the gate slots are 100% clear of calcite to allow the removal of the gate at a later time. Removal of the actual gate is not included in this procurement. This work requires designing, furnishing, installing, and testing an Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) calcite mitigation system. There is a positive security requirement at the site.</p>
<p><br />Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Jeremy Bedner by email at jbedner@usbr.gov.</p>

<a href="mailto:jonathan.bodus@ang.af.mil">CRTC-Alpena/MSC Office</a>
<DESC>The Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, MI, is soliciting for a bid-build project to repair the base electrical distribution as per the specifications and drawings provided.  This is a restricted solicitation that has been set-aside for HUBzone certified  businesses qualified under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 236220, and is intended to be a single award action.  DESCRIPTION:  All work indicated in the contract documents, drawings, statements of work and specifications for TDVG112848 Repair Base Electrical Distribution System at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC). The Contractor shall provide all plant, labor, material and supervision necessary to accomplish the work described herein.  <br> A general summary of the project is below:  a. Power distribution at Alpena CRTC consists of two separate 12.47 kV systems; the main base system and the munitions system. The main base system is primary metered only at the primary power point of connection, and the munitions system is also metered. The alternate connection is not metered. Each system consists of both overhead and underground lines. The main base power system has a primary and alternate power source supplied by separate PIEG feeders (Presque Isle Electric and Gas).  b. The main base system currently consisting of a mix of loop fed and radial areas will be converted to a loop following Falcon Ave, D Street, H Street, and the existing underground lines south of Hercules Ave. Radials off of the main loop will be used to serve transformers. The circuit west of H Street will remain radially fed. The River Club/campground circuit is also radially fed and will remain as such.  c. With a few exceptions, each transformer is supplied by a dedicated pad mounted switch to allow for de-energizing the transformer without single phasing the building.  d. The main base system project includes demolition of all overhead lines and installation of new underground lines. New underground lines will be installed in a new concrete duct bank and manhole system. New cables will be pulled in existing conduits where necessary for new terminations. The duct bank routes were selected to minimize crossing of existing pavements, and underground and above ground obstructions. Directional boring will be used to install HDPE conduit at road, pavement, and stream crossings. The project is phased to minimize power outage times to buildings. Temporary power will be provided to critical buildings and to other buildings required to be down for an extended period of time during the construction.  e. The munitions area system is radially supplied only and is fused at 40 amps. The munitions area system supplies 475 kVA of transformers (21 amps). The plan includes undergrounding the power line to the edge of the base's property.  f. Buildings which are currently supplied by overhead secondary conductors from pole mounted transformers will be connected by new underground secondary laterals.  Estimated cost of the base bid and any alternates is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Bids must be valid for 90 days after the bid due date.  Interested contractors that qualify under these conditions are encouraged to participate and can obtain a copy of the solicitation, statement of work, and specifications/drawings and solicitation by going to the website www.fbo.gov or will receive instructions on how they may be obtained.  All prospective offerors must have a commercial and government entity code (CAGE Code) and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.   The solicitation shall be posted to the website on or about 1 May 2015.    There will be a site visit conducted.  The time and date of the site visit shall be established in the solicitation.  The anticipated award date is 1 Jul 2015.   This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Government's ultimate approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost, the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or substituting a response to this notice. Please provide responses in writing via e-mail to jonthan.bodus@ang.af.mil no later than 18 Apr 2015.   <br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The US Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&rsquo;s (USDOT/NHTSA) Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) conducts research and evaluation projects related to behaviors and attitudes in highway safety issues.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Child restraint systems are effective at reducing the risk of injury during motor vehicle crashes.&nbsp; In 1998, NHTSA implemented a program for training and certifying child passenger safety technicians (CPSTs). Presently, Safe Kids Worldwide hosts Child Car Seat Inspection Stations nationwide which provide parents and caregivers an opportunity to receive one-on-one instruction regarding proper use and installation of child restraints from a certified CPST. Unfortunately, this resource seems to be underutilized. In fact, unpublished results from a recent NHTSA study show that approximately 9 percent of parents/caregivers interviewed reported having visited an inspection station. At present, it is unclear what obstructs and what encourages use of this resource. One potential barrier is parent/caregiver overconfidence such that overconfident parents and caregivers do not recognize the need to visit an inspection station or CPST<a name="_ftnref1" href="file:///K:/Contracts/2015%20CPS%20Info%20Resources/Synopsis%201st%20Draft%2015-R-00018.doc#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">[1]</span></span></span></a>. In addition, lack of awareness and availability (e.g., distance, long waiting lists for appointments) may be barriers to the use of CPST/inspection stations. The objective of this study is to evaluate these barriers and determine what the reasons are for a low attendance rate. Given that research has shown hands-on instruction is effective for reducing installation errors<a name="_ftnref2" href="file:///K:/Contracts/2015%20CPS%20Info%20Resources/Synopsis%201st%20Draft%2015-R-00018.doc#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">[2]</span></span></span></a>, it is reasonable to postulate that increasing CPST/inspection station use will translate to a reduction in CRS misuse. Ultimately, reducing misuse would increase the protective value of CRSs and reduce injuries and fatalities. Thus, determining what prevents parents/caregivers from using an inspection station will inform strategies to promote use of them.&nbsp;</p>

<SUBJECT>Fatigue in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems
<SOLNBR>DTNH2215R00022
<CONTACT>Brian Jenkins, Email NhtsaOam@dot.gov
<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).&nbsp; NHTSA&rsquo;s mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. The agency develops, promotes, implements, and supports effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The availability of medical care provided by EMS workers is necessary at all times, day or night. This requirement has led to circumstances where EMS workers across the entire industry are working in sleep deprived and fatigued states &ndash; a very dangerous situation. A number of recently published scientific articles have demonstrated that not only is severe fatigue present in around 50% of EMS providers surveyed but that drowsy or fatigued EMS providers are substantially more likely to be injured on the job, commit a medical error, or perform a safety-compromising behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 2013, the National EMS Advisory Council (NEMSAC) issued an advisory proposing that NHTSA explore the issue of fatigue in EMS systems. The following three recommendations were submitted to NHTSA:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">1. The NHTSA Office of EMS (OEMS) should cross-validate findings from studies and reports of fatigue in other professions with that of fatigue in EMS. This effort should involve a convening of subject matter experts, individual providers of EMS services, and representatives from local, state, and federal organizations, national organizations (e.g., NAEMT, NAEMSP, and NASEMSO) that play a role in EMS oversight or care delivery. The effort should clarify the evidence linking EMS provider fatigue and safety and health outcomes of patients, providers, and the public. The effort should include an analysis of regulatory requirements of the employer and employee and legal framework with respect to the threat of fatigue on safety.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">2. The NHTSA Office of EMS (OEMS) should work through its federal and non-federal partners to address the lack of a standardized method for investigating the role of fatigue in ground and air-medical crashes, clinical errors, and provider injuries. This effort may include developing a valid and reliable measurement tool and check list for investigators.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;">3. The NHTSA Office of EMS (OEMS) should disseminate (evidence-based) information to the EMS community to aid development of fatigue management programs / interventions to fit local needs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, NOAA, Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) division has a requirement to design and manufacture one (1) trawl to capture age-0 pollock (25 to 140 millimeters or 1.0 to 5.5 inches length) and other pelagic forage fish species. This net will be used to conduct oblique tows, surface tows, or depth targeted tows to provide an index of abundance and samples of age-0 pollock and other forage fish species. The first delivery of one (1) trawl is required on July 1, 2015. The requirement will also have an option for additional modifications to the designed trawl and an option for up to two (2) additional trawls. These options are based on the trawl performance in the eastern Bering Sea during September 2015. The final delivery is required on or before March 2016.
<p>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts regular, comprehensive fish and oceanographic surveys in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS). Data from these surveys are utilized in stock assessment and fishery evaluation (SAFE) documents, in Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEA), and in &lsquo;end to end' ecosystems models (e.g. FEAST) to understand groundfish recruitment processes and salmon marine survival. These surveys are among the 2014 &lsquo;Critical Research Priorities' for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The research supports the AFSC core research foci, including the maintenance of information and capabilities needed to support groundfish stock assessments. The fisheries and oceanographic surveys in the SEBS are designed to improve our collective understanding of fisheries and oceanographic ecosystem indices in the SEBS and to clarify mechanisms linking recent and continued climate-mediated changes in ocean conditions with fish recruitment.</p>
<p>These surveys require a midwater trawl to collect age-0 walleye pollock and other forage fish species. The trawl must be deployable from the NOAA ship Oscar Dyson and from contracted commercial trawl vessels. A midwater trawl (the Stauffer trawl a.k.a. modified Cobb trawl or anchovy trawl) is currently used by the AFSC to sample age-0 pollock and other forage fish species.</p>
<p>The requirements for the trawl will consist of a meeting to discuss design specifications; design approval and manufacturing; and, design testing.</p>
<p>A solicitation will be issued on or about April 13, 2015 defining the technical description of the trawl and components.</p>
<p>This is a full and open competition and all business sizes can submit quotes. The small business NAICS code for this requirement is 314999 with a 500 employee size standard. The Government intends to acquire this trawl using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures estimated not to exceed $150,000.00. Any resulting purchase order will be a Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order. Request for Quotation (RFQ) documents with specifications will be made available for download on or about April 17, 2015 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps features which provide a notification when the RFQ becomes available for download as well as all postings of information associated with this RFQ.

<DESC>Construct a Vertical Electro-Magnetic Pulse Simulator, Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland.  Also referred to as the Vertical Polarized Bounded Wave Simulator, it shall be large enough to test 747 sized aircrafts.  The simulator is used to test the vulnerability of electronic systems to the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) produced by a high altitude nuclear burst by subjecting the systems to a simulated EMP environment. The EMP environment is created using a complex array of horizontal and vertical wires which extend hundreds of feet from a single initiation point.  Horizontal wires will be installed within an expansive system of specialized cast-in-place conductive concrete specified by the Government.
  

This antenna is comprised of a ground plane that will act as the bottom plate of the antenna, supporting test aircraft on a conductive concrete ground plane with embedded antenna leads.  The top plate of the antenna includes the aboveground antenna cabling and supporting poles with their associated lightening protection and airfield safety lighting.  A small shelter will house the VEMP generator, which will send current through the top and bottom plates, thereby enveloping a test object in simulated nuclear conditions.

<SUBJECT>B--It is the Navys intent to contract on a limited source basis to acquire continued support for model functionality enhancements from either QinetiQ LTD or Decision Analysis Services LTD.

<CONTACT>Shawn Thomas 215-697-9619 Rosemary McWilliams

<DESC>Notice is hereby provided of the Navys intent to contract on a limited source basis to acquire continued support for maintenance and model functionality enhancements and operator training from either QinetiQ LTD or Decision Analysis Services LTD for the Navys Operating and Support Cost Analysis Model (OSCAM). The original OSCAM model development was a cooperative venture between the U.S. Navy and the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MoD).  HVR Consulting Services Limited, did the original Ship and Ship Systems model development, developed and taught the models training courses, and executed a complete Ships model revision including updating the architecture of the model to object-oriented programming replacing a hodge-podge model structure, and assisted in updating the ship operating and support business rules to ensure that the models behavior reflected current operational concepts and procedures.
  HVR used these efforts for The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program Office to build a JSF-unique OSCAM model. Subsequently; the Government leveraged ongoing efforts to build the JSF model and upgrade the Navys OSCAM Air model architecture, structure, and business rules. In 2009, QinetiQ, LTD acquired HVR and all the data and process rights held by HVR.  Over the next several years, HVR employees involved in the OSCAM development process since its inception left QinetiQ employment.  Several of these former QinetiQ employees have joined former colleagues in their own consulting business, Decision Analytic Services (DAS). DAS represents the only known offeror outside of the incumbent deemed capable of performing the complex tasks in the PWS and delivering a superior service, whether in model enhancement or in curriculum and delivery.
 OSCAM is a simulation model that seeks to represent the operating and support (O and S) business processes allowing cost engineers, systems engineers, logisticians and planners to develop robust operating and support (O and S) cost estimates for budgeting, as inputs to Analyses of Alternatives (AOAs), and assess source selections.  The OSCAM models are Systems Dynamics-based models that perform time-stepped calculations within and among different model sectors to simulate ship and aircraft costs throughout the O and S phase of the platforms lifecycle.  These tools are far and above more complex and comprehensive than any MS Excel-based cost model. Much of the level of effort required in this PWS is dedicated to conducting training on use of the models.
  The majority of the students undergoing this training are Navy cost analysts with widely varying degrees of experience. The government data supplied with the model undergoes specific formatting to be incorporated into the model.  Changing the fundamental architecture of the OSCAM model will require re-processing of the VAMOSC data to fit the new model shell, adding significantly to the cost of producing, testing, and deploying a new model. An important component in the delivery of OSCAM training courses is the ability to explain both complex modeling characteristics/capabilities and cost estimating concepts and methodologies to a class of students with varying technical backgrounds and levels of experience.
 The successful offeror must have an integrated skill set that satisfies all of the tasks contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  These skill sets include: Expert systems dynamics modeling capability, Knowledge of cost estimating methods and procedures and excellent communications skills. The successful offeror must be able to develop, execute, and perform verification and validation (V and V) enhancements to existing models and introduction of new models and address technical questions of how the model works, and how to apply the model in real-life situations. It would be prohibitive from both a price and time standpoint, for any other firm to replicate the system and/or previously provided training, thereby resulting in a detrimental impact to the NCCA mission.
  The U.S. government has retained ownership of the data used to populate the model.  Specifically, this effort will provide enhancements to OSCAM functionality, upgrades to comply with the requirements of the NMCI environment, and continued training for prospective OSCAM users. More over; QinetiQ Ltd and Decision Analysis Services, Ltd are the only companies that have knowledge intimate enough to satisfactorily support this requirement. Subsequently, it is the Governments intention to negotiate a limited source contract in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.
  The period of performance for these services includes one annual base period with four annual options.  This is not a request for quotes, instead interested parties may submit capability information in order to challenge this intent to for a limited source contract with either QinetiQ Ltd or DAS by 13 April 2015 to Shawn.Thomas1@navy.mil; however the final decision to process this requirement on a competitive vice sole source basis (as depicted herein) rests with the Navy.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid for Repairs to the Jetties in Newburyport Harbor at Salisbury and Newburyport, MA.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is between $8,000,000 and $12,000,000.   <br>  <br> The proposed work consists of repairing the 3100-foot-long North Jetty in Salisbury and completing repairs to the remaining (most seaward) 140 feet of the 1,500-foot-long South Jetty in Newburyport that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy.  Approximately 30,000 tons of armor stone will be required - including approximately 5,000 tons of 14- to 19-ton armor stone.  Crest width varies from 5 to 15 feet.  Crest elevation at the most seaward end is +12.3 feet mean lower low water (mllw), and +17.3 mllw at the landward end.  Side slopes are 1 vertical:1 horizontal on the river side and 2 horizontal:1 vertical on the ocean side.  The work includes replacing displaced core and armor stone to fill in existing gaps in the jetty.  Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement.  Work also includes repair of a 190-foot-long stone spur off the North Jetty, approximately 600 feet seaward from the beginning of the jetty, and removal of two Navigation Aids (metal towers and concrete bases) from the North Jetty, and installation of new concrete bases.  About 6 days per month during the construction window seas can be expected to be in excess of 8 feet in the river mouth. Stone deliveries to the jetties shall be done by water for the seaward half of the North Jetty and for the entire 140-foot portion of the South Jetty.  Equipment and stone delivery and access to the jetty may be performed from land, water, or a combination for the landward half of the North Jetty.  It is expected that there will be no seasonal constraints on the work.  The expected storage/staging area for the stone, equipment, and trailer is on MA Department of Conservation & Recreation (DCR) property in Salisbury.  Any DCR property, including the parking lot, dunes, and any excess vegetation damaged will be restored to their pre-construction condition.   <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time.

When two or more indefinite delivery contracts (IDCs) available to the procuring agency contain the same or overlapping scopes of work so that a particular task order might be issued under more than one IDC, the contracting officer will have available for consideration the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, uniquely specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, and equitable distribution of work among the contractors.  For any task order requiring OCONUS work, the Contractor shall visit the Department of State website to view the Treatise in Force at http://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/tif/index.htm, for any current treaties and other international agreements in place, specific to the country(ies) identified in the task order, as it will be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with such, as may be applicable.  Country(ies) where work has been performed thus far via task order(s) under incumbent IDCs for these services include:  Bahrain.  Future OCONUS performance locations may include Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Turkey and Germany (list may not be all inclusive).  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $15,000,000 in annual average gross receipts over the past three years.  This announcement is open to both Small and Other than Small (OTS) service providers.  Both Small and OTS Offerors will be evaluated on the extent of participation of small business community (SBC) members in the performance of the acquisition.  Offerors are required to meet the minimum mandatory total small business participation objective/target of 20% of total acquisition value to SBC members.  Offerors proposing a higher objective/target of 20% will receive a more favorable evaluation.  SBC members can propose work they will self-perform toward small business participation objectives.  The small business subcontracting goals for this acquisition will be calculated based on the apparent successful Offeror(s)' proposed small business participation objective (i.e. target percentage) of total acquisition value.  The following informational percentages for identified small business categories are considered reasonable and achievable for the performance period of the resultant IDCs:  a. 40% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed with all small business concerns (SB); b. 3% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged concerns (SDB).  NOTE: b. is a subset of a. (Count firm in all applicable areas.); c. 7% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed with small women owned business concerns (WOSB).  NOTE: c. is a subset of a.  Also, the WOSB may meet the definition of a SDB.  If so, c. will also be a subset of b.  (Count firm in all applicable areas.); d. 1% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed with Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns.  NOTE: d. is a subset of a.  A HUBZone firm may also be SDB, WOSB and/or VOSB.  (Count firm in all applicable areas.); e. 2% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed with Veteran Owned Small Business concerns (VOSB).  NOTE: e. is a subset of a. (Count firm in all applicable areas.); f. 3% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB).  NOTE: f. is a subset of a. and e. (Count firm in all applicable areas.); g. 2.5% of planned subcontracting dollars will be placed with Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs).  NOTE: g. is a subset of a. (Count firm in all applicable areas.)   The Subcontracting Plan is NOT required with this submittal.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.7 and FAR Clause 52.219-9, if an other-than-small (i.e. 'large') business firm(s) is selected, it will be required to submit a detailed Subcontracting Plan.  Submission of such by the selected firm will be required with its price proposal, to be reviewed, negotiated and approved in parallel with the price negotiation (note that Subcontracting Plans are not required from SBCs).  The acceptable Subcontracting Plan will be incorporated into the basic IDC award, as a material part of the contract.  Minimum negotiated goals, progress and achievement will be monitored and evaluated through the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  If the contractor fails to comply in good faith with the approved plan, the Contracting Officer may take action in accordance with FAR 52.219-16 'Liquidated Damages - Subcontracting Plan'.  If the selected firm fails to negotiate a Subcontracting Plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer, then the offeror will be ineligible for award.  Award of the first of the two targeted contracts is anticipated between September and November 2015.  Award of the second of the two targeted contracts is anticipated between December 2015 and February 2016.  To be eligible for contract award, the Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).  Registration is free and can be accessed at: http://www.sam.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO AND WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM POTENTIAL SOURCES AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.<br /> <br />The 633d Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB, Virginia is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Pavement contract that will cover requirements on Langley AFB and Ft Eustis military installations. This is a Sources Sought announcement; a market survey for written information only. This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing work which includes all materials, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, supervision, management and other services (including engineering/technical design support) necessary for maintaining base paved areas.  The work may include, but is not limited to, the following: excavation; surface preparation; placing base course; asphaltic concrete and overlays; sealing of pavement; repair of existing concrete sidewalks, curb and gutter, airfield pavement slabs and spalls; repair of airfield box drains; removal of paint from airfield and base pavements; painting of stripes on airfield and base pavements.  Painting of airfield pavements shall conform to the requirements of Air Force Instructions 32-1042, STANDARDS FOR MARKING AIRFIELDS.  Also included in the contract will be placing new sidewalks, new concrete curb and gutter, resetting of manholes and catch basins as required, and pothole repairs.  All work shall be accomplished in accordance with contract documents and most recent Federal and state regulations.<br /><br /><br />
<p>The 633d Air Base Wing is seeking those firms with a demonstrated history of relevant paving experience where the primary focus is on IDIQ-type contracts with simultaneous performance of multiple projects at differing locations similar to the task order value that will be executed under this contract.  Task orders will be firm-fixed price with an estimated targeting award range of $2,000 to $5,000,000. The estimated magnitude of the entire IDIQ contract will be from $25,000,000 to $100,000,000.  The US Government anticipates awarding a base year contract with four option years.  The following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code will apply to this acquisition: 237310 Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.  The description of work will be identified in each individual task order. Performance and payment bonds will be required per individual delivery order in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 28.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the FedBizOpps website for program documents. Firms responding to this sources sought notice must (1) be located in the Mid-Atlantic Region defined as Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, Delaware, and Pennsylvania; (2) state whether they are small or large business based on the size standard above; if applicable, identify subcontractors to be used and their anticipated responsibilities; (3) indicate any applicable small business status categories; (4) provide a summary of capabilities to include: experience for airfield projects and other specific relevant work completed of equivalent magnitude, and firm's ability to handle a large number of projects simultaneously. Because the Government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a) firms, HUB Zone firms or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business based on the responses it receives, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information for capabilities to be accurately evaluated. Potential offerors should limit their responses to three (3) pages (single spaced, 12 pt font). All information included in offeror responses should be specific to this Sources Sought synopsis.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought announcement are due NLT 20 April 2015 by 1:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>The response shall be sent by mail to: 633d Contracting Squadron (Attn: SrA Brittany Ballew), 74 Nealy Ave, Langley AFB, Virginia, 23665-2088, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and </strong></span>electronically to brittany.ballew.1@us.af.mil.</p>

Please include relevant work in collaboration with any high performance computing organization. <p> The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses. <p> IV. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH <p> The Government is soliciting contracting approaches to the NASA Advanced Computing Services (NACS) contract that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities. Therefore, the Government is requesting feedback on the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: <p> a)Socio-economic considerations: ARC is interested in your comments on establishing subcontracting goals for Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,  and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NACS. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. The current contract subcontracting goals are as follows: <p> Small Business 14% Small Disadvantaged Business 5% Women-Owned Small Business 5% HUBZone 1% Total Small Business Concerns 25% <p> b) Performance-Based Contracting (PBC): ARC is interested in your comments on Performance-Based Contracting (PBC). If you have specific experience with PBC in support of similar contracts, please include your experience and opinion of measurable performance standards as it relates to the technical areas described in the Draft SOW. <p> c) Contract Period of Performance Duration: ARC is interested in your comments on how long the total contract period of performance should be based on your ability to provide cost estimate information. ARC is considering a contract performance period longer than five (5) years. <p> d) Use of Cost Plus Award Fee/Award Term: ARC is considering the use of a cost plus award fee/award term structure to evaluate technical performance, schedule, and cost. <p> ARC is interested in motivating contractors to provide excellent performance during the life of a contract through a new incentive plan called "award term." Award term is considered a non-monetary incentive that can stand alone or be used in combination with other contract incentives. It is a disciplined process used to determine whether to continue a longer-term business relationship with a contractor. The award term evaluation process mirrors that of award fee; however, award term evaluations are based, to a greater extent, on objective metrics. NASA has utilized this new contracting approach in several cases under a pilot program. <p> In an attempt to determine the feasibility of a cost plus award fee/award term approach for this particular procurement, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include answers to the following questions: <p> 1) Performance incentives: Please provide your view regarding award fee, award term, and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance. <p> 2) Here are some sample incentive evaluation factors. How would you propose to measure factors such as the technical/cost/schedule performance, risk mitigation, employee and asset safety and security, innovative best practices, quality of service to users, extraordinary mission impacts, multi-facility synergy, bringing in new customers and users, responsiveness to changing requirements and budget, partnering with HPC vendors for new system development, or identifying opportunities for technical and administrative improvement? <p> 3) What type of award fee evaluation factors would you recommend for this type of procurement? <p> 4) What type award term factors would you recommend for this type of procurement? <p> 5) Would use of an award term incentive properly motivate contractor performance on the follow-on contract and why? <p> 6) Would you submit a proposal if a solicitation is issued for the follow-on contract with the award term incentive and why? <p> 7) Have you had experience with Award Term Contracting? If yes, please provide the name of the Government agency who awarded the contract, the contract number, a brief description of the work, the Contracting Officer's contact information, and your perception of whether this did or did not incentivize performance. <p> e) Data: What type of technical information along with the Statement of Work would you like to see with a potential solicitation (e.g., sample tasks, information on the computer systems and other major resources currently being supported, best practices questions)? <p> f) Contract Content/Structure: Do you have any suggestions or examples of restructuring, simplifications, and clarity in the description of technical areas (Draft SOW) as well as other types of additional information that would improve understanding or clarity of requirements and terms and conditions? <p> There is no limit on the page length to your response to PART IV. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH. <p> V. YOUR RESPONSE TO THE SYNOPSIS <p> All responses to: 1) the Statement of Capabilities and 2) Contracting Approach shall be received no later than Thursday, April 30, 2014 at 4:00PM Local PST.  Please respond via electronic mail (email) to the Contracting Officer, Veronica L.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: <br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892.
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 611310 - Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools - and the associated small business size standard of $25.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>Background Information:  <br />The purpose of the proposed work is to measure the volume of several brain areas outside the temporal lobe after lesions of the hippocampus in the non-human primate.</p>
<p>Research in the Section on Cognitive Neuroscience focuses on Cerebral Systems for Perception and Memory, both in monkeys and in normal and brain-injured children and young adults.  Besides employing cross-species comparisons, the work is highly multidisciplinary, as it utilizes behavioral, neurosurgical, neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, pharmacological, and neuroimaging methods.  The main goal is to uncover and delineate new, as well as refine already established, multiple parallel cerebral systems or functional circuits that mediate different aspects of higher-order sensory processing in vision and audition, as well as the encoding and storing of this sensory information into different forms of memory.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Acquisition: <br />This purpose of this potential purchase order is to have the volume of different brain structures (e.g. thalamus, mammillary bodies, white matter) measured in monkeys after hippocampal lesions.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements <br />The contractor requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull;  Make morphometric measurements of white matter and subcortical structures using high resolution T1-weighted MRI images of the non-human primate brain provided by our lab.</p>
<p>&bull;  Measure global grey matter, white matter and cerebro-spinal fluid volumes to be derived from SPM8 segmentation protocol.</p>
<p>&bull;  Measure the volumes of the anterior and posterior thalamus, pulvinar, and mammillary bodies in the brains of 8 non-human primates with hippocampal lesions and 8 normal controls. Initial brain volumes will be segmented manually as well as automatically using BRAINS2 and FSL FIRST software on T1-weighted MR images acquired on a 4.7 Tesla Bruker scanner.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:<br />It is anticipated that the period of performance for this requirement will be six (6) months from date of award.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:<br />Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required services should submit documentation of their ability to meet the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.  Contractors should also provide their Company Name, DUNS number, Physical Address, and Point of Contact Information.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are required to identify their type of business, applicable North American Industry Classification System Code, and size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non-responsive. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Paul Marsalese, Contract Specialist, at Paul.Marsalese@nih.gov in MS Word format within 7 calendar days of the date of this announcement. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>
<p>Note:<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in the response. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After review of the responses received, pre-solicitation and solicitation notices may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation. The solicitation release date is pending. The Government intends to negotiate a fixed-price contract.</p>

<CONTACT>Kathleen J. Pottkotter, Contracting Officer, Phone 2143124364, Email pottkotterk@aafes.com
<DESC><p>This letter is a Request for Information (RFI/RFQ). The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (Exchange) is seeking information from industry for a replacement of the RSA 2-Factor authentication Solution.</p>
<p>The Exchange is a joint military activity providing quality merchandise and services to active duty military personnel, guard and reserve members, retired military, and their families at competitively low prices. The Exchange is a retail organization with annual sales of $10.3 billion dollars, including $1.6 billion in "concessionaire" sales. Traditionally in the commercial real estate industry the term "concessionaire" refers to "mall tenant". Our services include retail, food, eCommerce, catalogs, and health care services worldwide.</p>
<p>The Exchange is responsible for more than 3,700 facilities worldwide in more than 30 countries, 50 states and five U.S territories. The Exchange operates 157 main stores, 182 Military Clothing facilities, over 1,000 specialty stores (gas stations, bookstores, etc.) and more than 120 theaters. Plus the Exchange has more than 2,100 fast food restaurants, such as Taco Bell, Burger King and Subway. Concession operations overseen by the Exchange add nearly 6,000 more activities.</p>
<p>The intent of this RFI is to gather information about potential vendors and each company's ability to meet the desired requirements outlined below. Before an RFP is produced, we may decide to conduct several demonstrations on an "Industry Day". The Exchange may use the information gathered to further evaluate and/or refine our requirement for a future multiple source solicitation.</p>
<p>What do we want you to submit? The following may be used to further evaluate and/or refine our requirement. If you are interested in this potential upcoming procurement, you must provide:</p>
<p>1. A general overview of your company's products, services and capabilities. <br />2. A brief overview on your company's history, size, market share, growth, core competencies, and major corporate milestones. <br />3. Please provide a brief summary of your company including:<br />a. How long you have been in business and providing this technology/product/services.<br />b. A white paper describing your technology/product/services.<br />c. List of major customers using this technology/product/service and how long they have been using it.<br />d. Typical implementation plan and timeline.<br />4. Responses to the desired requirements and how you meet these.<br />a. Please address each topic listed in the below; explaining how your available products and/or services can provide a solution that will meet our requirements. <br />To assist us in our response analysis, comparisons, and further clarification, please use the same numbering scheme in your responses. <br />b. You may provide additional questions, comments, suggestions or recommendations concerning this request to assist our further consideration and planning. <br />5. If the Exchange should issue a Request For Proposal on this effort, would your company<br />be interested in receiving it? If so, please provide contact information for your company.</p>
<p>Please feel free to add any additional information that the Exchange needs to consider for a solution. Your responses may be used to further evaluate and/or refine our requirements.</p>
<p>Again, this is a Request for Information and a Rough order of Magnitude (ROM) request. The Exchange is not seeking a firm price quote. However, the Exchange does want to understand how the industry prices these solutions. Please provide your standard list pricing information with your response.</p>
<p>AAFES is looking to replace RSA 2-Factor authentication on the following platforms for approximately 10,000 users.</p>
<p>&bull; Citrix<br />&bull; Cisco VPN<br />&bull; Windows Servers<br />&bull; TS Gateway<br />&bull; Linux/Apache<br />&bull; AIX</p>
<p>1. We are interested in leveraging a mixture of hardware tokens, soft tokens and on-demand tokens. <br />2. We require a turn-key solution for end-user self-service.<br />3. Seamless integration is preferred. <br />4. There is one product we have reviewed with DUO Security-they have a two (2) factor authentication tool.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are required by 2:00 PM on Friday, April 10, 2015 via email to pottkotterk@aafes.com. The solicitation will be issued only to those companies that respond to this request.&nbsp; You may also access our solicitations portal and find this RFI to respond to as well: <a href="http://partners.aafes.com/aafessolicitations/default.aspx?WebID=http://arthur.aafes.com/sites/12/15">http://partners.aafes.com/aafessolicitations/default.aspx?WebID=http://arthur.aafes.com/sites/12/15</a></p>

<SUBJECT>National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect
<SOLNBR>150257
<RESPDATE>041715
<CONTACT>Peter D. Preston, Phone 3014435100, Email Peter.Preston@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background:</strong></span> <br /><br />Since 1988, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect and now the Children's Bureau, has funded the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN) through a cooperative agreement. Since its inception, NDACAN has resided at Cornell University, and is now found within Cornell's College of Human Ecology, in the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research (http://www.ndacan.cornell.edu).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NDACAN is a centralized facility for the acquisition, preservation, and dissemination of machine-readable data sets relevant to the study of child maltreatment and child welfare. In 1993, the Panel on Research on Child Abuse and Neglect of the National Research Council identified this data archive as a key component of a strong research structure in its book, Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect<br />(http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309048893).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NDACAN currently holds nearly 200 data sets. Their holdings include, but are not limited to, all of the major datasets reported to the Children's Bureau, such as:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS): collects case-level <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information from state <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tribal title IV-E agencies on all children in foster care and those who have been adopted with title&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV-E agency&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involvement. Title IV-E agencies are required to submit AFCARS data twice a year.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS): is a voluntary data collection system <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that gathers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico about reports of child abuse <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and neglect.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD): collects information about youth in foster care, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including outcomes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for those who have aged out of foster care.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Discretionary grants for research and program development often produce datasets that may be of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interest for&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondary analysis.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; In addition to the data sources that are funded and facilitated by the Children's Bureau, there are&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other very&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important datasets housed at NDACAN, such as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o National Incidence Study (NIS)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o National Study of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW)<br /><br />NDACAN promotes a community of sharing knowledge, by operating a listserv to disseminate information related to child maltreatment and serve as a forum to connect the research community on this issue. They also hold an annual research institute, where a select group of researchers are invited to participate in a four-day onsite institute, to gain hands-on access to data, statistical consultants, and dive deep into analysis with the support of a team to help them with their questions. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Purpose and Objectives: <br /></strong></span><br />A core mission of the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) is to prevent child abuse and neglect and ensure that children who are victims receive treatment and care. Data collection and analysis, and the research knowledge that results, is integral to making important policy decisions, raising awareness, and effecting change. There are many datasets related to child abuse and neglect; some are large, national in scope, and legislatively mandated; other data collection efforts are on a smaller scale through discretionary grants or privately funded research evaluation projects. The National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN) serves as a central repository for these datasets and makes them available for secondary analysis to researchers throughout the country. Providing analytic support, connecting the child maltreatment research community and providing a critical point of access to micro-level data for analysis is a critical function that fosters the continued growth of research-based knowledge on the incidence, causes, consequences, and prevention of child maltreatment, and other child welfare-related topics. The ultimate goal is to promote the expansion of a knowledge base leading to greater safety, permanency, and well-being for America's children. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong></span><br />The purpose of this requirement is to continue the operation of the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN) and to continue the processing, housing, and dissemination of high quality data sets, and related activities to increase the knowledge base in the child welfare field. Specific activities to be undertaken include: maintaining and expanding the existing archive of data sets; promoting the use of the data sets among researchers through a variety of training, technical assistance, dissemination and marketing activities; maintaining and updating a digital library of research publications using datasets in the archive; conducting ad hoc analyses of selected data sets within the archive for Children's' Bureau and ACYF Office of the Commissioner staff, and other requestors; and the continued operation of a listserv of child welfare researchers around the country to promote the exchange of ideas and information that will help the field to move forward. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /></strong></span><br />The anticipated period of performance&nbsp;shall be awarded for a 12 month period from September 30, 2015, with four consecutive 12-month Option periods.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for Dredging of Acushnet River and New Bedford Harbor, New Bedford, Massachusetts.  This announcement is to determine interest, availability and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and other Small Business concerns.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990 with a project estimated construction cost  is between $20 to $30 million.  Work will begin in February 2016 and will extend over a two year period. <br>    <br> The Solicitation is not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District has a future requirement for dredging of New Bedford harbor Superfund Site lower harbor.  Work consist of providing materials, equipment, and labor for environmental dredging of approximately 200,000 cubic yards (CY) of material and depositing it in the Lower Harbor Confined Aquatic  <br> Disposal Cell (LHCC).  Offerors should note that this is not production dredging.  The selected contractor will need to meet precise dredge depths.  Dredging, placement of material into scows, transport of the material, and depositing of material into the LHCC must be performed with minimal spillage or turbidity.  Measures will be required to minimize disturbance of sediments and turbidity.  The LHCC is located between the Route 195 and Route 6 bridges.   The offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide suitable equipment that can dredge at a depth of up to 30 feet of water and shallow draft equipment capable of dredging in 3 feet of water.  The work requires compliance under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 including a Health and Safety Program, Site Specific Health and Safety Plan, and Training (40 Hour HAZWOPER and 8 Hour Refresher Training) for all onsite workers.  The offeror must indicate whether they own, plan to rent or identify their teaming partners who owns the necessary equipment.   <br>  <br> The excavation of the CAD cell will be conducted under a separate contract issued by the New Bedford Harbor Development Commission (HDC).  Sediments placed into the LHCC will be dredged using mechanical dredging equipment.  Debris removal will be required prior to dredging and may include discarded metal objects, timber, abandoned piers.  Access to the upper harbor dredge area is restricted by two low bridges. Shallow draft split hull scows are required to perform this dredging.  All dredged material shall be removed with an environmental (closed) bucket.  Dredging is limited to the upper 2-4 feet.  The dredging process will be operated in a careful, well-designed manner so that the project-specific turbidity criterion of 100 neptholometric turbidity units (ntu) above background measured 300 feet down-current of the dredge area is not exceeded.  The dredged sediments will be placed into split-hull scows for transport to the LHCC. The dredged sediment will not be mechanically dewatered prior to placement, although some passive dewatering will occur during material handling and transport. Free-standing water collected in the scows/hoppers shall be decanted and filtered using activated carbon to ensure compliance with this same 100 ntu turbidity criterion.  A silt curtain and oil boom will be placed around the perimeter of the LHCC. Best management practices, including water and air quality monitoring, will occur during the mechanical dredging, transportation and placement processes to ensure that no exceedances of project performance standards occur and that the placed sediments stay within the LHCC.    <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, small business, etc.), a proof of bonding as well as detailed list of the equipment that would be utilized for this project.  The detailed equipment list should include at a minimum: the name (or names) of the anticipated dredge(s) to be used; a detailed project description of environmental mechanical dredging and complexity performed in the last five(5) years.  Firms must submit documented information that demonstrates experience with a minimum of two examples of a dredging project, similar in scope and magnitude to this project that the firm has performed in the last five years.  Please indicate the team subcontractor(s) (if any), including their prior experience and qualifications, which will be used to support the offeror's effort.  Subcontractor's experience must also have been performed within the last five (5) years.  Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due by April 22, 2015.

(ASA-CSSA-SSSA). NAL requires electronic access via the internet for use by all USDA employees, authorized public on-site users, cooperators, and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA during the period of performance. Access must include perpetual data rights to the content.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or source will meet agency needs. The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences. In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources. USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of this journal content by their heavy past use of the electronic versions of the journals, made accessible by NAL's DigiTop service. NAL would like to continue to benefit from them.</p>
<p>The American Society of Agronomy is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for journal access with perpetual access to the content issued during the period of performance. The American Society of Agronomy is the only copyright holder of its publications and thus is the only source of the access NAL seeks. Having perpetual access rights granted by American Society of Agronomy will give USDA users access in perpetuity to the electronic journals for which NAL purchases access. There is no source but the American Society of Agronomy for the electronic content of the subscribed publications with perpetual access rights.</p>

<DESC>1.0  GENERAL INFORMATION <br>  <br> INTRODUCTION: <br> The U.S. Army's experience in desert operations have exposed military engines to excessive amounts of ingested sand demonstrating that a substantial improvement is still needed in sand tolerant engine technologies on helicopter engines.  Sand ingestion causes severe performance degradation, excessive wear, increased maintenance and eventually premature removal of the engines.  In order to extend the life of helicopter engines in severe sand environments, new and improved engine particle filtration systems must be explored.  Current Inlet Particle Separator (IPS) technology is capable of removing large sand particles (0-1000 micron) relatively effectively, but experiences a dramatic reduction in sand removal efficiency as particle sizes decrease (0-80 micron).  The entire fleet of military helicopters in the Southwest Asia conflicts experienced fine sand ingestion, which compromised engine performance and significantly reduced the operating life of the engines.  Extremely fine sand particles less than 10 microns in diameter (prevalent in the Middle East) are able to bypass the particle separators and enter the cooling circuits and hot section components.  The sand reacts in the hot combustion gases and deposits onto the high pressure turbine (HPT) vanes and blades as CaSO4, glass, and various crystalline silicates.  Deposits up to 0.25 in. thick have been collected on vanes. This causes significant flow reductions and losses in the HPT leading to premature removal of engines due to low performance.  Although cooling hole plugging is a considerable problem, excessive corrosion is not commonly observed due to the high melting point of CaSO4.  Calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) attack on the combustor liners and HPT blades and vanes can also occur leading to spalling of the thermal barrier coatings and premature oxidation of the surfaces. Other designs (passive barrier systems, electrostatic precipitators, etc.) have not been able to achieve desired levels of protection without sacrificing required engine performance/weight or hampering operations.  <br>  <br> Therefore, the objective of this BAA is to explore high separation efficiency, adaptable, engine filtration system concepts and approaches by way of component level design, fabrication and test validation to provide significant durability and performance benefits to enable current and future turboshaft engines to meet the emerging war fighter needs while operating in sand environments.  Offeror must substantiate ability to achieve the sand separation efficiency goals to effectively improve engine Time-On-Wing (TOW), Maintenance & Life Cycle Costs and Mission Fuel Burn.  This effort will demonstrate the proposed smart, adaptive engine filtration capability to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4/5 for future vertical lift aircraft for improved system level performance, durability, and TOW.  TRL 4 is defined as completing component validation in a laboratory environment (bench testing), while TRL 5 is defined as completing component validation in a simulated relevant environment (rig testing). <br>  <br> 2.0  RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:   <br> Call W911W6-15-R-0010 solicits proposals for the development of a Smart Adaptable Efficient Filtration System (SAEFS) under the Engines & Drive Trains Research Opportunity of the Master Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W911W6-15-R-0004 which is posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov and Grants.gov at http://www.grants.gov.   The proposed SAEFS shall be designed to detect when the aircraft is in and out of a sand environment and be able to adapt for durability and/or performance/operability.  The system shall improve current levels of coarse and fine sand particle separation efficiency for improved engine performance retention and durability. <br>  <br> TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  It is the Government's desire to conduct a technology development effort for a SAEFS program to improve turboshaft engine performance retention and durability in sand environments.  The purpose of the SAEFS program is to develop advanced engine filtration technologies in order to operate more effectively in sand environments.  The SAEFS program will only address aerodynamic/inertial particle filtration/separation technologies throughout the engine (not barrier filters, or non-filtration technologies such as erosion coatings).    If the offeror's proposed solution involves integration (physical or other) with aircraft systems to achieve program goals, the proposal needs to clearly identify how these integration requirements limit the applicability of the proposed technology to current and future Army platform systems.  <br>  <br> Goals: <br> 1.  SAEFS that can detect when aircraft is in and out of sand environment and adapt for optimal durability and/or performance/operability. <br> 2.  Sand separation efficiencies: Coarse greater than or equal to 98%, Fine (0-80 micron)greater than or equal to 90% (See Attachment 1 for Sand Constituents and Particle Size Distributions). <br> 3.  Pressure drop to the main engine airflow less than or equal to 1%. <br> * This parameter may be traded to obtain an optimal filtration system solution; however, a pressure drop of 2% or greater is not acceptable. <br>  <br> The SAEFS technology developed in this program will be applicable to current fielded U.S. Army engines (e.g. T55, T700, and  T703) and to future turboshaft engines.  The offeror shall design, fabricate, and perform validation testing of the proposed SAEFS technology.  The SAEFS technology should be demonstrated in the 5-30 lb/sec airflow size range that is of interest to the Army.  The design effort should be based on validated analytical codes to the maximum extent possible.  The SAEFS system will be sufficiently rig tested to ensure separation efficiency levels, pressure losses, mass flow rates, and smart adaptive capabilities have been properly demonstrated.  The scavenge system(s) will be fabricated from material that is durable enough to survive the rig test. <br>  <br> 3.0  ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEVELS: <br>  <br> 3.1  ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE:  <br> Staggered awards are possible starting in 4th quarter FY15, subject to the availability of funds. <br>  <br> 3.2  ANTICIPATED FUNDING FOR PROGRAM:   <br> Available Government funding is approximately $1.4M for all awards.  Government fiscal year distribution is as follows: FY15 $300k, FY16 $200k, FY17 $500k, FY18$400k.  Proposals that are significantly out of alignment with anticipated funding profile may risk not being selected.  To adequately invest in and maximize the breadth of technology developed, there is a potential to make multiple awards for differing SAEFS designs, however the total number of awards is unknown at this time.  Any awards made under this announcement may be incrementally funded and are subject to the availability of funds. <br>  <br> 3.3  TYPE OF CONTRACT/INSTRUMENT:   <br> The Government prefers offerors propose a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA).  This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used.  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, such as Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) type contracts.  The entity submitting the successful proposal(s) must satisfy statutory and regulatory requirements for the Government.  (Refer to the Master BAA for more information)  <br>   <br> 3.4  NUMBER OF AWARDS ANTICIPATED:   <br> No deviation from Master BAA.   <br>  <br> 3.5  ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: <br> Thirty-nine (39) months total (36 technical and 3 for data/final report) <br>  <br> 3.6  BAA FULFILLMENT REQUIREMENTS: <br> No deviation from Master BAA.   <br>  <br> 3.7  DELIVERABLES: <br> All agreements will require delivery of the following items delivered in Contractor's format: (1) Program Plan (delivered 45 days after contract award), (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Test Plans, (4) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (5) *Final Report (which includes Photographic and Video documentation of tests), and (6) Final Briefing at Ft.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to exercise an option year on the existing contract on a sole source basis to Twin Landfill, 1049 Crawford Ave., Steamboat Springs, CO, for the Leadville Sludge Management contract at the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Water Treatment Plant, Colorado. The proposed contract action will extend Contract R14PX00389 by one year under the provisions of statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 52.217-09, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. The estimated dollar value of this extension is approximately $107,215.25 for the period of performance of June 1, 2015 - May 31, 2016.
<p>The Government's intent is to extend the current services with Twin Landfill in order to continue performance of the required services for the first Option Year and the following three (3) Option Year periods. Award to any other source at this time would negatively impact Twin Landfill's ability to perform its mission. It would be impossible for any other contractor to perform all of the highly specialized services required for the Leadville Sludge Management functions without causing an unacceptable delay in the performance of the mission and incurring an additional cost burden.</p>
<p>Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to: adawson@usbr.gov, no later than April 10, 2015 at 10 a.m. MDT. Comments submitted for consideration of other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
Part I ? Background
1.	Date: April 2, 2015
2.	Program Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSEWR), Office of Emergency Management (OEM)
3.	COR: Ms. Portia Perry, (202)-564-2285 Lead Contract Officer?s Representative
4.	Contract No. EP-W-08-036, Mission Support Contract for Regulation, Evaluation and Technical Support
5.	Description of supplies or services required:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Emergency Management (OEM) has a requirement for Regulation, Evaluation and Technical Support performed by the contractor Systems Research Applications (SRA) International, Inc. The mission is to continue technical, evaluation, and regulatory development services to support EPA in developing and implementing prevention programs to reduce the risk of oil and hazardous substances to the environment and build preparedness capacity for responding to emergency events.
6.	Period of Performance: May 5, 2015 ? August 4, 2015
7.	Estimated Contract Amount: The purpose of this justification is to extend the period of performance of Award Term I under the current contract by three (3) months. This extension will not result in an increase in the contract ceilings for cost, fee and labor hours. The existing contract ceiling amounts for Award Term I in the amount of $8,285,026.50 for cost, $653,968.50 for fixed fee and 91,200 for labor hours remain unchanged. Upon expiration of Award Term I under the current contract on May 4, 2015, sufficient funds shall be obligated on the contract to ensure that there is no lapse in service under this mission critical contract. 
8.	Proposed Contractor:  Systems Research Applications (SRA) International, Inc. 4300 Fair Lakes Court Fairfax, VA 22033-4232


Part II ? Justification
Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) prompts other than full and open competition. 
1) Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/Office of Acquisition Management (OAM)/Office of Emergency Management
2) Nature and /or description of the action being approved. 
This action is to extend the existing contract for three months with Systems Research Applications (SRA) International, Inc. The EPA proposes to negotiate a 3-month contract extension on the basis of other than full and open competition. OEM has a requirement to continue technical, evaluation, and regulatory development services to support EPA in developing and implementing prevention programs to reduce the risk of oil and hazardous substances to the environment and build preparedness capacity for responding to emergency events. Those services include support to OEM in planning, implementing and evaluating the Agency?s chemical emergency preparedness, prevention, community right-to-know programs, and the Agency?s participation in national disaster and emergency preparedness and response programs, including counter-terrorism. This extension is necessary as the follow on, full and open competitive requirement is still in the proposal evaluation phase. This extension will ensure performance of critical services only until the re-competition process is completed.
The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that the only way to ensure these critical services go uninterrupted is to obtain support for these services with Systems Research Applications (SRA) International, Inc. This contractor is the only responsible contractor that can fulfill this requirement at this time because of the  program office?s ongoing need for preparedness in the event of an emergency situation for which SRA currently plays an integral part. It would be more advantageous and cost effective to the Government to obtain services from SRA instead of the additional time and costs associated with locating another contractor who can perform work already in progress, in addition to the costs necessary to transition current, ongoing work to a new contractor.
Proposed Contractor: Systems Research Applications (SRA) International, Inc. 4300 Fair Lakes Court Fairfax, VA 22033-4232

The estimated period of the three-month extension is from May 5, 2015 through August 4, 2015. 
The existing services are currently being performed by SRA under Contract No. EP-W-08-036. This contract was competed and awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15 procedures. Request for Proposals No. PR-HQ-08-10150 was synopsized and solicitation posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on October 26, 2007, and closed on January 29, 2008. Contract No. EP-W-08-036 was competitively awarded to Systems Research Applications (SRA) International, Inc. on May 2, 2008 and expires on May 4, 2015.
3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs (including the estimated value).
The critical mission of the support contract, provided by SRA, is to support OEM in its mission to reduce the risk of oil and hazardous substances to the environment and build preparedness capacity for responding to emergency events by leveraging management contract vehicles to achieve economies of scale while providing quality and timely services. 
SRA shall continue to support critical tasks currently being performed under EPA contract number EP-W-08-036, via work assignments. This extension combines those critical tasks and requires continued performance by SRA until the follow on contract is awarded. Furthermore, this extension does not allow for new work nor does it require performance of work that is not critical. The task areas under which SRA will continue performance are: ?	Analytical Support. The contractor shall provide analytical support and obtain the necessary background information. The contractor shall provide assistance to EPA in preparing a variety of studies, regulations, technical analyses, compilations, general or technical guidance documents, other technical products and activities. ?	Technical Assistance. The contractor shall provide technical assistance to EPA for a variety of projects and activities pursuant to OEM responsibilities in planning, implementing, and evaluating Agency responses. ?	Conference/Meeting Support. The contractor shall provide logistical support for meetings, conferences, and workshops for all OEM activities under the SOW. The contractor shall facilitate national meetings related to OEM programs. ?	Training Support. The contractor shall provide technical support for training and technical workshops for instruction and orientation in various aspects of OEM programs. ?	Communications and Outreach Support. The contractor shall provide technical support for outreach activities which explain all OEM program activities. ?	Program Evaluation Support. The contractor shall provide support to EPA for a variety of evaluative tasks concerning its programs. ?	Management Systems and Planning Support. The contractor shall provide support in a variety of planning aspects and administrative options.
4) An identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition
In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), and FAR Subpart 6.302-1, it is determined that SRA is the only responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements at this time. A delay in extending this contract in order to complete the re-competition of services provided by the contract would place EPA at significant risk. The EPA currently does not possess the resources, financial or otherwise, to award a separate ?bridge contract? for technical, evaluation, and regulatory development services by May 4th 2015. It would take significant time and additional costs for another contractor to transition and assume the duties that SRA is currently performing. An example which highlights this fact is the inclusion of a 30-day transition plan as a matter of responsibility in the event that an offeror, other than the incumbent, receives the new award. Furthermore, there is no other EPA or Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC)  available that provide the same or similar services that would satisfy the requirements under the current contract. 
The work performed under this contract provides critical services to the agency, and continuity of services is imperative at this time. A lapse in these critical services prior to the award of a new mission support contract would impact the EPA?s project timelines for overseeing the prevention programs to reduce the risk of oil and hazardous substances to the environment and build preparedness capacity for responding to emergency events and subject EPA to significant risks.
5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
According to the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), SRA has provided ?very good? to ?exceptional? service under this contract for over six years and possesses the institutional knowledge to provide uninterrupted and seamless support to OEM until the follow-on competitive award is in place. SRA has developed its capabilities during the course of performing under the current contract. Even under the best conditions, no other firm could acquire the knowledge and experience necessary to provide continued and timely services to support EPA in developing and implementing prevention programs (i.e., to reduce the risk of oil and hazardous substances to the environment and build preparedness capacity for responding to emergency events).
The Pre-Solicitation Notice for SOL-HQ-15-00002 was posted on FedBizOpps on January 23, 2015. It is anticipated that the full solicitation for OEM?s Regulation, Evaluation, and Technical Support will be posted by the end of April 2015.  6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.   Upon approval, the Contracting Officer will post this justification as a special notice to FedBizOpps and FedConnect for 30 days to inform the general public and provide an opportunity for any interested parties to respond to the notice and actions therein. Any communications received in response to the notice will be reasonably considered. Furthermore, a solicitation for the re-acquisition of these services is currently in progress and OAM has conducted extensive outreach activities with industry by posting a pre-solicitation notice to promote and receive competition from additional sources.
7) A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.
At time of award, the labor rates and anticipated cost to the Government under the current contract EP-W-08-036 were determined to be fair and reasonable. The extension under the contract from May 5, 2015 through August 4, 2015 will incorporate the labor rates and escalation rate under the original contract for Award Term I. 			 8) A description of the market research.
Extensive market research was conducted during the pre-award phase of the current contract. The Contracting Officer conducted market research to the extent that it researched in-house EPA contracts as well as other GWACs in search of sources that could readily perform the same or similar services that would satisfy the requirements under the current contract. Consequently, the Contracting Officer made the determination that there are no other EPA or GWACs that can readily satisfy the requirements under the current contract without benefit of a transition phase with the current contractor, which could result in untimely delays and quite possibly inferior performance, coupled with additional costs to the Government. 
9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
Without the mission support contract services OEM would be unable to meet its responsibility of implementing preparedness, planning, prevention, response, and community right-to-know activities. 
SRA is the only responsible contractor with the corporate knowledge and critical information required to continue EPA?s efforts for the next three months in a timely, uninterrupted manner until the follow-on contract is awarded. A full and open competition to complete the remaining performance would cause unnecessary delay and additional costs. 
No barriers to future competition exist, as the 5-year follow-on contract is being competed using full and open competition. 
10) A listing of sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition.
Based upon the rationale as contained in paragraphs 1 through 9 above, no other sources will be solicited for the period of the extension. 
11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for supplies or services required.
The Government will seek competition of future acquisitions for these services, thus eliminating the barriers to competition. &#8195;

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> HQ, Army Materiel Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> Ft.

<p>&nbsp;BASIS FOR AWARD: The NLRB intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The objective of the NLRB is to select the offer that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the requirements. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of Proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit Proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit a Proposal which shall be considered by the NLRB. All Proposals must confirm in their offer that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in Proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management database (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p>1. Technical: <br />a. Proposals will be evaluated for ability to provide all contract requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />b. Lodging Rooms: Size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/Wi-Fi connections) will be taken into consideration.<br />c. Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session meeting room location as related to the office space; the atmosphere of the general session room (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking; cash bar; and menu selections and A/V equipment will be taken into consideration.<br />d. Location: The hotel will be either in the downtown San Diego, CA, downtown Atlanta, GA, or downtown Denver, CO area. The hotel should be within easy walking distance of a variety of restaurants, commuting ease from Airport, and must be located in a safe neighborhood.</p>
<p>Ratings:<br />Adjective/Definition<br />Exceptional: Exceeds most of the required performance outcomes or capabilities in ways beneficial to the agency and has no significant weakness.<br />Good: Exceeds a few of the required performance outcomes or capabilities in a beneficial way to the agency and has no significant weakness.<br />Acceptable: Meets required performance outcomes or capabilities and any weaknesses are readily correctable.<br />Marginal: Fails to meet required performance outcomes or capabilities; however, any significant weaknesses or deficiencies are correctable.<br />Unacceptable: Fails to meet a performance outcome or capability requirement of the RFP and the deficiency is uncorrectable without a major revision of the proposal.</p>
<p><br />2. Past Performance - <br />a. Quality of product/service<br />b. Responsiveness of key personnel and staff<br />c. Overall Satisfaction</p>
<p>**Past Performance will be assessed by utilizing the attached questionnaire. The Offeror is requested to provide at least three references or may have the references complete the questionnaire and submit to the Contracting Officer on or before the proposal due date. The reference information should be project/action specific. The reference information cannot be more than five years old. The NLRB may also assess Past Performance in any other manner prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>Ratings:<br />Adjective/Definition<br />Exceptional: Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good: Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory: Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.<br />Marginal: Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions.<br />Unsatisfactory: Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.</p>
<p>3. Proposed Total Price should be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. Pricing should be provided for the following contract line items (CLIN):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 Hotel Lodging for six (6) days and five (5) nights in accordance with the Solicitation.<br /><br />CLIN 002 Meeting Space Rental to include one office; one (1) general session room for 120-130 people; ten (10) breakout rooms for 15 people; and one (1) room for award ceremony for 120-130 people as described above. Provide a table in a similar format as below:</p>
<p>Room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimensions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set-Up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room/Space Name<br />Office:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Registration Area:<br />General Session<br />Room:<br />Break Out Room #1:<br />Breakout Room #2:<br />Breakout Room #3:<br />Breakout Room #4:<br />Breakout Room #5:<br />Breakout Room #6:<br />Breakout Room #7:<br />Breakout Room #8:<br />Breakout Room #9:<br />Breakout Room #10:<br />Awards Ceremony:</p>
<p>CLIN 003 Food and Beverages - light refreshments in accordance with the Solicitation, an Awards Ceremony with Hor d'oeurves and cash bar on Day Two in accordance with the Solicitation.</p>
<p>CLIN 004 Audio Visual/Flipchart services and equipment in accordance with the Solicitation.</p>
<p>CLIN 005 Miscellaneous Expenses (e.g., extra AV equipment, copying of papers, additional meeting room space, etc.)</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as Proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate Proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government. <br />In case of a receipt of a large number of Proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate Proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of Proposals being considered for contract award. <br />First, technical Proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those Proposals that are unacceptable in not meeting the aforementioned criteria. <br />The decision to eliminate any offers does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit Proposal revisions.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:</p>
<p>Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow this format or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>A hotel contract shall be submitted with your technical and price Proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams, and square footage and menus. Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit a separate technical and cost Proposal that addresses the Statement of Work. Proposals are due by 3:00 p.m. EDT on April 17, 2015 via email to Delfina St Clair at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov or by regular mail.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78. This requirement is 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561330 with a Small Business size standard of $27.5 million dollars. The Wisconsin Army National Guard Contracting Office, has a requirement for 3 Case Managers (see PWS) and 5 Administrative Care Coordinators (See PWS).  This award will have a period of performance of one calendar year 1 June 2015 - 31 May 2016.  <br>  <br> BID SCHEDULE: Please price for the entire P.O.P.

Please review the attached Performance Work Statement.  <br>  <br> Offers received will be evaluated based on FAR Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. The clause will be incorporated into the solicitation and shall read as follows:  <br>  <br> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Offerors are reminded that the evaluation process is subjective despite the use of factors as outlined below. Past Performance and Management Capability when combined are equal to Price. <br>  <br> 1. Past Performance- To demonstrate satisfactory past performance the Offeror shall provide documentation of satisfactory performance on past or current contracts of a similar type, size, scope and complexity, performed within the last three (3) years including references, with names and contact information of the references who can verify such past performance. Past performance information of key personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the Offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available. Neutral past performance is not negatively scored but may have a negative impact in the overall consideration for award. The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The Offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the Offeror. Limit Past Performance documentation to four pages. <br>  <br> 2. Management Capability - Management Capability is defined as the documented capability to meet the minimum requirements of the requirement as specified in this solicitation and the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Offeror's proposal should clearly outline the Offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the performance work statement. Limit Management Capability documentation to 4 pages.  <br>  <br> 3. Price - All quotes submitted will be evaluated for Management Capability, Past Performance, and Price. The Government will issue an award to the Offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government but not necessarily the lowest price. If all things are equal, the Offer which is most advantageous to the Government may also be the lowest price determined to be reasonable IAW FAR 12.209. Offeror's are encouraged to propose their best price. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposed by adding the total price for all Line Items. The resulting contract from this solicitation will be a firm fixed price contract.  <br>  <br> It is not the intent of the Government to enter into negotiations. It is incumbent upon the Offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine satisfactory Past Performance, Management Capability, and Price reasonableness. Failure to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine Management Capability, Past Performance or Price may result in the rejection of your proposal. An award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price (IAW 52.212-2(b)), of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  <br> Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR):  The contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for either ARMY collection site.

<p>The diode laser bars produce 100 watt of optical power at a vacuum wavelength of 795.0 nm at a cooling temperature of 15 degree Celsius. These lasers shall have only one diode array per bar, "smile" less than 2 microns and a fast axis-collimating lens attached. The laser diode bar has to operate in the CW mode, with a spectral linewidth of 2 nm. The combination of a 100 Watt laser with only one diode array per bar and operation at the uncommon wavelength of 797.5 nm +/- 2 nm make this a product that is only available from established companies that are willing to take on the production for a custom research laser.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Requirements:<br /></strong>Contractor shall provide diode laser bars with the following specification:</p>
<p>&bull; Wavelength: 797.5 nm +/- 2 nm at 25 degree C water<br />&bull; Power: minimum of 100 W<br />&bull; Linewidth: 2 nm <br />&bull; "Smile": &lt; 2 microns <br />&bull; Fast collimating lens: yes <br />&bull; Number of diode arrays per bar: only 1 <br />&bull; Plastic water manifold: NO <br />&bull; Running mode: continuous<br />&bull; Expected lifetime: 5000 h</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide six (6) plastic water manifolds used to cool the laser diode bar efficiently. The plastic water manifold has to match with the laser diode bar specified above.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery:</strong><br />Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be delivered no later than eight (8) weeks after receipt of award.</p>
<p><strong>1352.246-70 Place of Acceptance:</strong><br />(a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be: 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD. 20899</p>
<p><strong>Final Acceptance: <br /></strong>Contractor shall provide test results for each diode laser bar, at minimum, central wavelength, spectral linewidth, measurements of optical power and corresponding voltage and current. Government will inspect and measure each diode laser bar to see if they meet the specification stated below and check the provided test results. Government will inspect and provide written approval within two (2) weeks after receipt of each diode laser bar.</p>

The OCT must have the ability to provide high definition OCT scans of the retina, including the macula, optic nerve, and retinal nerve fiber layer. Fundus image and data density must provide clinically relevant views of the retina. <br>  <br> 2. The device needs to be easy to use and does not require a highly-skilled technician. <br>  <br> 3. The unit must be able to scan customized areas of the retina other than the posterior pole. <br>  <br> 4. The OCT needs to be able to capture entire scan cube no less than 2.4 seconds. <br> 	 <br> 5. The retinal imaging and OCT must have an integrated design (OCT/camera in one). Requires a small footprint to fit in the small available space of the clinic. <br>  <br> 6. The device needs precise registration of OCT scan to fundus image using advanced algorithms. <br>  <br> 7. The OCT is required to have auto centration of RNFL analysis. <br>  <br> 8. Have the capability to process high data density, minimum of 1024 data points captured over a 2mm depth to create a tissue density profile (A-scan), 512 A scans creating a cross sectional image (B-scan). 128 B scans captured to create a cube with over 67 million data points. <br>  <br> 9. Be able to capture data from single macula cube scan providing high resolution cross hair images; 3D layer map of inner limiting membrane (ILM) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE); 3D retinal thickness map; 3D cube imaging; OCT fundus image with overlay of thickness map, OCT fundus. <br>  <br> 10. Provide glaucoma scan of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness map and deviation map with comparison to normative data; TSNIT (Temporal, Superior, Nasal, Inferior, Temporal) graph and both eye analysis. Adjustable five-liner raster scan providing exquisite High Definition B-scan image. <br>  <br> 11. Be able to capture retinal images through a no less than 3.3 mm pupil size. This eliminates dilation of patients. <br>  <br> 12. Have advanced positioning and focusing aid, as well as auto-focus. This reduces user-training time. Auto focus enables a smooth and fast workflow while reducing operating steps resulting in convenience and greater efficiency. <br>  <br> 13. Have auto flash for retinal imaging. Must be able to acquire images with the correct exposure nearly 100% the first time providing the opportunity to acquire more images non-mydriatically (without dilation). <br>  <br> 14. Include a built-in medical scientific sensor which is calibrated for retinal images. <br>  <br> 15. Must have an internal fixation target with various fixation points and free-hand mode. <br>  <br> 16. Must have telecentric optics to neutralize the effects of patients's emmetropia, eliminating the potential for image distortion and delivering repeatable and precise measurements of retinal physiology resulting in true pathological size regardless of focus. <br>  <br> 17. Must have stereo capture mode for fundus stereo photography. <br>  <br> 18. Must have advanced imaging options for fundus autofluorescence and ICG angiography. This encompasses a combination of a non-mydriatic fundus camera with superior image quality and an easy-to-use camera for fluorescein angiography. This makes it practical for the detailed diagnosis and management of typical diseases of the eye, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, for easy and fast monitoring of AMD patients, and for clinicians who want to perform ICGA procedures. <br>  <br> 19. Retinal imaging must have color image separation for the retinal camera. <br>  <br> 20.  Must be FDA approved. <br>  <br> INSTALLATION <br>  <br> 1.

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>The source selection process to be used for this acquisition is the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) process. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible contractor whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical - The Offeror shall describe its approach to accomplishing the requirements of the Statement of Work. The Government shall evaluate the offeror's ability to meet the requirement and conform to the specifications in the solicitation based on vendors technical competence and understanding of the requirements in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings <br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any offeror's technical submission graded unacceptable will not receive further consideration for award.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2: Past Performance: Past performance submissions shall be evaluated for Relevancy. Relevant contracts are similar to the scope and magnitude of the PWS. All past performance submissions that are considered relevant shall be evaluated for quality. Offers shall provide the name, title and phone number of principal for no less than three prior or current contracts/agreements for similar scoped projects performed during the previous three years. Furnish the following information for each contract listed: <br />(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Product/Service<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, fax and telephone number of the contracting officer<br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br /><br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the<br />Government has a reasonable expectation that<br />the offeror will successfully perform the<br />required effort, or the offeror's performance<br />record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the<br />Government has no reasonable expectation that<br />the offeror will be able to successfully perform</p>
<p><br />Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risks rests with the offerors.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom<br />information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past<br />performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or<br />unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be<br />determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,<br />"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price: The Government will evaluate the offeror's cost/price quote in order to assess the realism of the proposed cost/price, determine the probable cost to the Government, and to assist in determining the offeror's understanding of the technical requirements.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />AWARD WILL BE MADE TO THE OFFEROR WITH A TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE PROPOSAL WITH THE LOWEST EVALUATED PRICE.<br />FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract Mar 2000<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 1 day; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 1 day before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises the options, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 1 year.<br />SOFARS 5652.201-9002 Authorized Changes Only By Contracting Officer Jan 2005</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not comply with any order, direction or request of Government personnel unless it is issued in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, or is pursuant to specific authority otherwise included as part of this contract. Except as specified herein, no order, statement, or conduct of Government personnel who visit the contractor's facilities or in any other manner communicates with Contractor personnel during the performance of this contract shall constitute a change under the Changes clause in Section I. In the event the Contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.  <br>  (3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.  <br>  (4) Rates, Charges, and Services.   <br>  (i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-  <br>  (A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;  <br>  (1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and  <br>  (2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;  <br>  (B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS.   <br>  (ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.  <br>  (iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.  <br>  (iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.  <br>  (v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-  <br>  (A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or  <br>  (B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.  <br>  (vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-  <br>  (A) Provide the equipment; or  <br>  (B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.  <br>  (vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute to be resolved IAW FAR 52.233-1, Disputes Clause, which is incorporated by reference in 52.212-4(d).  <br>  (w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services.   <br>  (1) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is  <br>  established by the Government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience).  <br>  (2) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.  <br>  (3) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to - (i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; (ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition.

<DESC>03/23/2015 - Additional Questions asked:
<p>1. Does the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation under solicitation number DESOL0008116 contain requirements similar to a current contract? If possible, please provide the current contract number. Or, is this a new requirement for the government?</p>
<p>This is a new requirement.</p>

<p><span style="COLOR: #1f497d">Most of locations with vertically oriented bolts are free of lead based paint.

<DESC>Solicitation TIRNO-15-Q-NFL001 Fingerprint Specialist Questions:
<p>1) With the understanding that it is on an "as needed" basis and may not be equally distributed, is the total number of hours (2,080) to be split between two examiners? Or will each examiner be budgeted for up to 2,080 hours? I believe the 2,080 hours was intended to be per examiner, but this would depend on how much the contractor is charging.</p>
<p><br />2) Can more than two examiners be used to perform the required services? That is, assuming that the same level of expertise were provided, could more than two examiners be used to perform the work over the course of the contract? We would prefer just two examiners based on the fact that this is intended to be a one year contract. Because of the learning curve (i.e. they have to learn our policies, procedures and systems, we have to establish competency before letting them work cases, they have to have background checks, there would be possible testimony needed after having worked the cases, etc.)</p>
<p>3) Which AFIS technology is currently being used by the IRS to conduct latent searches (3M Cogent, MorphoTrak, NEC, etc.)? We use the NGI AFIS system maintained by the FBI. Because we are a national laboratory, we only use this system and not a State operated system (e.g. 3M Cogent, NEC, etc.).</p>
<p>4) Is there only one location where services are to be performed? If so, assuming a qualified examiner had to travel from out of the area in order to perform the required services, would travel expenses be subject in any way to reimbursement? We would consider letting the services be performed at another; however, the contractor would have to demonstrate they are capable of demonstrating compliance with the accreditation standards related to evidence security, control, handling, etc.</p>
<p><br />5) Reference 2080 hours - the solicitation states "seeking services of two fingerprint specialists" -- are these hours for each specialist or a total for two specialists? It is up to 2,080 hours per specialist; however, it may not be that much. It will depend on what the contractor is charging and when the money runs out.</p>
<p>6) When submitting our bid price is there a format to follow, or an online form we are to complete? No, please provide me with your hourly rate.</p>
<p>7) Synopsis states" contractor shall be utilized on an &lsquo;as needed" basis - would the contractor be allowed to rotate their specialists as needed to provide the services requested? As previously stated, I would prefer we NOT rotate specialists. Rotating specialists could become management intensive and take away from the amount of time that goes into working the cases (i.e. becoming familiar with our operating procedures, competency testing, etc.). However, if the only solicitation we get is the offer to "rotate" specialists, that would not prevent us from entering into the contract.</p>
<p>8) Are there any other fees that we should take into consideration when submitting our bid price (e.g. third party fees)? None, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>9) Are there any specific insurance requirements mandated by the contract? I'm not sure I can answer this. Maybe this is a question for the contracting officer or legal? How has this been handled in other contracts?</p>
<p>10) Are courtroom testimony costs included in the 2080 hours? Yes, while the specialist is under contract. Our examiners will be verifying any identifications made by the contracted specialist, so that when the contract has ended our examiners can testify.</p>
<p>11) What is the minimum number of hours for "as needed" basis? Minimum of 20 hours per week up to 35/40 hours per week, as needed based on case demand.</p>
<p>12) Is travel to be included in pricing, or does the IRS pay all travel related expenses? Again, I'm not sure I can answer this. How has this been handled by other contracts? I would think the potential contractor would have to work that into the price of the contract. Let's say they are including travel time in the 40 hours, then maybe that only gives us 30 hours of casework per week when we're paying for 40 hours to include travel related expenses</p>
<p><br />13) Should a bid divide that 2080 hours between two individuals who will essentially work part-time, when needed? <br />I am looking for your company's hourly rate. 2080 Hours is for one finger print specialist annual costs. The synopsis states "utilized on as needed basis". Workload shall determine actual hours needed.<br />14) Or are they looking for two full-time individuals each to work 2080 hours? <br />Yes, the requirement calls for two specialist, "as needed "which may reach a total of 2080 hours annually.</p>
<p>15) And what is the time period - is this a one year full-time contract or is it a multi-year, part-time contract?<br />This is a one year requirement it will run for 12 months from date of award.<br />16) Does the laboratory management have an anticipated start date for these individuals?<br />Award shall be made based on how many responsible proposals will be submitted by close date of April 7,2015 @12:00pm</p>

<p>Pay band 4A ($39.77 - $56.13 per hour)</p>

<p>Who may be considered U.S. citizens</p>
<p>Duty location Niamey, Niger</p>
<p>Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a United States government-owned corporation created in 2004, whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected developing countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. To receive assistance, eligible countries are required to enter into a public agreement (Compact) with the MCC that includes a multi-year plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives, regular benchmarks to measure progress, multi-year financial plan, and a plan to ensure accountability for the use of MCA assistance.<br />Eligible countries develop, in coordination with the MCC, a program agreement (Compact) that is then implemented during five years. <br /><br />SCOPE OF POSITION<br /><br />The MCC is in the process of developing a compact with the Government of <br />Niger (GoN) and seeks to recruit a U.S. Citizen based in Niamey, Niger, to serve as Personal Service Contract (PSC) Employee to support the MCC Niger Country Team (CT) with (i) Compact Development and Due Diligence, (ii) travel security logistics, and (iii) Contingency Response Support. <br />A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contact:<br />(1) Performance on site. <br />(2) Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government. <br />(3) Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission. <br />(4) Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel. <br />(5) The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year. <br />(6) The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to- <br />(i) Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii) Retain control of the function involved; or <br />(iii) Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee. <br /><br />KEY REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />&bull; U.S. citizenship <br />&bull; Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance<br />&bull; Performance at Niamey, Niger. Relocation expenses will not be paid<br />&bull; Overseas travel may be required (to MCC eligible countries)<br />&bull; Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (i.e. Office of Government Ethics form-450, or similar statement) may be required<br />&bull; Active and approved System for Award Management (SAM) record (listed as sole-proprietor). PLEASE NOTE: This contract shall be awarded solely to an individual(s), not to a firm. The individual must have an active DUNS # and a fully approved and active record in the SAM. The approval of your record in SAM may take a few weeks. Therefore, please register in SAM immediately after submitting your application.<br /><br />DUTIES<br /><br />Major Duties and Responsibilities include:</p>

The contract will have two one-year option periods that may be exercised at the sole discretion MCC. <br />The pay range for this position is $39.77 - $56.13 per hour.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED (SON)<br />DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS) <br />RADAR OPERATIONS CENTER (ROC)<br />SERVICE LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM (SLEP)</p>
<p>PURCHASE REQUEST - NWWG9430-15-01335</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: This technology refresh project replaces the obsolete WSR-88D signal processor suite with the latest processor suite from the same manufacturer. The Receiver/Signal Processor consists of two rack mounted chassis, the Radar Video Processor (RVP) and Radar Control Processor (RCP) and a high speed analog/digital converter Intermediate Frequency Digitizer (IFD). This gathers raw radar return signals and generates data required to process and display weather information. The different components of the Receiver/Signal Processor are either currently obsolete or projected obsolete from an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) support perspective within the next 5 years. Replacing these components and their ancillary parts and components (cables, mountings etc.) will ensure continued ability to maintain the units and deploy security updates. The only cost effective replacement is the latest generation of signal processor manufactured by the OEM of the current unit, Vaisala/SIGMET. The WSR-88D receiver/signal processor is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), high-technology, solid state device. The OEM has announced that the item can no longer be supported after 2015. The Government will no longer have a source for item repair, and the system software will not be upgradeable to address evolving security and performance requirements beyond that date, requiring a technology refresh.</p>
<p>PURPOSE: The WSR-88D receiver/signal processor is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), high-technology, solid state device. Ancillary parts and components are needed to support the signal processor technology refresh, requiring the ROC to procure commercial cables to support the new signal processor configuration.</p>
<p>In an effort to support the continued operation of the signal processing suite refresh and the operation of the WSR-88D, the ROC requires commercial cables to support the new signal processing configuration. Although brand names are specified in the CLINs below, any equivalent cable can be proposed. Selection will be lowest cost, technically acceptable.</p>

<DESC>REQ/SOLICITATION #5202010EQ0004
<p>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION<br />HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION</p>
<p>OGC Legal Training Conference<br />LOCATION WILL BE RICHMOND, VIRGINIA<br />FIRM CONFERENCE DATES ARE MONDAY, JUNE 8, 2015 THROUGH FRIDAY, JUNE 12, 2015</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $32.5 million.</p>
<p><br />A. BACKGROUND<br />SBA intends to procure a facility to host an attorney-wide training event, "Legal Training Event," to be held in downtown Richmond, Virginia from June 08, 2015 - June 12, 2015. The Contractor shall provide all services, space and supplies for meeting, lodging and food to accommodate approximately 140 attendees. Lodging and food service cost shall not exceed the current government per diem rate for the Richmond, Virginia locality. The Contractor shall provide fully furnished training facilities including audio visual and internet support. Additionally, the contractor shall provide on-site parking.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group and some training attendees will arrive on Monday, June 08, 2015 with the majority of the group arriving on Tuesday, June 09, 2015. Attendees will be arriving from the all over the United States and its territories.</p>
<p><br />B. OBJECTIVES<br />OGC attorneys hold positions of great responsibility and they are obligated to adhere to a strict code of ethics. The attorneys act as both advocates and advisors for the SBA and they are critically linked to all program operations. As advocates, the attorneys act on behalf of the SBA, researching and applying written law and representing the Agency in trials. As advisors, they counsel SBA employees about their legal rights and obligations and suggest particular courses of actions in business matters. Therefore, it is critical for the attorneys to keep informed about legal and non-legal developments that affect their practice. This conference will fulfill critical training required for the attorneys to stay abreast of those developments.</p>
<p>The three goals of this conference are:</p>
<p>1. To maintain and sharpen the skills of OGC attorneys so that they remain proficient in their work;</p>
<p>2. To keep up with the latest developments within their particular area of law; and</p>
<p>3. To communicate and train the legal staff on the dramatic changes in many areas of the law that directly impact the Agency.</p>
<p>C. 1. PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />SBA will not consider a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel. This is NOT a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable. The Contractor shall provide lodging, meals, training space and audio/visual (A/V) for the event as identified in the subparts below:</p>
<p><br />1.1 HOTEL AND LODGING REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1.1.1 The hotel shall be within a 15-mile drive of the Richmond International Airport. Downtown Richmond is the preferred location for the venue.</p>

In the alternative, we request that contractor provide a web link, if available, so that guests can make hotel reservations online themselves and allow the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and others on the planning team to check on room pick-up throughout the planning process. The entire event, including lodging, will be contracted and invoiced against a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission, in order to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 80% occupancy rate of its participant's guest room without penalty.</p>

<p>F. EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>1.The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and all other technical factors considered. Technical factors are more important than price in determining Best Value. This acquisition shall be evaluated using the best value method. See Factor 1: Technical Proposal below. Each paragraph listed below holds the same level of importance when evaluating offers.</p>
<p>2. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>3.The Government reserves the right to visit, inspect, preview the venue prior to making a final award selection.</p>
<p>3. FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.<br />Discuss anticipated methodology to meet performance objectives as related to the specific tasks identified in Paragraph C.1, 2.0, 5.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 &amp; D, and subparts, of the PWS. It is highly recommended that each paragraph listed and their subparagraphs be addressed in the technical proposal. Offerors shall also submit documentation and descriptive literature (brochures) and menus which clearly identifies how the offer submitted meets the requirements.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the PWS. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully; each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the PWS. Award will be made to the offeror who best addresses all the needs of the PWS with the highest quality and capabilities. In accordance with FAR 15.304(c)(3)(iii), the contracting officer has determined that past performance is not an appropriate evaluation factor for this acquisition. Offerors shall not provide any past performance in response to the proposal.</p>
<p>4. FACTOR 2: PRICE CRITERIA. <br />Price will not be assigned an adjectival rating or scored; it will be evaluated by the Contracting Officer, to determine whether it is fair and reasonable and if it reflects the offeror's understanding of the work. Guest rooms, meeting space, A/V, parking, shuttle service and meals may be complete meeting package if consistent with usual conference pricing. Therefore, in lieu of breaking out the cost of the conference, offerors may price this requirement as a package. However, in doing so, the offeror represents and certifies that the cost of hotel rooms and meals are within the allowable Federal Travel Regulation per diem rates listed in this PWS for their location. Otherwise, all offers shall be broken down by nightly rates per room, meals, conference facilities, and audio-visual service and support.</p>

<p>Public health emergency events, such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa, can expand exponentially, making a rapid response essential.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) continues to make investments in technologies required to improve response capabilities to public health emergencies.  HHS prepares and responds to natural disasters, infectious diseases including Ebola and pandemic influenza, and Chemical, Biological, Nuclear, and Radiological (CBRN) threats.   The Division of Analytic Decision Support (ADS) within the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) provides real-time epidemiology analysis, analytics, and advanced visualization to support public health emergencies and planning activities.</p>
<p>Specifically, the 2012 Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) Implementation Plan requires BARDA ADS to develop a visualization center to perform real time threat analysis and epidemiology modeling to support senior level PHEMCE decision-making process.  The 2005 National Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan requires the operations of a real-time modeling hub.  The 2006 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), (PL109-417) reaffirmed by the 2013 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (PAHPRA) and the 2004 Project Bioshield contain requirements for analysis and evidence-base decision making within HHS, ASPR, and BARDA.</p>
<p><br />Through these requirements and activities, HHS has identified the need for a visualization capability/environment that will enable developers to engage with officials within an immersive visualization environment to review models, explore scenarios, and conduct "What If?" analysis.  This statement of work identifies the requirements for a new HHS visualization capability.  The visualization environment will be identified as the BARDA Viz Hub, and will be available to HHS and its partners in the HHS Innovation Lab, which currently is in the design phase in a General Services Agency (GSA) managed building in Washington D.C. In concert with the management assignment of The VizHub, the newly initiated HHS Innovation Lab Program is also under the management responsibility of ADS.</p>
<p>In 2013, the ADS began conducting extensive market research including site visits to visualization centers to identify the commercially available systems that meet HHS, ASPR, &amp; BARDA's requirements. From the market research, it was determined that the utilization of an immersive, multi-person 3-dimensional stereographic virtual reality (VR) visualization environment to visualize and augment the results of operational data and modeling products (e.g. medical and public health consequence models and infectious disease forecasts developed by BARDA ADS) from the Modeling and Visualization Hub would fulfill the HHS and PHEMCE requirements for visualization infrastructure.</p>
<p><br /><strong>SCOPE OF WORK/SPECIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>HHS requires a "Visualization Hub" (synonymously "Viz Hub") that is a turnkey solution for immersive 3-dimensional visualization within a virtual reality environment that multiple people can simultaneously stand inside.  In simple terms, the system shall be a metal frame on which multiple 3D stereographic televisions are mounted on the inside, making up a round room with a minimum of 300 degree panoramic viewing.  Each screen would need to be connected to a computer with a video card, which requires mounting on the outside of the frame.  Additional computer peripherals are needed including stereo speakers and motion tracking devices, 3D glasses, a controller, and computers to handle the development of content and processing.  Additionally, software is required to serve as the operating system for the visualization unit to allow users to load and display interactive visualizations.</p>
<p>The visualization system will be purchased by BARDA and will be part of a new HHS Innovation Lab that is currently being developed by ASPR, BARDA, the HHS Chief Technology Office and other HHS stakeholders. GSA has contracted separately with an Architecture/Engineering Design firm to complete the space planning for the Innovation Lab project.  This Statement of Work addresses specifically the requirement for a turnkey visualization system from project design consulting through delivery, configuration, testing, operations and maintenance of a system.</p>
<p><br />The overall scope of work is for potential vendors to propose a specific visualization system (including both hardware and software) that meets the Technical Specifications outlined in ATTACHMENT 1, STATEMENT OF WORK. Once the visualization system is installed, the vendor shall provide operations and maintenance support through onsite system operation and administration and maintenance of additional components needed to support content development within the Innovation Lab and BARDA Modeling and Visualization Hub.</p>
<p>For The Viz Hub to be flexible and nimble to meet the requirements of the PHEMCE and the United States Government (USG) Continuity of Operations (COOP) initiative, the Viz Hub needs to be an integrated, standalone unit that can be transported and reassembled with minimal modifications at alternate locations, assuming adequate space, power, and cooling, if necessary. The Viz Hub shall require daily operations and maintenance support and periodic technology upgrades as new updates replace older hardware models and software versions.<br /><br /><strong>PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT 1, "STATEMENTO OF WORK," FOR FURTHER DETAIL AND A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL REQUIRED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS&nbsp;<br /><br />**************************************************************<br />This notice is to amend the RFQ posting to include all questions and answers recieved<br />**************************************************************<br /><br />Question: </strong><strong>ATTACHMENT_1_SOW CLIN 0001 identifies the virtual reality software requirements but does not identify an operating system restriction. Will a solution available only on one operating system still meet this SOW requirement?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:  Yes, a virtual reality software solution that is available only on one operating system will meet the requirement for the SOW.   <br /> <br />Question: </strong><strong>Optional services (CLIN 0003) (a) indicates the "person provided shall be required to pass the&nbsp;necessary background check to fulfill HHS security policy to report for duty." Is there a specific security clearance requirement?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: There is no requirement for a security clearance.  HHS must complete a background check for a HSPD-12  identification card.<br /></strong></p>

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 0002 is: 1) to provide Questions and Answers generated in response to this presolicitation notice, 2) to delete Civil Engineer from Secondary Key Personnel under Section C.7 Key Personnel Labor Categories of the Statement of Work, 3) to delete Civil Engineer from Secondary Key Personnel under the Key Personnel Professional Qualifications section of the instructions for submittals, 4) to delete Civil Engineer from Table H-1, and 5) to extend the date for receipt of the SF-330s to no later than 2:00 pm EST on April 14, 2015.<br /><br />The purpose of Amendment 0001 is to correct the set-aside to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The response date and time is not extended.<br /><br />This is a call for submittal of Standard Form (SF) 330s from Architectural and Engineering (A-E) firms to support the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) long-term housing strategy and NRC's restoration and refurbishment activities. Currently, the long-term housing strategy will consolidate NRC headquarters at the White Flint Complex (WFC) located in Rockville, Maryland. The WFC consists of three buildings located at the following addresses: (1) One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20850; (2) Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20850, and (3) Three White Flint North, 11601 Landsdown Street, North Bethesda, MD 20850. The Government intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task ordering contract (see attached Statement of Work). This competitive procurement has been set aside for qualified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB). All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit qualifications. The designated NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, with a size standard of $7.5 million. The NRC anticipates contract duration of one base year, plus four one year option periods. Required services will be for architectural, engineering and related services, which will be accomplished through the issuance of individual firm-fixed-price and/or time-and-materials task orders. The total value of all task orders issued against the IDIQ contract shall not exceed $4,000,000 over all five years. The Government guarantees a minimum of $75,000 for the contract term. The minimum guarantee is typically met by the issuance of the first task order. The design services to be performed under this contract may include, but are not limited to: 1) conducting engineer-led field surveys, graphical surveys, and analysis of existing work space and planned work space; 2) preparing engineering studies; 3) creating coordination reports of recommended actions and/or design packages; 4) developing program of requirements, cost estimates, specifications, test fits, space plans, audio-visual plans, design intent drawings (DIDs), and construction documents (CDs), 5) providing project management, 6) providing construction administration, and 7) obtaining permits. This requirement is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (P.L. 92-582) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Please refer to FAR Subpart 36.602, Selection of Firms for Architectural-engineering Contracts, for evaluation and award procedures to be followed under this pre-solicitation notice.
<p><br />Services will be provided primarily for the NRC White Flint Complex located in Rockville, MD. The firm and major architectural or engineering consultants must be licensed to practice their respective professions. Per FAR 36.209, the firm or joint venture awarded a contract for these required services will not be eligible to compete for any construction contracts awarded using the documents prepared as a result of this pre-solicitation notice. Therefore, all prospective offerors are cautioned to review the restrictions of FAR Subpart 9.5 (Organizational Conflicts of Interest) and NRCAR 2052.209-72 (Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest (JAN 1993) prior to submitting their qualification for consideration. The NRCAR can be reviewed at the following website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/other/nrcar/2052.htm.

<a href="mailto:david.a.gannon.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to extend the ordering period of the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions - 2 Services (ITES-2S) contracts.  ITES-2S includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  The ITES-2S scope remains the same during the extension and encompasses all requirements for IT services, including related incidental hardware and software for providing end-to-end solutions.  The proposed contract action is for services and related incidental hardware and software, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the ITES-2S contractors under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    <br>    <br> The current contracts are scheduled to expire on 13 April 2015.  The contract extensions will have an extended ordering period of 36 months, from 14 April 2015 through 13 April 2018.  The extensions will provide for continuation of uninterrupted services to Army, other DoD, and all other Federal agency customers while the effort is re-competed.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals and NO solicitation is available.  Not awarding this extension would cause serious harm to the Government.  However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified.  Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement in the timeframe required.  Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source extension described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of Ilana Christine Bohren, the Procuring Contracting Officer.  Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Mr. David Gannon at david.a.gannon.civ@mail.mil, no later than 1400 CT on 19 March 2015.  <br>

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.            <br>                         <br>            The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.            <br>                        <br>            The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.              <br>                              <br>            This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.              <br>                        <br>            If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.             <br>                        <br>            The above discussed intent is subject to change.             <br>                      <br>           ---Change 1---            <br>                       <br>           The purpose of this change is to provide an updated Manpack Radio request for information document for proposed CPD changes.  The updates are included in the newly added Section 3 Proposed CPD Mission Weight Detail.  Submission instructions remain unchanged from the original announcement.          <br>                    <br>           ---Change 2---            <br>                    <br>          The purpose of this change is to extend the submission date and revise the submission instructions for responses to the proposed CPD requirements changes.          <br>                    <br>          All questions/comments pertaining to the document posted today shall be submitted no later than November 7, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil.  Questions/comments should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats.  E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size.  If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate e-mail messages.  Reference W15P7T-15-R-0004 in the e-mail subject.  All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.  Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.            <br>                        <br>          All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.         <br>                  <br>         ---Change 3---         <br>                  <br>         The purpose of this change to this announcement is to conduct a new Request for Information (RFI) for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radios. Please note that this new RFI is separate from the initial RFI posted under this announcement for solicitation number W15P7T15R0004 regarding changes to CPD requirements, which is still in effect.         <br>                  <br>         The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to integrate onto Government specified vehicle mounts including the AN/VRC-116 Single Manpack Tray Assembly, the AN/VRC-117 Dual Manpack Tray Assembly, and the Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) Manpack Universal Tray.

The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.             <br>                          <br>             The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.               <br>                                <br>             This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes and exploring alternative solutions and determining industry standards for operations and maintenance of Managed Desktop and Virtualization services as described herein.<br />The Defense Health Agency Health Information Technology Directorate (DHA HIT) Infrastructure and Operations (I&amp;O) Division consisting of medical Information Technology (IT) elements, provides full life cycle management support for information systems and services. The DHA HIT Engineering, Design, and Deployment (EDD) Branch provides research, engineering, design, system architecture and development, testing and evaluation services to the aggregate joint Army Medical, Air Force Medical, Navy Medical, and command elements, ensuring new system designs meet DHA and service medical business needs and integrate the supporting technology into the existing complex environment. The DHA HIT I&amp;O Operations Support Branch (OSB) sustains the life cycle management support for information systems and services. <br />As part of this service, Desktop virtualization is required to centrally manage the end user device environment for the military health system in the Pacific Northwest, with the possibility of expanding this service to additional sites. The exact makeup may vary from site to site. A modular approach is needed to enable DHA to adjust the tasks for the contractor based on the breakdown of work at any given site. As part of this requirement, DHA will be delivering this service through a combination of government and contractor resources, the exact make up of which may vary from site to site. The plan is to establish a contract mechanism through which the selected vendor will operate the service, provide engineering and other services, but will not establish or develop the framework. It is anticipated that the first requirement will be a smaller portion to enable the DHA lessons learned for a follow-on larger requirement that may include all DHA regions. <br />Period of Performance - estimated start in July. Anticipates deployment to Pacific Northwest Region (PNW) this fiscal year.<br />Place of Performance: Fort Sam Houston Texas but will deploy to regions as required. Managed Desktop Tier 2, will be distributed at Air Force medical locations. <br />Purpose:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) will provide DHA with information that will be used in determining a path forward in its goal of implementing Managed Desktop and Virtualization within DHA.

<p>&nbsp;(a) The Government will evaluate bids in response to this solicitation without discussions and will award a contract to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors specified elsewhere in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) The Government may reject any or all bids, and waive informalities or minor irregularities in bids received.</p>
<p>(c) The Government may accept any item or combination of items, unless doing so is precluded by a restrictive limitation in the solicitation or the bid.</p>
<p>(d) The Government may reject a bid as nonresponsive if the prices bid are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. A bid is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that the bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even though it may be the low evaluated bid, or if it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.</p>

Description of Action: Request approval to award a new sole-source, 12 month <br> Period of Performance (POP), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract to Planet Associates <br> Inc. for Planet IRM software, enterprise licenses, maintenance, support, training and professional services. Funding for this requirement will utilize Fiscal Year (FY) 15, <br> Operation and Maintenance Army (OMA) funds. <br>  <br> 3. Description of Supplies / Services: The Contractor shall provide Planet IRM software and non-personal installation, maintenance, support, training and professional services to modernize (Redacted) to meet information assurance regulatory requirements, satisfy directives to upgrade servers to Windows 2008 R2, transition to virtual server environment, meet TechAmerica/ANSI EIA-649-B National Consensus Standard for Configuration Management, and comply with network accreditation requirements. This solution will align (Redacted) Planet IRM System initiatives. <br>  <br> The Contractor shall provide a working, manageable enterprise Planet IRM implementation that will enable continuous Change and Configuration Management (CM) of all IT configuration items throughout their lifecycle, cradle to grave. The Contractor shall provide capability to store large quantities of data with a disaster recovery plan that minimizes loss of CM services and data. The Contractor shall also provide a solution that aligns (Redacted)to provide stakeholders a common solution across (Redacted). The estimated value is $1,273,611.00, with a Period of Performance of twelve (12) months to begin on 01 April 2015 through 31 March 2016. <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: FAR   8.405-6(b), Limited Sources. <br>  <br> 5. Reason for Authority Cited: The proposed source is Planet Associates, Inc., 24 Wampum Road, Park Ridge Road, NJ 07656. Pursuant to FAR   8.405-6(b), Planet Associates Inc. is the only source capable of providing the required software and service. The software is owned by and proprietary to Planet Associates, Inc. and, as result, only Planet Associates has the capability to provide the software, enterprise licenses, maintenance, support, training and professional services, which are necessary to meet the Government's requirements. Planet Associates Inc. has not provided a letter of supply or granted intellectual property rights to any of its partners or team members. <br>  <br> The Planet IRM Software has been approved through (Redacted). Thus, (Redacted) must deploy the same software to be aligned with the software deployed at (Redacted). Various authorities, including the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5110-11 which establishes policy and assigns responsibilities in accordance with the authority in section 2674 of title 10,United States Code, 000 Directive (0000) 5105.53, and 00003020.26 (References (a), (b) and (c)) for the operation and management of (Redacted) and DoD Directive S- 5100.44,  quote mark Defense and National Leadership Command Capability (DNLCC) (U), quote mark  July 9, 2008 (Controlled Document) directs the (Redacted) to provide the same capability in Fit, Form, and Feel of equipment in use or planned for deployed at (Redacted). For these reasons, (Redacted) must procure the Planet IRM software and services.  <br>  <br> The failure to procure the proposed Planet IRM software and services would result in unnecessary duplication of costs in excess of $1.5 million. (Redacted) has an existing contract in place for the same Planet IRM software and services for a base period of one year and two one-year options at a cost of $1.5 million. The only way to procure an alternative type software would be to have (Redacted) terminate its contract and compete the requirement for (Redacted). That would duplicate the prior (Redacted) effort and increase the cost exponentially. <br>  <br> 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted on this requirement and the details are set forth in the Market research section of this document. This research did not reveal any additional potential sources. There is no competition anticipated for this requirement. There were no efforts made to compete this requirement. Planet Associates Inc. is the only responsible source with the ability to provide the software and services required due to proprietary information. (Redacted) have a significant investment in Planet IRM software. It has become essential to the Government's requirements and there are currently no other companies with similar products that meet or can be modified to meet, the Government's needs. If competed, the substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered. Also, in accordance with DoDI 5110-11, (Redacted)has to provide the same Fit, Form, and Feel of the existing equipment (in use or planned for deployment) (Redacted). As stated above, the Planet IRM Software has been approved through (Redacted). The Planet IRM software is thus required by (Redacted) to ensure that its equipment has the same Fit, Form and Feel as the equipment being utilized at (Redacted). As discussed in the procurement history, (Redacted) has a contract in place for $1.5 million over a base year and two option years. <br>  <br> Consequently, to procure an alternative type software would require (Redacted) to terminate its contract and recompete a new one for (Redacted). Since this is a very specific requirement, there is a high likelihood that the government would end up procuring the same software with the same vendor, thereby duplicating and compounding prior cost outlays exponentially. This would not make sound business sense. <br>  <br> 7. Actions to Increase Competition. (Redacted) requirement can only be met by Planet IRM software and support services. If there is an acquisition for an entirely new infrastructure relationship management software, and the DoDI changes, allowing (Redacted) to deviate from using the same software at the (Redacted), then such an effort would be fully competed among all manufacturers meeting the specifications. <br>  <br> Furthermore, based on the current lack of responses to the Special Notice, the previous sole source award, and the expired CHESS contract, actions to increase competition have been attempted, but have been difficult to achieve due to the exacting specifications of the products and associated services.  <br>  <br> 8. Market Research. Market research has been conducted in conjunction with this acquisition. The agency conducted on-line research, and researched past and current Planet IRM Software and Support Services acquisitions. A special notice was placed on FedBizOpps on 15 January 2015, which stated that it was the government's intent to award a sole source FFP Contract for Planet IRM Software and Support Services in support of (Redacted). No responses were received to the FedBizOpps synopsis. <br>  <br> A search of the General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule 70 on 14 January 2015 indicated that there is only one vendor on the GSA schedule that can provide the Software and Support Services required: that vendor is Planet Associates Inc. under contract GS-35F-0928N. <br>  <br> A search for the Planet IRM Software and Support Services was done on FedBizOpps the past year and came back with no results for these service.  <br>  <br> The requiring activity provided information for the previous purchase of Planet IRM Software for (Redacted). This information is listed below in subparagraph 10a. under  quote mark Procurement History. quote mark  <br>  <br> 9. Interested Sources: In accordance with FAR   5.201, a special notice was posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) web site and transmitted to FedBizOpps on 15 January 2015. No responses were received to the FedBizOpps synopsis. <br>  <br> 10. Other Facts. <br> a. Procurement History: Previous Planet IRM Software and Support encompasses approximately three years under the following contracts:  <br>  <br> 1. (Redacted), awarded by the ACC Contracting Office located at Rock Island, IL (ACC-RI), was a FFP Sole Source contract award to Planet Associates Inc. using a J&A under authority of 10 U.S.C.   2304 (c)(1) and FAR   6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements in the amount of $1.5 million. This requirement was for the Planet IRM Software and Licenses to be used at (Redacted). The period of performance was for a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods. <br>  <br> 2. Planet Associates had a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) on the Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI). That agreement however, has now expired. ESI is currently working on a renewal BPA for Planet Associates Inc. but the renewal date is unknown. The Government sought and received approval for the use of a Non-DoD contract in accordance with DFARS   217.7802 to use the Planet Associates Inc. GSA contract. <br>  <br> 11. Technical and Requirements Certification:  quote mark I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. quote mark   <br>  <br> (Redacted) <br>  <br> 12. Fair and Reasonable Price Determination:  quote mark I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based upon price analysis, including comparison of the proposed prices with the current year GSA Contract prices, the independent government estimate, and pricing under current contracts for similar services. Based on the FAR   15.403- 1(b)(3) prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing data (10  U.S.C.     2306a and 41   U.S.C.     254b), certified cost and pricing data will not be required due to the requirement being a commercial purchase. quote mark   <br>  <br> Edwin D. Guthrie <br> Contracting Officer <br>  <br> 13. Procuring Contracting Officer Certification: I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> Edwin D. Guthrie <br> Contracting Officer <br>  <br> Approval <br> Based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve the procurement of Planet IRM Software and Support on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority of FAR   8.405-6(b), Limited Sources, and provided that the services and property herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition. <br>  <br>  <br> Debra K. Parra <br> Special Competition Advocate <br>

<AWARDEE>Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, One Space Park, Redondo Beach, CA 90278 US
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to explore the feasibility of a wideband spread-spectrum RF communications system with greater than 10 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth. The system will operate below 20 GHz to mitigate atmospheric absorption and employ coding gain and spectral filtering for resistance to jamming. This program will explore what is possible to inform debate and future DARPA investment as this small study is planned as the first step in a potential larger effort. Proposed studies will advance via two thrust areas: 1) investigation of system architectures, channel propagation effects, spectrum regulation, signal processing techniques and culminating in a demonstration using commercial components and 2) the development of novel receiver technologies with a path towards a hand-held radio size, weight and power envelope.
<p>Dates<br />o Posting Date: 30 June 2014<br />o Proposal Due Date: 13 August 2014<br />o Estimated period of performance start: 15 December 2014</p>

<DESC>Award announcement for Jetties in Newburyport Harbor at Salisbury and Newburyport, MA. The work consists of repairing the 3100-foot-long North Jetty in Salisbury and completing repairs to the remaining (most seaward) 140 feet of the 1,500-foot-long South Jetty in Newburyport that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy. Approximately 30,000 tons of armor stone will be required - including approximately 5,000 tons of 14- to 19-ton armor stone. Crest width varies from 5 to 15 feet. Crest elevation at the most seaward end is +12.3 feet mean lower low water (mllw), and +17.3 mllw at the landward end. Side slopes are 1 vertical:1 horizontal on the river side and 2 horizontal:1 vertical on the ocean side. The work includes replacing displaced core and armor stone to fill in existing gaps in the jetty. Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement. Work also includes repair of a 190-foot-long stone spur off the North Jetty, approximately 600 feet seaward from the beginning of the jetty, and removal of two Navigation Aids (metal towers and concrete bases) from the North Jetty, and installation of new concrete bases. About 6 days per month during the construction window seas can be expected to be in excess of 8 feet in the river mouth. Stone deliveries to the jetties shall be done by water for the seaward half of the North Jetty and for the entire 140-foot portion of the South Jetty. Equipment and stone delivery and access to the jetty may be performed from land, water, or a combination for the landward half of the North Jetty. It is expected that there will be no seasonal constraints on the work. The expected storage/staging area for the stone, equipment, and trailer is on MA Department of Conservation & Recreation (DCR) property in Salisbury. Any DCR property, including the parking lot, dunes, and any excess vegetation damaged will be restored to their pre-construction condition. Contract duration is within 15 days from Notice to Proceed through March 31, 2016.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, Providence VA Medical Center, Research Service, Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology (CfNN).  Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for Transaction Number 650-15-1-881-0001.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Request that a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) be awarded to Blackrock Microsystems, LLC.  Blackrock Microsystems LLC manufactures Neural Signal Processing (trade named "NeuroPort") equipment used in multiple studies with the Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The NeuroPort Neural Signal Processing System - and its components/accessories - receives and processes neural signals from BrainGate2 trial participants.  CfNN has several funded and ongoing studies which require repeated acquisition of Neural Signal Processing Systems and components.  Establishing a Basic Ordering Agreement with Blackrock Microsystems, LLC will facilitate the purchase of equipment, components and accessories not yet developed.  Equipment used for this cutting-edge research continually evolves which makes it difficult to purchase.  Establishing the Basic Ordering Agreement will allow for the smooth acquisition of new and upgraded equipment without repeated and extensive contracting requirements.   The Blackrock Microsystems equipment will support VA-funded studies for the next several years.    

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	( )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Blackrock Microsystems, LLC is the sole manufacturer of the NeuroPort Neural Signal Processing System.   This is specific and unique research-based equipment that processes neural (brain) signals and transmits the signals to interface equipment.  The main NeuroPort Neural Signal Processing System and components/accessories are only compatible and acceptable from the original equipment manufacturer.   Blackrock is the proprietary owner of the NeuroPort system.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  No attempt was made to solicit offers from other sources.  The NeuroPort Neural Signal Processing System and components are only available through Blackrock Microsystems, LLC.  A notice was posted in FBO as required by federal regulations but due to the proprietary nature of the software and components, only the suggested vendor can meet the requirements.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Using pricing provided for past purchases, an Independent Government Cost Estimate for the BOA will be developed.   An estimate of future usage (based upon past usage) is that the total estimated value of the 5-year BOA will be approximately $2.5M.    Additionally, information on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold will be required.  Contracting Officer will perform cost analysis to make a determination of fair and reasonable pricing.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was not conducted.  The Basic Ordering Agreement is for purchase of Neural Signal Processing Systems and components for which only the manufacturer's proprietary equipment and accessories are compatible.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The NeuroPort Neural Signal Processing System and the many components are unique research equipment items critical to the Brain-Computer Interface projects associated with the Providence VA Medical Center (Research and Development Service) and Brown University, our affiliate institution.  Equipment components and accessories evolve and improve over time, yet are only compatible with the main NeuroPort system.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  An FBO notice was posted on October 3, 2014 with a response date of October 20, 2014.  In accordance with FAR 5.203, the notice was published for at least 15 days before issuance of a solicitation.  There were no responses.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:    Due to the proprietary nature of the NeuroPort system, little can be done to increase competition.

Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required brand name software upgrades and support.  Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery is the only eDiscovery software that can continue to build upon VA's existing Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery Platform located at the AITC.  The current system has the ability to accommodate up to 3 Terabytes (TB) of processing capability.  In order to support the forecast growth of OGC users, an additional 5 TB of processing capability license upgrades are required.  Additionally, the Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery is the only software that has Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) decryption capability and Predictive Coding capability that supports OGC's eDiscovery process.  The PKI decryption capability is required so that users can process, search, analyze, and review digitally encrypted emails. Predictive coding allows review of the electronically stored and processed data in a very quick manner, reducing the number of attorneys required and the amount of time spent on discovery document research on various legal cases.  Ultimately this capability will allow existing OGC staff to increase their case load and will enable VA to better meet its discovery obligations to various courts and litigation forums by allowing the Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery system to process more data than it can today to complete case investigation and research in a timelier manner.  No other brand name software can meet these essential VA functional requirements.  The use of the existing platform and licensing model is critical to fully integrate additional OGC users into the existing platform located at the AITC.  Any other brand name software would be unable to interoperate with the currently fielded Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery System software.  Since the required Symantec Clearwell software is proprietary, only an authorized Symantec Clearwell reseller can provide the aforementioned software licensing, software updates and technical support services.  An upgrade will allow additional users to perform preservation, processing (such as decryption and de-duplication), searching, reviewing, analysis, and production of electronically stored information.  This will assist attorneys, custodians of relevant information, and other Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) personnel in accomplishing their required tasks more efficiently.  OI&T personnel use Symantec Clearwell in the event they need to assist in litigation and criminal cases where email users attempt to circumvent controls and try to prevent VA investigators and OGC from accessing their email records.    

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required brand name software upgrades.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized and the justification will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award and posted to NASA SEWP IV GWAC website along with the solicitation.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.  

8.  Market Research:  From September 2014 through December 2014, the Government's technical experts conducted market research by reviewing other similar brand name eDiscovery software applications, specifically from Hewlett Packard/Autonomy, International Business Machines, Enterprise Content Management, and AccessData.  Of the software applications researched, only the Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery software is able to meet VA's predictive coding and PKI decryption requirements.  Additionally, based on the review of similar brand name software, specifically from Hewlett Packard/Autonomy, International Business Machines, Enterprise Content Management, and AccessData, it was determined that none are able to interoperate with the existing Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery System software and architecture.  Each brand software product is proprietary and is therefore incompatible with software from other vendors.  Different architectures cannot communicate with each other.  Each brand eDiscovery application uses a different proprietary software code which makes communication between different brand names impossible.  As a result, the Government's technical experts have determined that only the Symantec Clearwell eDiscovery software and licenses can meet all of the Government's requirements.    

9.  Other Facts:  None.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
678-15-3-616-1233	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:
$27,316.12
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Southern Arizona VAHCS is requesting the EMERGENCY purchase of one-hundred (100) straps and twelve (12) Voyager PCBA Assemblies.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

This award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency.   There are many straps that have failed inspection due to being frayed and must be replaced to bring the lift back into safe working condition. The PCBA assemblies are another part of the motor that need replaced to bring the patient lift systems back in to service.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:
  
ArjoHuntleigh, Inc. is the manufacturer of the required items and as such is in the best position to provide the items in a timely manner.


5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Per FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii), bases on comparison of the proposed prices with prices found reasonable on previous purchases, and per FAR 13.106-3(a) (2) (iv), based on a comparison with similar items in a related industry and prior purchases from other VA hospitals the price is determined to be fair and reasonable.  This procurement is being placed as an open market item since the required services are not available from agent inventories, or under a GSA or NAC Schedule.

This requirement has been provided for the Southern Arizona VAMC under the open market pursuant to FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency and as such was exempt from competition.  Additionally, a search of FPDS revealed the following purchases made using the same NAICS code (339113) and PSC code (6515) as is being used for the current requirement and were awarded to ArjoHuntleigh, Inc.: 
o	The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a purchase order in the amount of $33,601.45 on 1 October 2010
o	The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a purchase order in the amount of $21,731.36 on 15 June 2011
o	The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a purchase order in the amount of $34,833.88 on 29 August 2011
o	The Department of the Air Force issues a purchase order in the amount of $26,980.00 on 25 September 2013
o	The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a purchase order in the amount of $53,960.00 on 23 April 2014
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
