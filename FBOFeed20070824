<DESC>Completely operational inboard jet-drive work boat between 21.5 and 22.5 feet in overall length.  Vessel must be maneuverable at low speeds (approximately 3 knots) and have sufficient thrust with a load capacity of at least 2,500 pounds, yet still able to get up on plane when transport upriver is necessary.  The vessel will be composed of all welded marine grade aluminum (5086 & 5052) with support braces.  The upper bow region of the boat must be of an open-deck style and flat with a working platform no less than 24 square feet in area to allow for a stable work area.  The working platform also needs to be a storage compartment.  The working platform needs to be 8 inches below the bow line.  The helm should be a "center-console" or mid-ship design.  All flooring should be covered with or composed of a non-slip material (e.g. roughened diamond plate).  Five, heavy duty attachment points (cleats) need to be welded to the hull as follows: (1) at bow, (2) along the port side gunnel (spaced 16' apart) and (2) along the starboard side gunnel (spaced 16' apart).  Additionally, a Samson's Post in the aft portion of the boat is preferred or two additional cleats along the stern will be needed.  Delivery will be facilitated if a trailer is made specifically for this workboat and would allow someone from this office to tow it to the station from point of origin. 	Main uses of this workboat will include rotary-screw trap placement and sampling in the Sacramento River at very low to very high water stage conditions.  The screw traps are large (22') pontoon-supported cones that float at the water surface and passively sample the downstream migration of juvenile fish past the Red Bluff Diversion Dam.  Once in place the traps are moved periodically when river conditions change, dam operations change or when flood events occur.  The boat will be used to maneuver these large sampling devices into place on the river and out of place under emergency conditions at all hours of the day or night.                Boat and trailer will be delivered with all items installed and will be fully tested as an integrated unit under actual operating conditions with a US Fish and Wildlife Service employee present, before delivery is accepted. See RFQ for additional specifications

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to award a sole-source contract for research and development to ANSTO, Inc, in accordance with FAR Part 15 and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements), under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304Â©(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253Â©(1).  The estimated cost of this acquisition is $4,950,000. This purpose of this acquisition is to establish a Research and Development (R&D) provider for a technical evaluation of the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) as a potentially competent, deployable, and economically viable technology to address various wastes as part of DOEâs Environmental Management mission. ANSTO has developed and holds data rights to unique HIP waste form technology needed for this R&D demonstration project; ANSTO, Inc., the US subsidiary of ANSTO, has exclusive rights to ANSTOâs proprietary waste form technology. This three-year project will demonstrate the risk reduction benefits that tailored waste forms and flexible HIP technology can provide to the DOE Idaho Cleanup Campaign.  The project will address the following areas: â¢ Technical and regulatory risks of tailored ceramic, glass-ceramic and metal encapsulated waste forms produced via hot-isostatic pressing (HIP).  Waste form performance will be base-lined, where appropriate, against borosilicate glass in terms of Waste Acceptance System Requirements (WASRD) and Waste Acceptance Product Specifications for vitrified high-level waste forms (WAPS) performance criteria. â¢ Scalability and reproducibility of waste forms for Idaho calcines will be evaluated â¢ Technical demonstration will be performed using a hot-cell HIP facility at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) â¢ Process flow sheets and scaled demonstration showing the applicability of HIP technology to a broad range of target Idaho wastes, with primary focus on aluminium (Al) and zirconium (Zr) calcines â¢ Safety, industrial maturity, flexibility, nuclear application, and production scale deployment of HIP technology â¢ Preliminary estimate of projected costs for technology deployment for treatment/compaction of Idaho calcined HLW â¢ Proof-of-concept demonstrations of the risk reduction benefits of tailored waste forms and the flexibility of HIP technology for waste streams other than calcine to support DOE Idaho Cleanup Program (ICP) â¢ Target waste simulates for the proof-of-concept demonstrations to include: Al and Zr calcine, steam reformed SBW (both mineralized and carbonate forms), corroded fuel pins/rods, fuel basin sludge, impure actinide residues, higher-purity actinide feeds, cesium and strontium wastes and technetium THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY DOE TO PAY FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTIFICATION.

However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may provide a written, narrative statement of capability prior to the response due date of October 9, 2007. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award to ANSTO, Inc, without publishing a solicitation. Responses are due by October 9, 2007, 5:00 p.m. (MDT).  All responses shall be submitted via e-mail to foggjc@id.doe.gov. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

The FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Division requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing:  CLIN 0001:  Carpet to be provided and installed in the quantity and in accordance with the specifications listed herein.   A SITE VISIT AT BLDG 410 (NAVICP MECHANICSBURG) IS SCHEDULED FOR 30 AUGUST 2007 AT 10:00AM.  CONTRACTORS MAY CONTACT  LUANN RUSSELLl, NAVICP, 717-605-1428    or Wesley S. Dennis,  NAVICP  OSX2, 717-605-3763 TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR ACCESS TO THE NAVICP AND FOR ANY DIRECTIONS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. STATEMENT OF WORK FOR NAVAL INVENTORY CONTROL POINT (NAVICP) MECHANICSBURG BLDG 410 CARPET ACQUISITION AND INSTALLATION NAVICP has a requirement to replace old, deteriorated carpet in Building 410 at the Naval Support Activity (NSA).  This project is consistent with our long range facilities Quality of Life Improvement Plan (QOLIP) to upgrade all NAVICP administrative workspaces.  The new carpet will consist of 24"x 24" modular carpet tile, versus rolled broadloom carpet.  This modular carpet minimizes replacement costs due to damage, untreatable stains or renovation changes and is less costly to install in occupied spaces.  Several types of carpet are required.  Two types of special building entrance carpets are required to capture exterior dirt, snow deicing materials and other contaminants before entering the main hallway or lobby entrance areas.  This specialized carpet preserves the life of the main carpets and minimizes janitorial costs of carpet cleaning.  The other carpet requirements for the open administrative office spaces, central hallways, wing hallways and private offices are ne!  eded to provide an aesthetic, professional appearance with a high durability carpet material, reducing long term maintenance and premature replacement costs. For appearance and consistency with existing furniture and office color schemes, carpet samples must be provided to the NAVICP Business Office for color and pattern approval. NAVICP requires 7,869.30 square yards of new carpet for this project along with 8,400 lineal feet of cove base.  Carpet thresholds for all transition spaces are also required. All VCT floorings must be stripped waxed with patching and repairs as necessary.  6,500 SY of existing carpet is to be removed and disposed.   Approximately 380 square yards of carpet referenced above is for overage (attic stock).   Government's preference is to match 1,272 square yards of existing carpet previously procured from Mohawk Carpet Corporation, Lees Carpet Division.  If matching carpet is not available, the in-stock carpet may be excessed as a loss to the government if it cannot be utilized elsewhere, making the new carpet requirement a total of  9,141 square yards.  On-site visit(s) by prospective bidders is required to understand requirements for cut ins, thresholds, borders, and confirmation of total SY requirements.   It is requested that the vendor offer a guaranteed lifetime warranty on all carpets against dishing, doming, cupping, crushing, matting, fading.  Must be static free, colorfast stain-resistant yarn with 96% or better stain resistance. A Duracolor or similar yarn dyed stain resistant material is required.  Backing material shall be a superior tuft bind with no edge ravel, no seam sealers, no delamination and impervious to moisture.  Surface texture is to be textured loop graphics, 1/8" gauge with finished pile thickness .123" (3.1 mm) average.  Face yarn weight is to be 22 oz per SY .All primers and pressure sensitive adhesives must be approved by the carpet manufacturer to ensure a lifetime warranted installation on adhesives.  All materials required for installation are to be included in this solicitation. Installation time must ensure an overnight set up for next business day traffic. Carpet selected for entrances to capture initial dirt should be of tufted construction, 5/32" gauge; DuPont nylon 6.6 with 6.6 scraper died yarn, with reinforced synthetic/fiberglass backing.  This carpet shall also have a lifetime warranty on wear (no more than 10% face yarn loss), static, edge ravel delamination and tuft bind.   To ensure the government the opportunity to purchase material, installation and follow-on customer support services from one entity, we request a single prime vendor be awarded responsibility for both material and installation to limit liability to a single source.  Other than the hallways, the administrative spaces are occupied with modular and standalone furniture, files, bookcases, some safes, water coolers, coffee messes, filing systems and other typical office furniture.  This installation must incorporate a furniture "lift system" to install the carpet.  No computer equipment can be detached from local area network cabling during the installation process. Installation must occur after hours or on weekends and coordinated with appropriate Navy personnel.  All spaces must be completed and available for employee access to work following each evening/weekend phase of the installation to preclude any work stoppage.   Contractor personnel must obtain access to the installation under existing security procedures. POC at NAVICP Mechanicsburg:  Luann Russell, NAVICP, 717-605-1428    or   Wesley S.

Technical - Commercial Product Information shall be submitted which demonstrates the contractors compliance with the requirements set forth in the solicitation. 	2.	Past Performance - The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.

The Gove!  rnment reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified businesses, organizations, colleges, universities and institutions to award a contract to serve as the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The Genetics Repository will provide for the continued storage, maintenance, quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. The Genetics Repository facilitates the sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and, perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. The Genetics Repository helps ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.

The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository in order to accomplish the following activities in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Receive blood samples from NIDDK funded grants and contracts.
?	Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples.
?	Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines.
?	Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in variety of customized formats.

Since 2003, Rutgers University has served as the contractor for the NIDDKGenetics Repository. Request for Proposal No. NIH-NIDDK-07-05 will be issued at the www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about September 8, 2007 with a receipt date for proposals on or about November 20, 2007. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified businesses, organizations, colleges, universities and institutions to award a contract to serve as the NIDDK Biosample Repository. The Biosample Repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner. This facilitates the sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields. The Biosample Repository helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.
 
The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository in order to accomplish the following activities in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner: 

?	Receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies. 
?	Carry out specified sample processing and analyses.
?	Widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators.

The specimen archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment. The samples were collected over several years from carefully chosen subjects and are present in a finite quantity. Each sample is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated. Therefore, it is essential that the samples be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from sample type to sample type. The contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful management of an archival storage facility that stores various types of biosamples, including blood, stool, urine, DNA, and tissue, and that distributes aliquots to many different investigators. The contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out technical tasks accurately and reproducibly. As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples. Finally, the contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract, and to prevent repeated shipment of samples from storage site to storage site, as shipment can sometimes damage these unique materials.

NUMBER OF STUDIES
This project will potentially serve fifteen or more large multi-site NIDDK funded studies. 

?	The range for existing samples is 1,400,000 to 1,900,000 individual specimens in vials or slides. In addition, 20,000 to 60,000 new samples, in multiple aliquots (5 ? 20 vials), will be received annually.

Since 2003, Fisher BioServices (formerly McKesson BioServices) has served as the contractor for the NIDDK Biosample Repository. Request for Proposal No. NIH-NIDDK-07-06 will be issued at the www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about September 8, 2007 with a receipt date for proposals on or about November 20, 2007. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified businesses, organizations, colleges, universities and institutions to award a contract to serve as the NIDDK Data Repository. The Data Repository stores the data from large clinical studies, including data associated with the stored biosamples, and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories. The Database Repository, acting as a central coordinating entity, facilitates efficient distribution of data and samples. As an archive and distributor of highly usable legacy datasets, the Repository also allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biosamples, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations.

The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Data Repository in order to accomplish the following activities in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Assist study coordinating centers and the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories in setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data.
?	Maintain a central inventory of samples from the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies.
?	Receive and test the validity of electronic databases from completed studies.
?	Maintain and distribute those databases, including administering review of access applications.
?	Provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries.
?	Create and maintain a website for all of the NIDDK Central Repositories.
?	Carry out activities to advertise the availability of samples and data to the research community.

The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment. The data from each study represents the efforts of hundreds of investigators over five or more years to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of hundreds or thousands of patients and family members. The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and therefore it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage or misuse. The contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful database management. The contractor?s staff must be highly trained to work with, maintain, and analyze numerous databases, including those in Oracle and other DBMS?s. As all the work is with data from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical issues involved in handling subject data. Finally, the contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.

Since 2003, Research Triangle Institute (RTI) has served as the contractor for The NIDDK Data Repository. Request for Proposal No. NIH-NIDDK-07-07 will be issued at the www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about September 8, 2007 with a receipt date for proposals on or about November 20, 2007.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13.1, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-07-00304 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate  Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), Energy Star? Residential Branch requests that you submit a project plan and quotation for the award of a Purchase Order for "The Energy Star Multi-Family, High-Rise (MFHR) Program."       STATEMENT OF WORK: The mission of CPPD is to reduce emissions of  greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. CPPD forges partnerships with private and public organizations to accomplish this goal through the promotion of cost-effective energy-efficient technologies. CPPD delivers the technical information and tools that organizations and consumers need  to choose energy efficient solutions and best management practices. ENERGY STAR is a one of CPPD's voluntary partnership programs. ENERGY STAR promotes energy efficiency in products, homes, and buildings in an effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through its effective use of the ENERGY STAR  label. When placed on products, homes, and buildings the label signifies superior energy efficiency. Beyond the label, ENERGY STAR strives to improve energy performance in buildings and existing homes that may never achieve the label, but can still realize considerable energy savings. The ENERGY  STAR label has been jointly managed by EPA and Department of Energy (DOE) since 1996. EPA is implementing a program to label  MFHR buildings that address the needs of the multifamily sector and work to improve the energy efficiency, health, safety, and security of all residential buildings with  four or more floors. As an initial step, EPA has embarked on a set of pilot programs to understand the unique issues related to labeling MFHR buildings. The purpose of this task order is to assist EPA in conducting these pilots and to help launch a national ENERGY STAR MFHR program.       BACKGROUND: MFHR buildings present a unique set of challenges to EPA that are not found in either the ENERGY STAR New Homes or Commercial Buildings Programs. These challenges have made it difficult to adapt existing program approaches and procedures to this sector. First, much of this sector faces  the split incentive issue where building owners are responsible for energy efficiency improvements but do not receive the benefit of lower utility bills. While the building owners may advertise their units as energy efficient, owners do not realize the financial benefits of energy efficiency.  Without the payback of reduced energy bills, building owners are less likely to invest in energy efficiency. Second, tenant turnover in multi-family residences is extremely high, approaching 50% a year for some building owners. This high turnover rate makes it difficult to educate tenants on  practices that reduce energy consumption throughout the building. Yet, occupant behavior and building management is a major factor in energy consumption of buildings. In addition, current residential modeling tools do not readily estimate the energy consumption of MFHR buildings. The modeling  problems are exacerbated in taller buildings. Finally, there is very little publicly available energy consumption data to develop a benchmark for this building type as is typically done in the ENERGY STAR Building Program. Building experts reviewing this data have commented on its poor quality. To  investigate these concerns and help develop a possible ENERGY STAR  MFHR program, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE), and interested states formed the National Working Group. The purpose of the National Working Group  was to help EPA define elements of a possible ENERGY STAR for  MFHR Program, and address several important barriers to the development of this program. In 2006, EPA approved a limited pilot program for the states of New York, Wisconsin and Oregon based on the work to date by the National Working  Group. Under these pilots, newly constructed buildings that are 20% more energy-efficient than a building constructed to ASHRAE 90.1.specifications, and are modeled to equal or exceed a score of 75 on RECS benchmark tool, can be labeled as ENERGY STAR for a limited set of buildings. The National  Working Group produced the following documents to assist projects in evaluating whether MFHR buildings met these requirements: Incremental Cost Guidelines, Minimum Performance Standards (MPS), Multi-Family ENERGY STAR RECS Benchmarking Tool, Simulation Guidelines, and System Performance Testing  Protocols. As a starting point for developing the most effective approach to a nationwide  MFHR buildings program, EPA is currently piloting the MFHR buildings program using the guidelines and documentation established by the National Working Group.      PURPOSE OF PILOT: The intent of this pilot  is to study the possibility of leveraging the ENERGY STAR mark to reduce energy use in the MFHR buildings sector. EPA will evaluate information obtained from the pilot to understand how and whether these goals are achievable at the national level. These pilots will provide useful information  concerning regional factors that address energy efficiency issues in the MFHR buildings sector. By working with our partners, EPA hopes to collect regionally specific information to determine whether ENERGY STAR can effectively serve the market to promote energy efficiency. The following 1) thru 4)  are criteria that EPA will apply to determine whether to expand ENERGY STAR beyond the pilot project stage for the MFHR sector. 1) ENERGY STAR is cost-effective. ENERGY STAR performance specifications must be cost effective. The additional cost of the energy efficiency improvements must be  outweighed by the annual energy savings. While developers may construct a building to their own specifications to meet the ENERGY STAR requirements, EPA must understand that there are cost-effective options to achieve the ENERGY STAR specification. 2) ENERGY STAR represents real reductions in  energy consumption. ENERGY STAR must represent true energy savings over standard construction. While the specification may be demonstrated through a modeling approach, ultimately, true energy savings must accrue to consumers. EPA works to demonstrate this link and value. 3) ENERGY STAR provides  value in the market for MFHR buildings stakeholders. ENERGY STAR must be a mark of distinction in the market place and is valued by building owners and tenants. 4) ENERGY STAR offers a process for achieving performance targets that is feasible and easy to implement. One of the main tenets of ENERGY  STAR is that its programs are easy to implement and understand. EPA will examine the quality and consistency of the energy modeling across the various pilots. In addition, EPA will examine verification protocols and the necessary qualifications for quality control inspectors.  TASKS:       TASK 1:  Review the adaptation of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G Modeling Guidelines by the Ad Hoc Working Group in the Simulation Guidelines. The contractor shall assist EPA to complete the definition of the reference building and a proposed design, using the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 Appendix G Guidelines. The  contractor shall examine the Simulation Guidelines developed by the ad-hoc multi-family working group. With these guidelines, the contractor shall identify areas that may require additional research as well as propose possible default inputs that may be used to define the reference building. In  adapting Appendix G to residential structures, the contractor shall anticipate the various building configurations posed by MFHR.  Deliverable: Memo to COR outlining the current status of the Simulation Guidelines and its applicability to various building types and climates, and recommendations for  possible research to complete the guidelines. Due Date: to be determined by Technical directive once the contractor and COR have reviewed the guidelines to better understand the level of effort.        TASK 2: Complete necessary analysis and research to complete any gaps in the Simulation  Guidelines identified in Task 1. Through technical direction from the COR, the contractor shall perform analysis and research needed to complete the Simulation Guidelines for national use. The memo developed under Task 1 shall serve as the basis to identify these tasks. The contractor's analysis  shall include input from regional stakeholders most familiar with the climate and building types. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assume three research efforts during the period of performance. Each shall require 40 hours of contractor time to  complete.) Deliverable: To be determined by Technical Directive.     TASK 3: Program Specifications. The contractor shall assist EPA in assessing the appropriate specification for the ENERGY STAR MFHR program. Currently, the pilot specification requires a newly constructed building to be 20% more  energy efficient than a building constructed to ASHRAE 90.1.specifications (2004), and modeled to equal or exceed a score of 75 on RECS benchmark tool. The contractor shall assist EPA to: Determine whether the current specification is cost-effective within the pilot programs as well as in other  parts of the country, based on information received from the pilot programs. Identify cost effective energy reduction measures for the 8 climate zones found within the United States to achieve the ENERGY STAR specification required in the pilot program, for the various MFHR building types.  Recommend required energy efficiency measures that should be incorporated in all MFHR buildings to optimize performance.(For the purpose of estimating level of effort, the contractor shall focus on 2 climate zones with no more than three different building types in each climate zone) Deliverable:  to be determined by Technical Directive.         TASK 4: Verification Procedures. System Performance Testing Protocols are a set of requirements for verifying the installed performance of a building. The National Working Group document outlines testing protocols, performance specification criteria,  documentation requirements, and sampling protocols for assuring quality assurance. The contractor shall review the System Performance Testing Protocols developed by the National Working Group and identify the relative costs, value and difficulty of each of the requirements. In addition, the  contractor shall identify any additional verification steps that may be appropriate to verify the energy efficiency of the MFHR. The contractor shall assess the cost and value of this omitted verification step to allow EPA to make an informed decision as to whether to include this additional  verification step. In addition, the contractor shall assess the necessary qualifications required of personnel who may serve as verifiers under the ENERGY STAR MFHR Program. The contractor shall also review the existing certification and accreditation organizations to determine whether their  current certifications may serve to qualify technicians as capable of verifying the energy efficiency improvements. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assess the costs and value of the various System Performance Testing Protocol procedures, identify  possible missing procedure and list possible organizations that may qualify technicians). Deliverable: Draft report to EPA. Due Date: Six weeks after EPA's formal acceptance the contractor's work plan. Deliverable: Final report to EPA. Due Date: Three weeks after receipt of comments from EPA.      TASK 5: Analysis. The contractor shall assist EPA with analyses of the MFHR buildings data from current and future pilots as well as other topics that are relevant to the program. These ad-hoc analyses arise in the course of the development of environmental programs and shall be determine through  technical directives issued by EPA. (For the purpose of estimating level of effort for this task, the contractor shall assume that EPA will request two technical analyses that would require no more than twenty four work hours each by the contractor.) Deliverable & Due date: to be determined by  technical directive.       OTHER REQUIREMENTS. Progress Reports. The contractor shall report progress to the EPA COR on all tasks via phone or e-mail periodically and via written monthly progress reports.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Courtney Whiting, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Panalytical X-Ray for the repair and software upgrade of a Panalytical Fluorescence Spectrometer.  The repair and upgrade will require supply parts from the manufacturer (Panalytical) such as the X-Ray tube, lamps, power supply fan, and screens.  It will also require the services of the company installer to place them inside the XRF and test them.  After the repair is complete,  the XRF must be calibrated and the new software package installed with the training necessary to run the XRF. US EPA believes that only Panalytical can provide to the government new parts for the PW2404 X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer and have a factory repairman install them.  They are the only  contractor that can provide a licensed copy of the Super Q (operating system for the PW2404) upgrade which comes with the IQ standardless analysis software imbedded. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential  of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to  whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE.

Fax (244) 222 430 107.  Technical Assistance:  Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation and Hydropower Development.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance for the Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation and Hydropower Development project in Angola.  

With only 15% of Angola's population currently served by the electricity distribution system, rehabilitation and upgrade of the system are critical to the country's economic growth and political stability.  This Technical Assistance would develop master plans for two interior cities, Cuchi and Luena, to implement a modern distribution system with increased generation capacity from small hydroelectric plants.  Angola's Ministry of Energy and Water Affairs (MEWA) is the grantee.  

MEWA has already developed a sector strategy with other donor assistance that includes debundling the Angolan power sector while engaging the private sector in management, operation, and perhaps ownership of distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure.  Distribution has been prioritized in the strategy and this Technical Assistance has been recommended as the next step toward implementing this strategy.  The rehabilitation and modernization of distribution systems in the two cities could be used as a model for the rest of the country.  The project will facilitate the integration of previously isolated distribution systems; the development of appropriate tariff structures that will allow for the sustainable development of the electric power sector; and the introduction of small scale private power generation into the system.

National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) Bethesda, Md has a requirement for the VMAX Encore 29N Indirect Calorimetry System, model VS 2911, and the required accessories; a Sleep Diagnostic System, the Acquisition Stn 1 Bed Cephalo Ver 7, PN 776630-101, and the SomnoStart Pro Report Center. These systems will be used to diagnose and treat hospitalized patients.

The VMAX Encore 29N System is an Indirect Calorimetry System that is a reliable method of nutritional assessment of patients. Patients, especially individuals suffering from severe battle injuries, are at risk of significant malnutrition. These patients require the specialized capabilities of the VMAX 29N to assess their protein stores and energy expenditures to properly guide the delivery of appropriate nutrition. Normal equations used to estimate energy expenditure is insufficient to accurately diagnose seriously injured patients, who may be hypo- or hypermetabolic. The VMAX 29N accurately measures the patient's energy usage by a gas-exchange method of indirect calorimetry - the measuring of Oxygen consumed and CO2 produced, and this system is patient convenient as it has a mobile metabolic cart for bedside use. The Viasys VMAX Encore is equipped  with a canopy attachment that allows for testing of neonates. Other systems found have no capacity for testing neonates. The VMAX 29N is the only manufacturer that can be used as it is expanding the existing NNMC equipment, a non-mobile unit of the same manufacturer in the Pulmonary Department, which needs to be compatible for software interoperability and user training.

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable Indirect Calorimetry System is the Indirect Calorimetry System manufactured by Viasys Respiratory Care.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis; a multilaser upgrade to the government owned Nikon LCM 2000 laser confocal microscope. The upgrade will include a laser operating at 405 nm wavelength to work in concert with the three existing lasers and capable of activating the DNA stain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in a manner suitable for fluorescent microscopy, with Microcosm Inc., 6430 Dobbin Road, Suite B; Columbia, Maryland 21045. 

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The following salient characteristics apply:

Laser:  
-	Operates at 405 nm or shorter wavelength
-	Activates the dye stain 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); DAPI 405 nm laser shall enable the use of Hoechst, CellTracker Blue, Alexa 405 conjugated proteins, Pacific Blue conjugated proteins, and coumarin dyes as cell stains.
-	Incorporation into Nikon PCM 2000 for simultaneous operation with existing lasers
-	Enables Nikon PCM 2000 to acquire three channel images

Nikon PCM 2000:
-	optical parts of the Nikon PCM 2000 to provide transmission path of 405 nm laser energy to the sample
-	laser assembly into cabinet approximately 24 x 18 x 8 inches
-	photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to record intensity of 405 nm light

Justification:  

NCI currently has a Nikon LCM2000 confocal microscope which has been the workhorse on projects related to analyzing -H2AX foci. However, in its present state, the microscope is not capable of obtaining images with DAPI, the best fluorescent dye for visualizing DNA. With an excitation band of 395-410 nm, DAPI is commonly excited with UV lasers.  This laser's emission is at the upper end of the DAPI excitation band, but this has been shown to adequately activate the molecule. In addition to DAPI, the 405 nm laser will further extend our capabilities to visualize Hoechst, CellTracker Blue, Alexa 405 conjugated proteins, Pacific Blue conjugated proteins, and coumarin dyes.  The aforementioned will provide the capabilities stated above.

Benefit

The upgrade will allow the NCI to make observations that cannot be made on the present equipment. Two types of observations are particularly important. The first is the ability to visualize nuclear DNA with DAPI, which helps differentiate different chromatin environments of the DNA, such as eu- and hetero-chromatin. The ability to make such observations will permit the NIC to study the differential repair of DNA DSBs in the various chromatin subregions, and help  better understand the impact of DSB nuclear location on its potential for DAN damage and cancer industion. Secondly, the addition of a laser for DAPI will permit the NCI to visualize at least two and perhaps three other dyes, enabling us to design experiments that measure the rate of accumulation of DNA repair proteins to these foci. Addition of the 405 nm laser will provide higher quality images thus allowing us to perform better experiments.  
Microcosm Inc is the only source known to the NCI that is the sole Nikon factory-authorized service provider for the Nikon PCM 2000.  The ML4 upgrade is custom-made by Microcosm and modified to the customers needs and specifications. 
This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on September 10, 2007.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-70150-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>This VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Vista Technology Inc., 8432 45th St. NW, Edmonton, Alberta, CA T6B2N6 for the Isoplater 180, an automatic Petri dish streaking machine.  The Isoplater 180 automates the streaking of culture specimens on solid culture media, in Petri dishes.  The Isoplater 180 eliminates the manual procedure while improving isolation rates, standardizing results, increasing productivity, ensuring personnel protection, and lowering costs.  The Isoplater 180 is engineered to yield maximum colonial isolation with all specimen types and concentrations.  The patented streaking pattern assures complete utilization of the media surface area plus a high dilution factor between quadrants.  Standardized reproducible streaking with uniform high quality results make reading, enumeration and sub-culturing both easier and faster.  The use of the Isoplater 180 increases the recovery of pathogenic organisms.    The Isoplater 180 will improve productivity by automating the current manual streaking of plates per hour with robotic precision and efficiency, with every Petri dish being streaked identically.  Once the Isoplater 180 is loaded with inoculated plates, the Isoplater 180 automatically streaks the culture plates which frees up the staff to perform other duties. This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Vendors who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate item that will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 2:00 p.m. August 30, 2007.  Such notification must include a complete description of  the equipment that is required including narrative and capabilities as described above.  Responses may be sent to Kathleen.Policicchio@va.gov or mailed to Kathleen Policicchio, Contracting Officer (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206. Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The GMR will provide the interface between the Air Warrior computer (EDM) and the Aircraft mounted GPS antenna and the Blue Force Tracking (BFT) transceiver.   This effort will be accomplished in two phases.     In the first phase, based upon full and open competition, firm-fixed price contract(s) not to exceed $300,000 will be     awarded to a maximum of two offerors for the delivery of four (4) production rep resentat ive hardware samples and functional demonstration software.     The intent of Phase I is to promote competition through the delivery and initial Government evaluation of actual product samples. Competition for this effort will be limited to contra ctors who sa tisfy the following three requirements: -- Contractor must be Free from Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence (FOCI). --Contractor must have a facility clearance of SECRET or higher in accordance with DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Secu rity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). --Contractor is required to have a COMSEC account established by the US Government. This requirement is specified in DoD 5220.22A, Communications (COMSEC) Security Annex.       The Phase II procurement is for a 5-yea r IDIQ production contract that will be limited to the offeror(s) selected for the Phase I effort.     The estimated total lifetime hardware purchases from the Phase II contract is 6,000 units.     The Government will relea se a Phase II RFP with a product ion statement of work to the selected offeror(s) approximately 45-60 day prior to the specified delivery date for the Phase I hardware samples.     Offeror(s) shall submit their Phase II proposal concurrently with the delivery of their four GMR hardware sa mples required as deliverables for Phase I.     The Phase II RFP will require the offeror to provide pricing data to perform the production statement of work and provide GMR unit price data.     The contractor with the lowest price a nd technically accepta ble hardware, as determined through the performance of limited Government acceptance testing, will be awarded the Phase II production contract.       The release of the Phase I RFP is anticipated on or about 15 May 07.

<DESC>AMENDMENT A002 - Final Questions and Answers - 


Question 1 - Should the broadcaster submit copies of previous body of work?

Answer 1 ? Copies are not required but would be welcome as an indication of the bidder?s quality and ability to produce materials that fit the requirements of this project.

Question 2 - In terms of the entitlements listed as per the media vehicle used can the broadcaster give a holistic multi media plan ?

Answer 2 ? The Department would welcome creative ideas for a media plan, provided they would fit within the limited budget and tight schedules of the request for proposals.

Question 3 - In the document sent a preference for the English channels has been underlined can the broadcaster can also add regional channel mixes?

Answer 3 ? Proposals for regional channel mixes in support of the national coverage objectives of the program would be welcome.  However, if you propose to use languages other than English you will need to ensure that both the broadcast and the production sides of this procurement are in synch with your strategy.   One way to do this would be to bid for both procurements.  Another would be to include in a single bid subtitling or professional dubbing.   

Question 4 - The url of the website where we can access all the information for this programme?

Answer 4 ? For a link to the previous program for China, please refer to www.liuxueusa.cn for the Chinese and English-language materials that were broadcast and posted on the web. Please note, however, that for this project for India, we would like to have the programming materials reflect and appeal to an Indian audience and need not have a look or feel similar to the earlier program. 

For all details of the request for proposals and amendments for India, go to www.FedBizOpps.gov and follow these steps to reach all the documentation:

Go to www.FedBizOpps.gov; Click on ?FedBizOpps Vendors? button toward the bottom of the page; On next page, go to ?Acronym? pulldown in the center of the page and select DOC; On next page (entitled Postings of DOC by Office), alongside the NOAA entry click on ?location?.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous notice (dated 08FEB07) is to post the new Synopsis/Pre-solicitation Notice.
The Government intends to negotiate a performance-based Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract with Time and Materials/Firm Fixed pricing structure for professional, technical and analytical support services as required by the Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC NORFOLK) Norfolk, Virginia.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards.  This requirement will be solicited under Full and Open Competition.  The Contracting Officer will strictly avoid conflicts of interest in the Government-contractor relationship(s) that might result from this procurement by disqualifying any potential offeror who has a conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest, such as an organizational conflict of interest, at the prime contractor level an the subcontractor level.  A small business subcontracting plan will be required as part of the response to the solicitation. The subcontracting goal for this procurement is for 30% of the total contract dollars to be subcontracted to small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, HubZone small businesses, veteran owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran owned small businesses.  The resulting contract will have a period of performance from the date of award through 12 months thereafter and contain provisions for four (4) one-year option periods.  The FSC Code is D314 and the NAICS code is 541611.  Potential offerors should note that this requirement will be subject to the Service Contract Act and that some of the labor categories will require compliance with a current Department of Labor wage determination. The primary organization for this support is NIOC NORFOLK, Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, VA and subordinate commands NIOC San Diego, CA and NIOC Whidbey Island, WA with additional support to the Naval Network Warfare Command (NNWC) and the Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC.)  This support encompasses the mission areas of Information Operations (IO) and Information Warfare (IW) and includes support for missions, functions and tasks related to: Electronic Warfare, Operations Security, Psychological Operations, Military Deception and Computer Network Operations (CNO); Fleet training; strategic, operational and tactical planning; operational support and reachback; functional data management; Fleet IO requirements; experimentation; tactics evaluation; doctrine development; systems assessment; information technology management and administration; engineering and technical; and management and professional support services. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and any subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.fbo.gov (the Federal Business Opportunities Website- FedBizOpps.) This office no longer issues hard copy solicitations. By submitting a proposal, the contractor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency. Failure to so represent may be grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on or about 07 September 2007.  Selection of the awardee(s) will be made on a best-value basis; price and other factors will be considered.

<DESC>Solicitation N1577070010 THIS IS NOT A MODIFICATION / AMENDMENT FINAL Question(s) and Answer(s) 7.  QUESTION:  Will the firm fixed price of $55,000.00 per year adjust to include inflation if the option years are exercised?  ANSWER:  B.2 Minimum and maximum amounts.  The total quantity of services ordered will not exceed $55,000.00 worth of services per order.  The total quantity of services ordered in all orders shall not exceed $55,000.00  worth of services during the base year, and shall not exceed  $55,000.00  during each of the OPTION YEAR PERIODS. 8.  QUESTION:    In section B.3 DSC-91, Contract Price Schedule and Instructions, it seems to infer that there is a template we are supposed to fill out when we outline our pricing schedule. However, I have not been able to find a template that requests a breakout between lump-sum-prices versus unit-priced items as described in section B.3. Is there a template we are supposed to use or are we supposed to make one up?  "On lump-sum-priced line items, provide the total price only.  For all unit-priced line items, provide the unit price and the extended total price.  If no specific line item exists for a portion of the work, include the costs in a related item." ANSWER:  There is no template you need to prepare a pricing sheet in a format that you would use to explain your pricing.   Example:   Line Item Number 0001	Meeting & Facilitation	Quantity 8 hours	@  50/hr = $400.00	Total Cost  = $400.00 			Travel time/Travel Expenses	Quantity 4 hours	@  25/hr =  $100.00	Total Cost  = $100.00 			Duplication/binding materials	Quantity 2 hours	@  25/hr =  $  50.00	Total Cost  = $  50.00 Total Cost 		$550.00 Section C.1  STATEMENT OF WORK Quotes: 1.  Shall provide an hourly rate to include the following services:  Consultation by telephone and/or in person, independent research and development of meeting materials, meeting facilitation, compilation and preparation of meeting notes. 2.  In addition, quoters shall provide a per page rate for duplication/binding of meeting materials. 9.  QUESTION:  The Solicitation, Offer and Award form instruct offerers to submit an original offer and 2 copies. Is it required to include all 44 pages of the Clauses and Attachments with the original and each of the two copies of an offer?  If these Clauses and Attachments are required with the offer, would you please consider accepting an original and no additional copies of the Clauses and Attachments? Answer:  We require two original signed copies of the SF33.  You do not need to complete the Clause Section if you are registered in ORCA, however there are details within the Clauses that must be filled out accordingly such as K.4 listed below.  If you do not want to send 2 copies via USPS (United States Postal Service) then an electronically filled copy is acceptable with original signatures within Page 1 - Blocks 12 thru 17. 9. ANSWER:  Continued  K.4	52.204-08	ANNUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS	JANUARY 2006 (a)(1) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611. (2) The small business size standard is $6.5 Million. (3) The small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, other than on a construction or service contract, but which proposes to furnish a product which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. (b)(1) If the clause at 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, is included in this solicitation, paragraph (c) of this provision applies. (2) If the clause at 52.204-7 is not included in this solicitation, and the offeror is currently registered in CCR, and has completed the ORCA electronically, the offeror may choose to use paragraph (c) of this provision instead of completing the corresponding  individual representations and certifications in the solicitation. The offeror shall indicate which option applies by checking one of the following boxes: [ ] (i) Paragraph (c) applies. [ ] (ii) Paragraph (c) does not apply and the offeror has completed the individual representations and certifications in the solicitation. (c) The offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov. After reviewing the ORCA database information, the offeror verifies by submission of the offer that the representations and certifications currently posted electronically have been entered or updated within the last 12 months, are current, accurate, complete, and applicable to this solicitation (including the business size standard applicable to the NAICS code referenced for this solicitation), as of the date of  this offer and are incorporated in this offer by reference (see FAR 4.1201); except for the changes identified below [offeror to insert changes, identifying change by clause number, title, date]. These amended representation(s) and/or certification(s) are also incorporated in this offer and are current, accurate, and complete as of the date of this offer.  FAR CLAUSE # 		    TITLE 	DATE 		CHANGE ____________ 			_________ 	_____ 		_______ Any changes provided by the offeror are applicable to this solicitation only, and do not result in an update to the representations and certifications posted on ORCA. (End of provision) 10.  QUESTION:  My reading of the solicitation leads me to understand that travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with government regulations. Therefore, I assume that the line items in the offer should not include costs for travel.  The time to submit travel costs would be when the awarded contractor responds to a specific task order.  Have I understood this correctly? ANSWER: Section G.4 DSC-14  Travel, details the requirement.  You shall include the price within your quote and shall be at no additional expense to the Government.  Additional travel will be paid at the Government's expense if we authorize the travel.  Example, we need an additional two days not detailed in the Contract then we would in writing request this and negotiate the terms. 11. QUESTION:  It is difficult to tell what information would be of most service to you and meet your submission requirements for the Line Item Numbers 1-5 (Base and Optional Years). The intent of the statement "See Schedule" is unclear.  Can the submission leave Line Items  blank and provide a schedule of hourly rates and reproduction costs without providing a total cost? If I quote an hourly rate as the Unit Price, how can I determine the Total Cost when the number of hourly units will not be set until the government issues a Task Order?  Further, my reading of your needs and requirements leads me to believe that final agreement on the specifics of a task order are to be negotiated.  For example, the contractor might propose X number of hours for phone consultations prior to a Focus Meeting, the government might propose Y number of hours and the finalized order may specify Z number of hours. Although cost will not be the primary factor in evaluating offers, I want my offer to allow a meaningful comparison with other offerers and I do not want to obligate myself to an unknown amount of work at a predetermined fixed total annual cost based on the figure in the line items. ANSWER: Please see question number 8.  Yes, everything in the contract is negotiable.  We want the hourly rates detailing what your rates would be for the various items we are requesting.  12.  QUESTION:  The Statement of Work instructs offerers to quote an hourly rate for a number of different services. It also asks for a per page reproduction/binding quote.  If the only quotes provided in the offerers response consist of these two hourly rates without a total annual cost, will the offer meet your submittal requirements? ANSWER:  We want the hourly rates detailing what your rates would be for the various items we are requesting.  13.  QUESTION:  Will you accept separate hourly rate quotes for each of the listed services? (Consultation, facilitation, research and meeting material preparation, compilation of meeting notes)1. Section C.1, page 21, under the heading Focus Days, 2nd paragraph, the SOW reads, "Typically, the park Management Team holds five facilitated Focus Day meetings per year, lasting two to three days each."  During the execution of the prior contract was there a tendency for the Focus Day meetings to last for two days with greater frequency, or for three days? ANSWER:  We will accept hourly rates for each service.   	Example:  You were five days on site and 2 days at a Focus Days your breakdown might be: 1.	Time to Prepare the meeting 2.

QUESTION:  Section C.1, page 21, under the heading Focus Days, 4th paragraph, the SOW describes "calls to develop agendas, research to prepare meeting materials."  During the execution of the prior contract did the park acquire a sense for the amount of time typically devoted by the consultant to conference calls to develop the agendas? Would the park estimate that conference call time to be four hours or less per Focus Day meeting? How much time would the park estimate is required for the consultant(s) to devote to research required to prepare meeting materials per Focus Day meeting?  ANSWER: The time varied, that is why we are requesting an hourly rate breakdown.  As detailed in question 8 & 13. 15.   QUESTION:  Section C.1, page 21, under the heading Focus Days, 4th paragraph, the SOW describes a requirement for "an in-person meeting before each Focus Day session." What is the typical duration of this meeting? Does the park expect the consultant to be engaged in meeting preparation or related tasks for the entire day?

ANSWER: The Core Operations Analysis Process consists of the following: 	1.  Prepare a 5-year Budget Cost Projection (Prior Workshop) 	2.  Develop Park Purpose 	3.  Identify Park Priorities 	4. Review activities and Associated FTE 	5.  Analyze activities 	6.  Identify efficiencies, action to achieve and impacts 	7.  Wrap up review & next steps   	8.  Accountability & Accomplishments (Post Workshop) It is a working document that can change per the requirements within the Park Service. 17.   QUESTION:  Does the park have any sense of the amount of time it would like the consultant(s) to devote (separately or in aggregate) to the following work streams mentioned in the SOW: Core Operations Analysis (including operational analysis, analysis & recommendations on non-core functions, develop efficiency measures, budget planning, business process re-engineering) Organizational change consultation Development of dynamic funding strategies ANSWER:  I will try to address this question with what took place at a previous Reengineering Phase I. 	1.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, PDN is involved in a large phenomenological study focusing on the interrelationship between regression in autism and immune dysfunction. We propose to conduct a longitudinal natural history study of 50 children with autism and strictly defined regression, 50 children with autism and no history of regression, 50 typically developing children, and 25 children who meet criteria for Rett?s Disorder (a genetic disorder in which children have autistic features with clear regression). Subjects will be 12 to 48 months of age at study entry in order to capture regression as close to its onset as possible. Systematic prospective evaluations will be utilized in order to provide validation to the phenomenon of regression in autism, determine diagnostic and functional outcomes, and evaluate behavioral, medical and immunologic functioning.    

1. To characterize and validate the regressive phenotype in children with autism. 

2. To characterize the immune response in children with autism.
a. Distinct immunologic responses and cytokines abnormalities will be evident in children in the regressive autism sample, but not in the non-regressive autism, Rett?s Disorder, or typically developing samples.

3. To identify neurobiologic markers for autism through the techniques of metabolomics, proteomics and genomics (e.g. gene expression profiles). 

In addition, based on evidence of a pro-inflammatory profile seen in autism from the lab of Dr. Carlos Pardo, we have designed a treatment trial using the anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline.  Efficacy will be tested by examining the cytokine and chemokine profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fliud (CSF) before and after treatment.

The period of performance: 12 Months plus two option years. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690
and the Size Standard. An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI70098 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Kathleen Gregory, Contracting Specialist.

The acquisition method is negotiated procurement.  Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required.  The basis for award is Best Value Tradeoff.  This process permits tradeoffs among costs or price and non-cost factors and allows the Gove rnment to award to a superior offeror which is not the lowest priced offer but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offeror so as to justify payment of a higher price.  It is the Governments intent to award based on initial  offers without discussions.  Relative weighting of technical and price is as follows:  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  Evaluation factors may consists of the following: (1) Past Performance on projects similar in nature; (2) Specialized experience in constructing DoD facilities that serve as part of the world-wide satellite communications network, employing high reliability power and HVAC systems, foundations and utility interconnectivity with satellite communications antennas, and control & monitoring for restricted access to the complex ; (3) Key Personnel, including construction members;  (4) Project Management Plan that emphasizes communications with and responsiveness  to multiple users that will share the facility; ability to respond to user-installed equipment technology upgrades throughout the construction period, and aggressiveness in meeting or exceeding the construction period timelines, and (5) Small Business Uti lization Opportunities.  The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive. SITE VISIT:  A site visit is scheduled for September 13, 2007 at 10:00 AM local time.  Please contact Mr. Jack Janney at 805.734.4670 for additional information.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns or for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns. The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is to perform dockside repairs to the USCGC BEAR (WMEC 901), a 270 Foot Medium Endurance Cutter.  The homeport of the vessel is PORTSMOUTH, VA.  The performance period is TWENTY-FIVE (25) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about 20 SEP 2007.  The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the USCGC BEAR (WMEC 901).  This work will include, but is not limited to: Preserve Weather Decks; Resurface Flight Deck Surfaces.  Trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures, shall accomplish all welding and brazing.  At the present time, it is expected that the acquisition will be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to dawn.j.dabney@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4675.  Questions may be referred to Dawn J. Dabney at (757) 628-4636.  In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers; and (d) if your company does not own the drydock, a letter of commitment from the company providing the drydock committing to provide the drydock during the time period of this availability.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by Aug 29, 2007 @ 1200 p.m.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.   Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.

<DESC>A.	 General Information The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Custom OR Packs. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination for custom OR packs that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.   It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.  The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik , 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U.  S. CENTCOM. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAP A) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow the Prime Vendor to distribute their items. This is a supplement to t he Prime Vendor Program, and not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award wil l be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.   Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, 011-49-6221-172109, marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Custom OR Packs.  The estimated total annual volume for this product line in the Europe Region for this is $843,662. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Europe Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide product support to sites if requested, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informa tion, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil  Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  All interested offerors are to provide electronic responses.  This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, for providing samples and complete product literature at no charge for clinical evaluation purposes, and for submission of electronic best price offers.   Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from net work security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the above POC at the Europe Region TRBO that its initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to con firm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmissions before the due date/time should a problem occur with the first submission.  As stated above, vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  D.	 Source Selection Procedures The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this  initiative. Phase I:  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.  All te chnical/company criteria are equally weighted.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those qualified vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  Phase II:  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The CPT determined that this product line would be evaluated using both a literature review and a hands-on evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  As a result, literature review material and samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe TriService Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Vendors will be given 10 business days to ship samples.  Sample sets must  be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 10th business day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward a verification of sh ipment to the TRBO.   Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale of one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable; two is equal to minimally acceptable; three is equal to acceptable; four is equal to most acceptable; and five is e qual to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has set a 3.00 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.00 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualifi ed from further consideration in the standardization process.  Phase III:  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing o ffer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region.  Qualifying vendors will be given ten (10) business days to provide the TRBO their pricing proposals by email in a prescribed format.  Vendors failing to prov ide their pricing proposals by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated bas ed on best value to the government.  Pricing proposals are to be founded on a committed volume for a two-year base period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.

<DESC>A.	 General Information The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Lancets. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination for safety lancets that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.  The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik , 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U.  S. CENTCOM. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAP A) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow the Prime Vendor to distribute their items. This is a supplement to t he Prime Vendor Program, and not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is September 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award wi ll be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region. Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, 011-49-6221-172109, marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Lancets.  The estimated total annual volume for this product line in the Europe Region for this is $92,597. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Europe Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide product support to sites if requested, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informa tion, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil  Submissions must be received prior  to the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  All interested offerors are to provide electronic e-mail responses.  This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, for providing samples and complete product literature at no charge for clinical evaluation purposes, and for submission of electronic best price offers.   Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from networ k security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the above POC for the Europe Region TRBO that its initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confi rm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmissions before the due date/time should a problem occur with the first submission.  As stated above, vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified. D.	 Source Selection Procedures. The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region.  They are the decision makers for thi s initiative. Phase I:  Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the criteria.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.  All technical/company criteria are equally weighted.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those qualified vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  Phase II:  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The CPT determined that this product line would be evaluated using both a literature review and a hands on evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  As a result, literature review materials and samples for this product group will be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship literature and samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Vendors will be given 10 business days to ship samples .  Literature and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 10th business day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors mus t forward a verification of shipment to the TRBO. Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale of one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable, two is equal to minimally acceptable, three is equal to acceptable, four is equal to most acceptable, and five is e qual to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has set a 3.00 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.00 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualifi ed from further consideration in the standardization process.  Phase III:  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region.  Qualifying vendors will be given ten (10) business days to provide the TRBO their pricing proposals by email in a prescribed format.  Vendors fail ing to provide their pricing proposals by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated bas ed on best value to the government.  Pricing proposals are to be founded on a committed volume for a two-year base period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.	Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The CPT will review the following technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical  consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, o r is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardi zation initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Technical/Company: 1.	Is your company a manufacturer or distributor for a full line of safety lancets for use in adult, pediatric, and neonatal populations?  If yes, provide itemized brand(s) and styles (i.e. lancets that penetrate different depths) that are manufactured and /or distributed for safety lancets. 2.	Does the vendor have or is the vendor in the active process of applying for a DAPA number for safety lancets?  If yes, provide DAPA number. 3.	Will your company offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative?  (Note that vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.) 4.	Does the vendor have an agreement with the prime vendor (currently Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region?  If yes, provide prime vendor conversion number. 5.	Does your company have a history of back orders and/or recalls for the safety lancets?  If yes, explain in detail the, dates and duration, cause, and resolution. 6.	Is there a local vendor representative in the Europe Region for safety lancets?  If so, please provide their contact information.    7.	What kind of staff training does your company provide? 8.	Does your company provide a 24/7 customer service for Europe-based US military facilities? 9.	Do your safety lancets offer quick, one-step blade activation, automatic and permanent blade retraction to minimize the possibility of injury, and rapid, precise, consistent incisions providing quality blood samples? 10.	Is your lancets latex free and clearly labeled as such?  11.	Are educational and instructional materials provided as package inserts in every box? 12.	Does your company provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic excel format upon request? 13.	Are your lancets made from material that has sufficient strength for normal use? 14.	Because safety lancets activate in milliseconds with ultra-sharp, surgical, stainless steel blades and needles, are your companys safety lancets intuitively easy to use, with a single consistent strike with a minimal amount of pain? 15.	Does your companys product line of safety lancets comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) requirements for use by clinical personnel per the Needle Stick Prevention and Safety Act to prevent the spread of blood borne pat hogens?  If yes, explain how your company complies with OSHA requirements. 16.	Are your safety lancets made from materials or contain materials, lubricants, coating, or additives that do not adversely influence or affect the test results obtained when the lancet is used as intended?  If yes, provide the study or analysis providin g the proof. 17.	Do your lancets have markings that identify the product outside of the package? 18.	Are your safety lancets individually packaged? 19.	Are the expiration dates on the packaging for safety lancets easily visible on boxes, individual wrapping, and with longevity of greater than one year? 2. Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several   disciplines will evaluate the products, using a literature review process method, based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability. 1.	It is clearly labeled as a lancet device. 2.	Easy to use and requires minimal training. 3.	Have minimal or no noise on activation so as not to startle the patient or user. 4.

<DESC>On May 1, 2007, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences competitively awarded Contract No. HHSN291200775564C entitled Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB) to Research Triangle Institute.  The award was for a Phase I short-term reproductive toxicity study on a single generation of test animals to evaluate the specific capabilities of the awardee.  The award included an option to exercise Phase II of the study based upon the awardee's acceptable performance of Phase I.  
NIEHS intends to negotiate with Research Triangle Institute to expand the Phase I short-term reproductive toxicity study to include testing of three generations of test animals, thereby expanding the level of effort, cost, and period of performance of Phase I.   This expansion is necessary in order to adequately evaluate the capabilities of RTI in preparation for the Phase II studies.  The authority justifying this noncompetitive acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The additional work required is similar to work specified at the time of award and it requires an expansion of similar skills, disciplines, and expertise that are already specified in the contract.  RTI is considered to be the only contractor that can perform this specific Phase I study because it has successfully competed in full-and-open competition for the combined Phase I and Phase II components of the contract.  Performance of the Phase I component without Phase II, or vice versa, are unfeasible and would be considered unacceptable to the Government.  See Numbered Note 22 for further information.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Public Private Partnership

SAIC-Frederick is the prime contactor for the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-Frederick). NCI-Frederick is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center which conducts basic and translational research focused primarily on cancer and AIDS.

The Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL; http://ncl.cancer.gov/), SAIC-Frederick, Inc. at NCI-Frederick conducts preclinical characterization of nanomaterial intended for cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. In this role, NCL provides contracted support to the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer (http://nano.cancer.gov/index.asp) and the inter-agency collaboration between NCI, NIST and FDA to help transition promising nanotechnology concepts from academia, government and industry, to the clinic. Due to the complexity and variety of multifunctional nanomaterial platforms in the R&D pipeline, NCL seeks to leverage the expertise and experience in academia, industry and government agencies in accelerating the transition of these concepts to clinical trials.

NCL intends to pursue public-private partnerships for co-development of improved instrumentation and standard methods and protocols for characterization of nanomaterial intended for biomedical applications.  The physico-chemical, in vitro and in vivo characterization of nanomaterial under physiological conditions requires instrumentation having detection, resolution and throughput beyond current capabilities.  For example, development of techniques and automation for electron microscopy of nanoparticles in tissues will allow scientists to verify biodistribution and localization. Other anticipated joint research and development projects include advanced measurement techniques to determine the structure, polydispersity and batch-to-batch consistency of functionalized nanoparticles and the conformation and distribution of their ligands.  

The private partner(s) in any proposed public-private partnership expect to derive certain benefits.  Partners to these cost-sharing agreements would have access to nanomaterial R&D, emerging platforms for clinical application, supplementary characterization methods and nanobiology standard and protocol development, however, all rights to third-party nanomaterials available to NCL will remain with the third party providers.  NCL would gain access to instrumentation R&D, application expertise, training, instrumentation protocol and standard development.  It is the intent of NCL to go beyond current mechanisms for collaborations, for example material transfer agreements, to pursue innovative measures such as co-location of facilities and infrastructure -- while under a framework of an appropriate business model for the various aspects of the public private partnership.

The NCL through SAIC-Frederick is requesting responses to this Sources Sought Notice to include an Interest Statement, Capabilities Statement and Proposed Collaborative Research Proposals for evaluation by the SAIC-Frederick and NCL. Your responses should be brief (no more that two (2) pages in 12 point font) however, contain enough information to assess the validity of capabilities and any proposed collaborative efforts.

<DESC>This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this request for information (RFI) will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this a nnouncement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort . The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition se nsitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  Description:  The Government is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available products and technologies capable of providing enhanced visual recognition capabilities for operators of combat vehicles at a low unit price.  The intended vehicle platform for integration of this product capability is the HMMWV.  The government is primarily interested in products with technologically mature sensor systems that include day and night camera capabilities.  Additionally, responses provided should addres s industrys ability to commence high rate monthly production within 3 months from contract award leading to delivery and platform installation of 5034 systems on or before the end of calendar year 2008.  System Configuration:  The government envisions that FADS will be an improved follow on to the Driver Vision Enhancement Plus system currently being produced in limited quantities by DRS, Inc, FL under contract Number W15P7T-04-C-J202. FADS improvements include a separate sensor for an observer in the back of the vehicle with an associated video display. This sensor will have an adjustable focal length capability. Both users, driver and observer, will have the ability to employ electric pan and tilt controls. System Capabilities: It is envisioned that the FADS will operate in urban, rural, and off road terrains.  Additionally, the FADS will be used to detect activities which may indicate Improvised Explosive Device (IED) emplacement and /or employment. The syst em must be able to allow an observer to continuously scan threat areas around the vehicle from the ground level to roof tops of three story buildings to detect a human at ranges up to 500 meters using multiple fields of view.  The observer must be able to independently pan and tilt the sensor(s) which will be able to operate in both day and night conditions as well as degraded visibility conditions (smoke, fog, haze, rain, dust, etc).  Additionally, the FADS must be able to record activities associated with  IED emplacement or an attack on the vehicle for review at a later time.  The system must meet the most current version of MIL-STD-461, Electromagnetic Interference.  FADS components must be able to be removed and placed on another vehicle quickly in a tac tical environment without the need for special tools.   Power requirements must be supported by current onboard power generation equipment with a fully combat configured M1114 or M1151.  In the event said power requirements cannot be met, adequate power ge neration must be part of the FADS design itself Current System Specs: FADS system elements must as capable as currently fielded DVE and DVE Plus systems.  Specifications for the DVE Plus PTM with Quickset PTM in clude:  Weight: 15.5 pounds; Height: 13.25 inches; Width:  9.5 inches; Depth:  5.25 inches. For the FLIR Sensor:  Band 8-12 microns  long wave; Detector  640x480; NET:  less than or equal to 35milliKelvins; Cooling: Uncooled; Focal Length: 7mm (40 degrees) Other considerations:  The government is seeking low cost, non-developmental item/commercially available low cost solution for FADS.  The system must be operable by a skill level 1 military member. When considering price estimates respondents are requested  to address complete system unit cost including all components, training, delivery, maintenance and installation impacts based on use of combat configured M1114 or M1151. Interested sources are requested to provide complete descriptions of existing products or those that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above.  Industry responses must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that t heir system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or  any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness.  Additionally, industry responses are to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely im pact high rate production in an accelerated environment.  Any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments.  Industry r esponses should also submit their projected monthly production capabilities to include critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices assuming a notional 31 Dec 08 completion date for delivery of 5034 items. Responses to this RFI are due by 4:00pm on 13 September 2007.  Technical questions and industry responses are to be sent via email to Patrick Schertler at patrick.schertler@conus.army.mil.  All material submitted in response to this RFP must be unclassified.  Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing: 1.	Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets   2.	Technical and management approach for executing a FADS program to include a detailed design; procurement of subsystems and components and the integration of sensor components; rigorous contractor  test and integration data;  supporting technical documen tation; and, operational and sustainment considerations 3.	A cost estimate on a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to meet or exceed the notional requirements outlined above. 4.	A supporting program schedule that represents a low risk approach to meeting the objectives outlined above. 5.	An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk mitigation approaches. 6.	Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for Program, Technical and Cost points of contact information. The Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue to aid in the governme nts feasibility assessment. Additionally, the government may allow interested parties an opportunity to provide a demonstration of their FADS solution.  It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 8 hours, including installation and de-insta llation, and will take place at either at Fort Belvoir, VA and/or at Fort A.P. Hill, VA.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Cisco Products
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the ?brand name? Cisco router products to support existing Cisco hardware infrastructure that is installed and in production for the USPTO?s automated information systems (AISs).  This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing IDIQ contractors for Information Technology products within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   
Cisco was selected as the new Technical Reference Model standard for USPTO after a market survey and lab evaluation.
The Cisco family is a versatile platform and consists of the commercially available models that best meet the hybrid environments, security requirements, reliability and compatibility.  Since the existing routers are Cisco, compatibility is the most important reason to maintain the continuity of the network traffic and keeping this critical business running.  In addition, purchase of the similar hardware will reduce and/or share the cost of spare parts with other network project and save the maintenance cost by not maintaining different similar functioning products. Furthermore, the purchase of different hardware will require additional component, system, reliability and compatibility testing. These new tests will cost the project time and money while the current budget does not permit.. If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to connie.lum@uspto.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Mississippi Laboratories, located in Pascagoula, MS, intends to modify Purchase Order WC133F-07-SE-0221 for the rental of a dry storage trailer by adding four additional 12 month option periods which will extend the period of performance through September 30, 2011 with Transport International Pool, Inc., Wayne, PA based on the following reasons 1) The NMFS Mississippi Laboratories were demolished when hurricane Katrinia struck Pascagoula, MS in August of 2005.  NMFS acquired this trailer through competitive bid and has been utilizing this dry storage trailer to store documents and salvageable equipment while a new building is being constructed; 2) The existing Purchase Order was awarded from a competitive bid, but only allowed for occupation through September 30, 2007 and now the extension of the existing rental agreement is essential while a new building is being constructed; 3) The cost to vacate this trailer, move it off the property, procure a new trailer, move it onto the property, would be more costly to the Government then extending the lease through the addition of option periods; 4) This extension of this lease on the dry storage trailer is critical to NMFS Mississippi Laboratories operations in Pascagoula, MS.

The Government plans to negotiate with Transport International Pool, Inc for the continued rental of the dry storage trailer currently in its possession and onsite in Pascagoula, MS.  Inquiries regarding this requirement should be directed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  The applicable NAICS code is 532120.

<SUBJECT>X -- NOTICE OF INTENT FOR MODIFICATION OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE RENTAL OF 7 DOUBLE WIDE OFFICE TRAILERS BY ADDING ADDITIONAL OPTION PERIODS
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Mississippi Laboratories, located in Pascagoula, MS, intends to modify Purchase Order WC133F-05-SE-6585 for the rental of seven (7) double wide office trailers by adding two additional 12 month option periods which will extend the period of performance through October 16, 2011 with Resun Leasing Inc., Dulles VA based on the following reasons 1) The NMFS Mississippi Laboratories were demolished when hurricane Katrinia struck Pascagoula, MS in August of 2005.  NMFS acquired these trailers through competitive bid and has been utilizing these double wide office trailers Laboratory  and Office space while a new building is being constructed; 2) The existing Purchase Order was awarded from a competitive bid, but only allowed for occupation through October 16, 2007 and now the extension of the existing rental agreement is essential while a new building is being constructed; 3) NMFS has made a significant investment in the remodeling and preparation of these double wide office trailers so that it could be utilized as laboratory and office space.  The current facility has been outfitted with all the necessary laboratory equipment and supplies and the NMFS Mississippi Laboratories have been able to resume their mission.  The cost to vacate these trailers, move them off the property, procure a new facilities, move them onto the property, outfit it, and hookup all the utilities would be far more costly to the Government than extending the lease through the addition of option periods; 4) The extension of the current lease would also eliminate the disruption of employees and the programs they are working; 5) This extension of this lease on the seven double wide office trailers is critical to NMFS Mississippi Laboratories operations in Pascagoula, MS. 6) Extension is to be funded by FY2008 funds.

The Government plans to negotiate with Resun Leasing Inc. for the continued rental of seven (7) double wide office trailers currently in its possession and onsite in Pascagoula, MS.  Inquiries regarding this requirement should be directed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  The applicable NAICS code is 332311.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dynetics, Incorporated, Huntsville, Alabama, for a six (6) month extension to the current Dynetics Contract DASG60-99-D-0003.

This extension is required to maintain uninterrupted Sensor Processing, Exploitation, and Coordination support pending completion of a competitive aw ard currently underway.

The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved th rough competition of this short term effort.

All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at diann e.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision. LEGAL EFFECT OF QUOTATIONS (FAR 13.004) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract.  The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offers.  The supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered, by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.  When appropriated the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order in writing.

<DESC>SPECIFICATIONS
Below is the spec for Cutlass & Scabbard as compiled from USMC & USN swords, as well as historical precedence

1)	General: 
a)The Cutlass shall be of the 1860/1861 CPO design. 
b)All brass components and fittings must be 24K gold-plated to prevent tarnish. 
c)All metal work must be properly dressed prior to plating or final polishing such that it is substantially free of all casting, filing, and grinding marks and will not snag the Sailor's uniform. 
d)All smooth surfaces shall be polished to a bright finish. 
e)Total length of the cutlass will be  31.5" (+ or - ?") from end cap screw to blade tip. 
f)The cutlass and scabbard shall properly fit each other so that the cutlass enters the scabbard freely, but not loosely.

2)	Grip: 
a)The total length of the grip from guard plate/Ricasso juncture to the cap screw shall be 5-3/8" (+ or - 1/8"). 
b)The length of leather exposed on the grip shall be  3-3/16" (+ or - 1/8")on the top/spine side of the grip, and 4-3/16" (+ or - 1/8") on the bottom/cutting edge side of the grip.
c)The grip shall be of high quality matte black leather covering molded plastic.  There shall be a continuous gold-coated, twisted wire pair, or a "combination" of three continuous gold-coated twisted wire pairs, wound spirally on the surface of the grip forming 13 (+/- 1) evenly spaced bands.  A wooden form, properly turned, may be used as the base of the grip leather.
3)	Guard: 
a)The guard shall be full brass without USN cut-outs in the proper French-curve clamshell style permitting the proper execution of the manual of arms with the cutlass. 
b)The hilt and the guard spine shall be a continuously cast piece with a groove on the inner surface that accepts the guard and presents a relatively smooth surface free of edges and surfaces that can snag.  
c)The guard shall be free of sharp edges and sharp corners and shall be riveted to the hilt with 11 evenly spaced rivets.  The rivets shall have rounded heads and shall be free of sharp edges to 	prevent snagging on both sides of the rivets.  
d)The guard will have a maximum spacing from the center/spine line of the leather grip to the clamshell of  2-3/4" (+ or - 1/8")
e)The guard will have a distance of 2" (+ or - 1/8") from the bottom/cutting edge side of the leather grip to the rivet/finger guard edge of the guard.
f)The clamshell shall have a lip that flares away from the grip 3/16".
4)End Cap-Screw: 
a)The end screw shall be ? inch (+/- 1/16") in diameter with a single slot and shall not protrude more than 1/8" from the grip socket.  The end screw shall be plated in 24k gold. 
b)The end cap shall be made of brass and attached with a recessed screw in order to allow for replacement of components which become damaged (e.g., a dented guard). A pounded rivet or soldering may not be utilized as they do not meet this performance specification.
c)The end cap should extend 2-1/4" (+ or - 1/8") from the end cap screw over the leather of the grip on the spine side of the cutlass. It should taper back such that the cutting edge side meets the pommel at the finger guard/rivet spine.
5)Blade: 
a)The blade shall be drop-forged, machine-ground, or milled stainless steel and finished without blowholes, pocket marks, or other irregularities in the metal. The HRC Rockwell rating should be 48-52. 
b)The blade shall be 26 inches long (+/- 3/8"), single-edged with a rudimentary double edge within 5" of the point. 
c)The blade shall be  1-3/16" wide at the ricasso. 
d)A piece of white felt or white leather 1/8 +/- 1/32 inch shall be slotted to fit continuously around the blade against the hilt. 
e)The blade shall gradually taper to the tip according to the following dimensions: 
i)The width 1" from the tip of the blade shall be ?"(+ or- 1/16").
ii)The width of the blade 3-1/2" from the tip shall be 7/8" (+ or - 1/16").
iii)The width of the blade 6" from the tip shall be 1"(+or-1/16").
f)The blade shall have a tang running to the end of the cutlass grip where it is threaded to secure the cap screw. The cap screw shall have a 1/16" slot to permit disassembly for replacement of damaged components.
g)The thickness of the blade shall be 3/16" at the ricasso/guard juncture. It will gradually taper to a thickness at the tip of 1/32".
h)The Fuller groove shall be 15-1/2" long (+ or - 1/2"). Both sides of the blade shall have the groove. It shall leave 1/4" of steel at the cutting edge of the blade and 1/8" of full metal for the spine of the blade. It shall start 2.5" (+ or - 1/2") from the ricasso/guard juncture.
i)The taper of the cutting edge shall begin 2.5" (+ or - 1/2") from the ricasso/guard juncture. The cutting edge will run to the tip of the blade.
j)The cutting edge shall be flat ground equally to both sides of the blade remaining unsharpened and thus suitable for use as a ceremonial arm.
k)The curvature of the blade shall equal 7/10" (+ or - 1/8") away from a straight line chord between the tip and ricasso at the point 11" from the ricasso/guard juncture.
l)The blade shall be deeply acid etched such that it catches a fingernail when drug across the etch, with the marking "U.S.N." in ?" letters 1-3/16" above the hilt/guard at the ricasso. The tops of the letters are towards the blade tip. This shall be on the obverse/starboard/right side of the cutlass blade.
m)The maker's mark and country of origin shall be acid etched in a uniform manner. It is to be etched into the blade on the port/left/reverse side of the cutlass blade. The etch should not be less than ? inch from the hilt and with letters measuring not less than 1/32 inch in height and with each line separated by a minimum of 1/32 inch.  The manufacturer's mark will denote the country where the majority of the physical manufacturing occurred.
6)	Scabbard:  
a)The scabbard body shall be made of sheet metal 0.030 to 0.065 inch thick, rolled, formed and welded, or of seamless steel tubing 0.030 to 0.065 inch thick.  The performance objective is to keep the scabbard leather from breaking, bending, or sagging in general use. The scabbard shall be constructed in length and inside dimension as necessary to provide proper fit for the cutlass.
b)The scabbard shall be 1-1/2" wide and ?" thick. Its curvature will match that of the cutlass blade.
c)The mouth fitting shall be a full-cast piece, that is slotted and covers the mouth to protect the leather of the scabbard when executing "return cutlass" as all other military service pieces specify. 
d)The mouth fitting shall run  2-5/16" (+ or - 1/4") down the scabbard in length. Its width shall be 1-13/16" (+ or - 1/8"). The thickness shall be 7/8" (+ or - 1/16").
e)The stud on the scabbard mouth fitting will center on the side of the fitting, 1-1/8" (+ or - 1/8") below the lip of the fitting measured to the center of the stud.
f)The scabbard mouth fitting shall be attached to the scabbard by one recessed screw on the side opposite of the stud (inboard side).
g)The mouth fitting and the drag/tip of the scabbard shall show no seam in the metal work.
h)High quality calfskin leather of  2.5 oz in thickness must be used to cover the scabbard. The leather shall be full-grain and smooth-finished.  The leather shall be affixed to the scabbard body with adhesive that provides a secure and permanent bond between the leather covering and the metal of the scabbard without undesirable effects upon either.  The use of polyurethane is acceptable. The finish shall be in the color of matte black. The seam shall be difficult to discern when held at arm's length. The leather covering shall adhere to the scabbard tightly, without ripples or bubbles. Rivets may not be used to fasten the leather.
i)The scabbard drag fitting shall be attached to the scabbard with a recessed screw on the inboard side of the scabbard. The tip of the drag fitting shall have a ball 3/8" in diameter at the tip.
j)The drag shall be  5-1/8" long.
k)The scabbard inserts shall be two pieces of 0.032 +/- 0.003 inch thick sulfur-free fiberboard. The fiber sheet shall be un-dyed and free of all sulfur compounds or compounds capable of oxidation to sulfuric acid.  The scabbard inserts shall be placed inside the scabbard extending along the sides from the hilt to within 3 inches (+/- 1/2 inch) of the toe of the scabbard.
7)	Sword Bag:
a)The finished cotton cloth shall be vat dyed gray, silver, or dark blue.  The cloth shall be constructed of flannelette of plain weave, with a thread count of  44 +/- 2 warp and 36 +/- 2 filling threads per inch.

<SUBJECT>R -- Facilitation for U.S. Longline Bycatch Reduction Assessment and Planning Workshop

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NFFK-7-19176 is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The goal of the workshop is to fully assemble, review and discuss the results of all U.S. longline bycatch reduction efforts to date, fully evaluate the available information on the effects of circle hooks on bycatch species (sea turtles, marine mammals, seabirds, billfish and sharks) and target catch, identify gaps in our knowledge and develop an Agency plan to best direct our domestic and international longline bycatch reduction efforts from here.  Longline bycatch reduction is an extremely multi-faceted and complicated subject.  Since participants will have their own respective areas of expertise and interest, the workshop could result in unfocused and nonproductive discussion.  Facilitation is required to guide and synthesize discussions and to ensure that participants remain focused on particular agenda items and that workshop objectives are achieved.  Contractors must have extensive expertise in facilitating workshops that focus on bycatch in longline fisheries, particularly sea turtle bycatch.  Contractors must have proven experience developing strategic plans for marine resources programs.  The contractor will provide support for:  1)  Review of agenda and related supporting materials in consultation with NMFS Office of Protected Resources (OPR) staff and the Steering Committee as appropriate; 2) Work with OPR to focus facilitation strategy; 3) Work with OPR to develop and prepare facilitated workshop activities; 4) Contribute to ongoing workshop coordination conducted by OPR; 5) Organize pre-workshop meeting with OPR; 6) Conduct workshop facilitation; 7) Develop draft report that summarizes workshop discussions, strategic planning exercises, priorities identified, and follow up actions; and 8) Provide Draft Report for NMFS review/comment and finalize workshop report.  Deliverables: The contractor will provide one senior facilitator and one associate facilitator - both with experience in longline bycatch reduction for multiple species groups (e.g., sea turtle, seabird, marine mammal) - to assist with meeting preparation and finalizing the workshop agenda prior to September 1, 2007.  The contractor will convene a pre-workshop meeting of NMFS staff and key steering committee members on September 17 and facilitate the workshop September 18-20.  The contractor will develop a final workshop report by December 31, 2007.  Period of Performance: July 1 - December 31, 2007.  The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm fixed price.  The award shall be made on a best value basis.  Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price.  The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Outstanding (O) - Conspicuously striking in eminence; Good (G) - Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Adequate (A) - Reasonably sufficient and suitable; Marginal (M) - Minimally suitable at the lower limit.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to RFQ 0193132.  The purpose of this amendment is to post responses to questions received regarding this RFQ.  Questions and responses are provided below:


1. The data will be captured at our location if lower cost?

A: Data will be captured at the contractors location.

2. Is there any benefit to doing the capture in Quantico Va., or in other actual locations?

A: This request for quotes is specifically for optical (not gyroscopic or mechanical) motion capture. The actual locations in Quantico, VA are buildings with solid, opaque walls that would occlude the line-of-sight of optical motion-capture cameras. Therefore, using the actual locations is not feasible. 

3. Is there any benefit to doing parts of the capture outdoors?

A: No. The motions to be captured are all interior scenes (straight stairway, commercial stairway, hallways). There is no need to capture outdoors.

4. The time lists are in seconds of data? 1 person at 160 seconds, 2 persons at 1110 seconds representing 2220 seconds of data and 3 persons at 480 seconds representing 1440 seconds of data for a total of 3820 seconds of data?

A: That is correct. All the times are given in character-seconds, not scene-seconds.

5. Usually several takes are done of each sequence and only the 
preferred takes are cleaned up. Since our system automatically cleans up the data, is there an achieved cost benefit for having all of the takes cleaned? This would increase the effective number of seconds by a factor of 4 or more at no additional charge.

A: No. The takes that are chosen for clean-up will be the takes where the motions were tactically correct. There is no benefit to receiving motion data from the incorrect takes.

6. Are there any dangerous stunts such as falling off the stairs or any motions requiring special liability insurance?

A: No. As long as the sets are sturdy and constructed properly by the contractor, we do not anticipate anyone falling off the stairs.

7. Is Autodesk Motion Builder suitable for real time data preview? If so, does the animation team have a copy or should we include the $4,200 cost in the bid?

A: The animation team does not expect to have to provide the contractor with any software that is necessary to meet the requirements of the contract. The contractor should have sufficient resources in-house to display a real-time preview of the animation while the motions are being captured.

8. Any preferred format for the Video/Sound Reference? Tape? AVI file?

A: The preferred format for the video/sound reference is a separate WMV file for each take of the animation (high quality, 640x480 resolution or better, 2MB/sec data rate).

9. Is a sample list of intended motions available?

A: Yes, the list is available upon request.

10. Would the FBI desire a copy of the client data preview and selection software for review?

A: Yes, if they are available.

11. Would the FBI desire a sample of data?

A: Yes, in .csm format, if one is available.

12. Would sample characters and scenes / sets be provided to use in the real time preview? If so what is the typical data file size?

A: Three character models, rigged to the standard character studio biped using the Skin modifier will be provided in .max files for the real-time preview.  Three building models (the "sets") will be provided as .max files. The character models are approximately 5,500 triangles using .dds format texture files totaling 16MB in size on disk.  The townhouse model with straight stairs is 2,488 triangles. The commercial stairs model is 1,749 triangles.

13. Usually during shoots, new ideas are collected and if time is available captured. Is there a benefit to including this in the rate?

A: The contractor should bid based on the number of character seconds given in the request for quote.

14. How many frames per second do they want the output data if captured at 120 to 480 hertz? Usually this is 30 hertz and down sampled from 480.

A: 30 frames per second is the desired output data rate.

15.  Would the Government like past performance references:

A: Yes, if available.

3.	Support a capture volume of at least 20 feet wide, 20 feet long and 20 feet tall. 
4.	Support the simultaneous capture of at least 3 actors on the same stage. 
5.	Be capable of tracking rigid props at the same time as human motion. 
6.	Be capable of building sets for the motions to be captured on, to include a straight staircase with a 10 foot by 10 foot platform at the top capable of supporting the weight of 3 average adult males and a commercial stairway (flight of stairs, landing, another flight of stairs going the other way) capable of supporting the weight of 3 average adult males. 
7.	Be capable of displaying a real-time 3D render of the characters and environment model on-screen in the studio as the motions are being captured, to enable the animation director to verify that the motions are correct. 
8.	Provide a single-angle digital video reference of the capture session with audio. 
9.	Provide client software that allows the government customer to preview all the captured data and choose the starting and stopping points in the data stream for clean-up and post-processing. 
10.	Provide post-processing data clean-up services for all motion capture data. 
11.	Deliver a useable final product in 3ds Max Character Studio format (.csm files) that can be applied to characters and modified in Autodesk's 3D Studio Max application. 
12.	Provide a turn-around time of less than 2 months from motion capture date to final delivery of output files.

<DESC>Contracting Officer is Clementine Caudle-Wright at Clementine.caudle-wr@dot.gov.  

This amendment clarifies that this is a FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  It is NOT restricted to GSA Schedule holders.  

This posting on FBO takes precedence over the document posted on STB website. 

The preferred method for submitting proposals is via e-mail.  Proposals shall be transmitted no later than 9:00 a.m., September 4, 2007.   All offerors are cautioned to allow time to exercise alternative methods for submitting proposals to meet the September 4, 2007, 9:00 a.m. submission time.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for transmission problems and errors.   ALL OTHER PROPOSAL submissions shall be delivered to and be in the possession of the Contracting Officer at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 20590 no later than September 4, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. and shall consist of FIVE (5) hard copies of the total proposal package that include the cost and technical proposals.   See the solicitation in reference to proposal preparation.  Due to high security of Government buildings, the offeror is cautioned to contact the Contracting Officer to arrange delivery instructions for hard copy submissions.  

QUESTION:  While reviewing the complete request for proposal posted at http://www.stb.dot.gov, I noticed that GSA number is requested as part of the Cost Proposal.  Our firm does not have a GSA number.  Will this result in our proposal being labeled as "non-responsive"?    RESPONSE:  This is a FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  No GSA Schedule Number is required.

QUESTION:  There is a reference to a due date of August 7 with the solicitation documentation.  Please confirm that the due date is September 4, 2007.  RESPONSE:  Proposals are due on September 4, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. CONTRACTING OFFICER e-mail address is Clementine.caudle-wr@dot.gov

Contractor  Question for RFP Number  TIRSE-07-R-00004



1. The Request for Proposal Number TIRSE-07-R-00004 is 100% Small Business Set-a-side.


2.  Information Mapping? is a trademarked method to write and structure information. The method has been around for more than 25 years and is one of the major influences on technical writing. 

Our design center have been using this method for our technical writing since the early 90's.  The software can be purchased and must be compatible with Microsoft Word 2003 and higher although we do not use the new Vista.  The vendor would be responsible for purchasing the software at no expense to the Government.  Most but not all of our current materials are already in this format.

4.  FAR 52.212-3, hard copy or up to date ORCA will be accepted.

5.  Yes, bidder must be a licensed Information Mapping user before contract award.

6.  A.5 Pickup and Delivery:

When the contractor delivers to the project manager, is it usually the 3 CD?s or will the contractor be required to ship hard copies?  
Normally we will accept the 3 CD delivered.  Occasionally we will request a hard copy. 

If hard copies are required, how many and how large? 
1 copy, size depends on the size of the project.

7.  Unfortunately the volume cannot be estimated, because it is based on each business unit requirements and other factors.

The Contractor is responsible for initial quality control of the proof copies prior to submission to PM and COTR. The COTR and PM will collaborate on recommended changes, and prior to return to CGD, will receive Client approval. All files that are a part of the project will be scanned by the contractor, using the spell checker extension/utility (including vector, rasterized and text files layers). This includes files not created by the contractor, but is a part of the final project. This will be performed at least twice before creation of Acrobat PDF Proof file.  The sequence of text, i.e. chapters/headers, page numbers and table of contents, etc, are to be created and proofed prior to final file submission to the PM and COTR. Once created, a final will be emailed to the COTR and PM for review, upon approval the PM will email the PDF version to the Client for their approval. The client has 4 business days to review the proposed first designs. A second design submission will have 3 business days for review. Minor changes must be reviewed within 2 business days. Any delay in review will also delay the submission of the job for reproduction by that same amount. Use the following Web Site if the file site exceeds 3 megabytes:  http://www.sendthisfile.com/ It is recommended that everyone associated with the contract register them selves for free access at the start of the contract. When a file is sent to the recipient, a notification is automatically generated, notifying them that a file has been sent. If a file cannot be opened, contact the sender in a timely manner. Failure to do so may delay the delivery date of entire print project.  Once Client approval has been completed, the contractor shall deliver a finished Acrobat Press Ready-PDF file proof to the contract printer for initial development of digital proof color copies. A paper copy of the PDF file will also be made a part of the submission to the printer. These include files not created by the contractor, but are a part of the final project.  The Contract Printer will complete the 2 digital proofs, and deliver one each, to the COTR, and PM. They will review the proofs and the PM will get Client approval for printing and delivery.  3.	Changes to file: Any changes requested by the COTR or PM that are a modification to the originally submitted text file may require additional funding as a part of the design and layout process. The CGD will furnish estimated costs to the COTR who will in turn notify the PM. This will be based on the below hourly rate (see number 13). The PM must approve all additional charges and notify the COTR before work can be authorized. Additional production time may be required and will be estimated by the contractor and furnished to the COTR for acceptability. If a change is required after the contract printer has created digital proof, plate charges and printer pre-press production charges will be incurred. It is the intent of the Client, PM and COTR to not require major changes to the digital proof. If major changes are required, a new digital proof will need to be developed. Major changes to the digital proofs will require additional funding and may require a new production schedule for printing. In the event that the requested changes delay the project due date/deadlines, the COTR and PM will notify the contract printer in writing before major changes are authorized. 4.	Acrobat PDF File for WEB Site A copy of the final PDF files must be submitted to the PM by the CGR for use on the VA WEB site. If an update to the file occurs at the contract printer, the printer will be responsible to create the final PDF version and email submission to the PM and COTR. Brochure and poster must be tagged for 508 compliancy. 5.	Estimated Print Cost  The contractor shall inform the COTR of the image count, enabling the contract printer to establish a firm estimated reproduction cost. The information will be forwarded to the PM to confirm that allocated funding levels are adequate. 6.	Inks -Paper Stock:  Pantone /Process Coated inks will be specified using a swatch sample and sent to the contract printer by the contractor for reproduction color accuracy. The Pantone chip samples must not be more then two years old from date of purchase, and properly stored in order to be accurate as color ink guide. The Poster will be reproduced in Process color inks (CMYK), with a varnish applied on the sticker and poster. Any change to the stock must fall within the GPO paper stock and or contract guidelines and be approved by the PM through the COTR.  7.	Backup of native project files: The PM and COTR will make a copy of the native program file as a backup, in the event of file loss, or computer system file corruption, prior to forwarding the file to the contractor. 8.	Completed files: The contractor shall supply the completed files on CD/DVD and use a priority overnight mailing method when sending the completed files to the GPO Chicago office. Backup of all files must be created and retained by the contractor until a working copy has been given to the COTR. The approved and completed files are the property of the VA, and will be delivered to the COTR for subsequent delivery to the PM. 9.	Shipping Information: Shipping distribution labels will be provided and approved by the PM. The labels must be proofed and validated as current, prior to being sent to the COTR/CGD and or printer by the PM.  The labels should be sent to the contract printer no later then the date of the approved /signed proof. The sub contractor toolkit provider address must be furnished at that time.  All items to be stored by the VA Hines Distribution Center, will require a Box ID, which must be provided by the PM to the COTR/printer.
