<RESPDATE>081406
<ARCHDATE>08012007
<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Region Mineral Resources Team (CR-MRT) has a requirement for a large spot capable laser ablation system to be utilized on the PerkinElmer ELAN 6000 ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer) and the PerkinElmer ELAN DRC-e ICP-MS. This is a mission critical piece of equipment for the continued advancement of methods development and applications central to the goals of the team. This system is differentiated from other systems already operated in the laser ablation laboratory (CR- MR T) in that it will have the capability of spot sizes up to 10 times larger than conventional laser ablation systems (up to 1200 J.Ull vs. 120 to 200 J.Ull). These larger spot sizes will allow direct determination of trace elements in solids down to concentrations less 1 part per billion. The system must have the capability to be run in a routine, fully- automated fashion on the existing USGS owned PerkinElmer ELAN ICP-MS systems and other modem ICP-MS instrumentation available on the market today. The large spot capable laser ablation system will be used for studying trace elements in bulk powders of geological materials (rocks, ore, coal and others). The system will deliver improved detections limits for these materials. In some cases the detection limits possible by a large spot capable laser ablation may rival detection limits by conventional methods and a large spot capable system is the only type of laser ablation system with such capabilities. The laser ablation system needs to meet the following requirements: I) Be a fully enclosed Class 1 laser system 2) Deliver laser pulses in excess of 20 mJ of 266 nm from a 300 mJ IR laser 3) Deliver aperture imaged spots up to 700 pm in diameter with defocused spots up to 1200 pm and spot size range down to less than 50 pm 4) Include a integrated software package with video imaging from a frame grabber 5) Be capable of closed contact or TTL triggering with all brands of ICP-MS systems available on the market today. Based on information available at this time and in accordance with 41.U.S.C. 253© (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies/services specified as a sole source from: New WaveResearch, Inc., 48660 Kato Road, Fremont, CA 94539, the manufacturer of Universal Platform UP266 MACRO System, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. A affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Sin no solicitation document exist, request for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.This requirement will only be process to the point of award, funds are currently not available for this requirement.

<SOLNBR>06WRSS0020
<RESPDATE>081606
<ARCHDATE>08012007
<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) has a need for a qualified contractor to provide assistance in hazard response and database activities related to the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, based at CVO.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract is contemplated; individual task orders will be issued as needs arise that identify specific tasks to be performed within the general scope of this contract, as described below.  The USGS contemplates a contract with a four-year ordering period, which may or may not include the use of option years. The Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) is a cooperative effort, jointly funded and authorized by the USGS Volcano Hazards Program and USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), and physically headquartered at CVO in Vancouver, WA.  VDAP's mission is to prevent volcanic crises from becoming volcanic disasters.  This mission is accomplished by: 1) maintaining a team of rapid responders and a cache of volcano monitoring equipment, and responding to episodes of volcanic unrest anywhere in the world at short notice; 2) cooperative work with counterpart agencies in developing nations to enhance volcano monitoring capabilities, understanding and public awareness of volcanic hazards, and through development of effective hazard mitigation strategies.  There is a healthy relationship between scientists at CVO and within VDAP as missions are similar.  Scientists at the CVO are responsible for monitoring volcanic unrest in the Cascades and issuing volcano hazards advisories.  CVO is currently leading the USGS response to the ongoing eruption of Mount St. Helens.  A qualified contractor's assistance is needed for the development of an international database of volcanic unrest, (World Organization of Volcano Observatories Database, WOVOdat) to be used as a predictive tool in forecasting eruptive behavior at hazardous volcanoes.  Assistance is also needed for crisis response activities at other international volcanoes (e.g., at Merapi volcano, Indonesia and Mayon volcano, Philippines).     The contractor will be based in the Philippines, and will serve as a rapid responder for VDAP in the SE Asia/Pacific region.  The contractor will prepare written updates and situation reports and represent VDAP on site as needed during and following eruptions and periods of volcanic unrest.  The contractor will also lead an international effort to develop a database on the characteristics of volcanic hazards during past eruptions at volcanoes worldwide.  The database will be used by VDAP to forecast future eruptive behavior, hazards and risk. On a task-by-task basis, the contractor will:  1) assist VDAP teams in responding to volcanic unrest and crises as needed, 2) assist VDAP in the development of an international database of volcanic unrest (WOVOdat) including coordination with international partners, contributors, and potential donors, 3) Prepare briefing documents, situation reports, and reports on WOVOdat. To fulfill this need, the USGS intends to enter into sole-source negotiations with Chris Newhall, of Seattle, WA.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.   For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. Numbered Note 26 applies.  NAICS 541990.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Washington, DC that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 74,698 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space to be available by October 17, 2006. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 64,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet. The lease term requirement is for three (additionally the Government seeks five year quotations for informational purpose only). The delineated area is the Central Employment Area.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

<RESPDATE>081106
<ARCHDATE>09102006
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>The purpose of this Public Announcement is to provide industry information regarding post FAA Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) industry day activities and to publish future plans.  This is the 4th ADS-B Public Announcement. An ADS-B Industry Day was held at FAA headquarters on June 19, 2006.  Approximately 60 companies were represented.  Following industry day, one-on-one discussions were held with individual vendors.  The Surveillance and Broadcast Services Program Office appreciates the time industry spent during Industry day and subsequent discussions.  Useful and substantive information was obtained.  In addition, the FAA became aware of additional industry capabilities.     The Industry Day briefings and associated material is posted at  http://www.ads-b.gov.  During discussions, several companies asked if they could be provided the software currently used under the Capstone Project in the Alaskan Region and the East Coast Broadcast Services systems.   The software was developed by MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) acting on behalf of FAA as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center.   The software resides in a package entitled "Broadcast Services Capstone Communications and Control System (CCCS)."    There are three primary subsystems within CCCS:  a Core Switch Unit (CSU); a Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) server; and a Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B) server.   A description of the software is included in Attachment A hereto.      Version 2.0-Beta of the software is available for analysis upon request.  Requestors must sign and return to MITRE a license agreement identified as Attachment B hereto.  Vendors are advised that the software is provided for information purposes only and serves as a data point for vendors to understand the approach taken.  The prototype ground stations, which the software is a part of, never reached the point of an "in service Decision (ISD) within FAA.  The FAA does not warrant the use of the software in any resulting Broadcast Services contract and will not be responsible for any deficiencies associated therewith if a vendor should choose to utilize the software.      A second ADS-B Industry Day is planned for August 28, 2006.  The Agenda will include presentations by users of Broadcast Services.  Tentative confirmed users include:  1) The Air Transport Association (ATA); 2) The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA); 3) Aviation Communication & Surveillance Systems (ACSS); and 4) Rockwell Collins.  Other speakers may be added.    In addition, MITRE Corporation will discuss the CCCS software.   The planned starting time is 9:00 A.M.  The address is: Bessie Coleman Conference room. Second Floor FAA Headquarters 800 Independence Avenue S.W. Washington, D.C. 20591 Vendors without FAA identification should plan adequate time to process through security.  Vendors without appropriate FAA identification will need to register their laptop computers with the security staff.    In the days subsequent to the August 28 Industry Day, vendors will be given the opportunity to attend CCCS briefings at the MITRE facility located in McLean, VA in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of the CCCS software.  At that time, vendors will also be able to inspect a prototype ADS-B ground station.  MITRE attendees will be separated into groups containing a maximum of 10 people.  The vendor representatives attending the MITRE briefings should be knowledgeable of software architecture and design processes.  ALL ATTENDEES TO MITRE MUST BE U.S. CITIZENS.  Attachment C hereto contains directions to the MITRE facility.     Vendors may make requests for attendance at the August 28 Industry Day, receipt of the CCCS software, and appointments for the MITRE facility software briefing through:  Ms. Amy Durik Communications Lead 202-385-8394 (Desk) E:Mail:  Amy.CTR.Durik@faa.gov Signed license agreements for the software along with a return mailing address, point of contact and phone number should be mailed directly to:   The MITRE Corporation Attn:  Gerard Eldering Mail Stop N680 7515 Colshire Drive McLean, VA 22102-7508 Prior FAA ADS-B Public Announcements may be accessed at:  http://www.faa.gov, about FAA, business opportunities, contract opportunities, archived, keyword ADS=B.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a one year extension to the Departmentâ€™s actuarial contract with AON Consulting, Inc. under FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source.   The AON Consulting contract was awarded on September 1, 2002 and is scheduled to be completed on August 31, 2007 under contract number DE-AM01-02ME11800. The DOE is in the process of authorizing work that will exceed the remaining term of the contract.  Due to the critical need to insure continuity through completion of these work assignments, the DOE intends on extending the present contract 12 months through August 31, 2008. The work areas that AON Consulting, Inc. is responsible to perform include assistance to the DOE in the management and oversight of DOEâ€™s contractor human resource management programs.  AON Consulting, Inc. provides pension analysis, actuarial, employee compensation, welfare benefits, risk management and insurance technical and analytical support services.  The end products provided by AON Consulting, Inc. supports DOE policy analysis and facility management contract development related to evaluation of the effectiveness, value and cost of current and proposed DOE contractor compensation benefits and pension programs.  The one year value of this effort is estimated to be $850,000. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this modification is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements. AON has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel, technical skill and training, who are familiar with the program and requirements, and who are available to provide services pending the award of a competitive follow-on contract. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within thirty (30) days of this notice to: Mr. Craig Frame, MA-641.2, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20585, or via e-mail to craig.frame@hq.doe.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541612. ***See Numbered Note 22. Commercial firms who believe they have a superior solution to DOEâ€™s proposed extension to the AON Consulting, Inc. contract must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer. The written response must include a general technical proposal for performing the services mentioned in this announcement, past performance client information for similar work, resumes of individuals who would be potentially assigned to the work and a rational why the your firmâ€™s solution would be in the Governmentâ€™s best interest.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service[ ], has a need for Subject Indexing as specified below:

A.	General Requirements

1.	The contractor shall provide all the necessary expertise, facilities, supplies, reference materials, and equipment for concept indexing research and education project summaries contained in the Current Research Information System (CRIS) database.

2.	The contractor shall provide a microcomputer capable of connecting to the CRIS database through the Internet and compatible with the application software provided by the government.

3.	The contractor shall select indexing terms for project summaries provided by the government accessed via the Internet. The number of records to be indexed under this contract will range from 4,800 to 7,200 per year.

4.	The contractor shall be directly responsible for all work required by this contract. The contractor shall provide adequate supervision of the work which contractor employees are performing to ensure that it is complete, satisfactory, and in accordance with the terms of this contract.

The government will not exercise any direct supervision or control over contractor employees performing services under this contract. They shall be accountable solely to the contractor, who in turn, shall be accountable to the government.

B.	Specific Requirements

1.	The contractor shall assign indexing terms to each project summary provided by the government in batches consisting of three hundred (300) to four hundred and fifty (450) documents.

2.

(See Enclosure 3, Indexing Procedures, and Indexing CRIS Projects Using STAR Client, provided by the government at contract start, for details of the indexing process.)

4.	The contractor shall create and/or select new, provisional indexing terms that are not in the current vocabulary file when, in the judgment of the contractor, the term:

•	will enhance retrieval of the project,
•	is relevant to the subject of the project, and
•	no other existing term or combination of existing terms will suffice as an index entry.

5.	The contractor shall enter the indexing terms over the contractor’s Internet connection into a computer transaction file using VPN client and STAR Client software provided by the government. (See Enclosure 4, Sample STAR Client Screen Prints.) The records to be indexed will be made available to the contractor for indexing on a periodic basis.


Government-Furnished Items

The government will furnish the following:

C.	At contract start, one (1) copy of the VPN client software to connect to the Agency’s network, one (1) copy of the STAR Client software to access the application, and one (1) copy of the instructions for installing the software.

D.	Within two (2) weeks from contract start, the government shall provide indexing training. One (1) indexing trai¬ning session of up to two (2) days in length will be conducted at the CRIS site. Training will be provided for up to five (5) person¬nel and will cover the following:

6.	Indexing exercises.

E.	Following review of each completed batch of indexing records, the government will notify the contractor by e-mail of its acceptance or rejection of the batch and any proposed new indexing terms.


Deliverables and Reporting Requirements

F.	Contractor Deliverables

The contractor shall provide the government with the follow¬ing:

1.	For each batch of indexed projects, one (1) e-mail notification to the government that the latest batch of indexing records has been completed. The notification shall include a list of proposed new terms and shall identify the records on which they appear.

G.	Delivery Schedule

4.	At contract start, or following indexing training, if needed, the government shall provide the contractor with access to the first batch of project summaries to be indexed. The batch will consist of four hundred and fifty projects in a transaction file accessed via the Internet.

		2.	The contractor shall complete indexing of the first batch of records and notify the government by e-mail within three (3) weeks of receiving access to the records.

		3.	The remaining project summaries, in batches ranging from three hundred (300) to four hundred fifty 450 records, shall be made available to the contractor for processing at three (3) week intervals during the contract period. Any deviations from the schedule must be approved in advance by the COR.

H.	Delivery Dates

Delivery under this procurement is defined as the date deliv¬erables are post¬marked by the U.S. Postal Service, if mailed, or if hand-carried, the date of actual exchange of deliver¬ables be¬tween the contractor and the government. Electronic records are considered delivered when an e-mail notification has been sent.	


V.	Performance Standards and Quality Control

A.	Government Review of Completed Work
 

The government (COR or another assigned specialist) shall review all indexing performed by the contractor for accept¬ability. The following factors shall be included in the review crite¬ria for indexing:

1.	Appropriateness of index terms for retrieval of the project

2.	Relevancy and technical accuracy of index terms

3.	Adherence to CRIS indexing conventions

		4.	Depth and breadth of indexing

5.	Spelling (of proposed new terms)

The government, at its option, may request correction or modi¬fica¬tion of one or more indexed projects by the contractor if it is determined by the reviewer that contractor indexing is deficient as measured by one or more of the following criteria:

1.	If more than one (1) indexing term per every ten (10) projects is consid¬ered to be any of the following:

a.	Inappropriate for retrieval
b.	Irrelevant
c.	Technically inaccurate

2.	If more than one (1) project out of every ten (10) pro¬jects is under-in¬dexed; i.e., indexing in which one or more major subject concepts in a project or one or more specific organisms, practices, systems, proce¬dures, or similar attributes which are central to the work are not repre¬sented in the indexing.

In the event the government determines that indexing is deficient, all deficiencies shall be identified by the government in an e-mail notification to the contractor. The records to be corrected or modified will be available for access by the contractor on the indexing transaction file.

For all projects returned for indexing deficiencies, the contractor shall make the required corrections and notify the government by e-mail when all corrections have been completed.

B.	Completion of Indexing

A project indexed by the contractor shall not be considered to have been satis¬factorily com¬pleted until all indexing on the project has been accepted by the gov¬ernment.

The gov¬ernment shall notify the contractor that pro¬jects were selected for re-indexing or modifi¬cation/correc¬tion within three (3) weeks of receipt by the government of the origi¬nally indexed projects.

All re-indexing, modification, and/or correction shall take precedence over any original in¬dex¬ing which may be in prog¬ress.  No new indexing batches shall be submitted until all re-indexing or corrections have been completed.

The contractor shall bill the government only once for each project indexed and accepted, re¬gardless of the number of times a project is returned for re-indexing or modifica¬tion/correc¬tion.
 
VI.	Reporting Requirements

The contractor shall submit a progress report at least semi-annually covering work accomplished during that period of the contract performance. Delivery may be by mail, fax, or as an e-mail attachment. The progress report shall be brief and factual and shall be prepared in accordance with the following format:

A.	A cover page containing:

1.	Contract number and title;

2.	Type of report, sequence number of report, and period of performance being reported; and

3.	Contractor’s name and address.

<CONTACT>Tom Woolpert, Contract Support, 781-377-6624; Tom Leeds, Contracting Officer, 781-377-5612
<DESC>Electronic Systems Center, 853d Electronic Systems Group, Contracting Division gives notice of a pending contract action to modify the AFTERPS-R/Global Procedures Designer (GPD) contract sole-source to Canadian Commercial Corporation and Subcontractor MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) to add work, that is, increase ceiling prices of five annual service agreement contract line items by approximately $9M, whereas current value is approximately $3M.  This proposed contracting action is subject to approval of a justification for other than full and open competition (requiring this notice).  On 11 July 2006, the AFTERPS-R program achieved Full Operational Capability with the completion and delivery of the Release C version of the GPD software, effectively transitioning the AFTERPS-R program from development to sustainment and operations.  The delivered software will be sustained via the five Annual Service Agreement (ASA) option CLINs on Contract F19628-02-C-0012, each having a 12 month period of performance.  The ceiling price increases are based on the most recent POM which was reviewed by Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) (the program customer) and submitted by this program office in April 2006, with 20% in additional funding for unforeseen or unforecasted requirements which may arise.  The increases were not a result of contractor inputs, but they will be required to agree to the ceiling increases via execution of a supplemental agreement to the contract.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Rockville, Maryland, that will be expiring January 1, 2007.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 10,005 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 8,700 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for 5 years.  The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2006.  The delineated area is:

North: Lincoln Avenue
South: Veirs Mill Road	
East: 1st Street
West: Hungerford Drive

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move cost, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc. Due to security requirements, the offered space cannot be located on the first floor or the top floor of the premises.

Please send expressions of interest to:

Joe Judge

Fax: 301-214-1145
Email: joe.judge@staubach.com

Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 PM on August  16, 2006, and must include the following information:
- Building name and address
- Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
- ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.
- Date of space availability.
- Method of rentable space measurement.
- Building Ownership Information.
- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost – include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
- List of building services provided.

The Government's decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with The Regent of the University of Michigan, 3003 South State Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109 for project entitled “Statistical Genetics Analyses of Data from the SardiNIA Project”.   The contractor will ensure that the genetic mapping programs can merge two types of data on single-nucleotide polymorphism from the population cohort under study to optimize the yield of genetic information.  The program will operate in conjunction with measures to verify the quality and integrity of the genetic data.  The contractor will use the aforementioned program in conjunction with MERLIN and other programs as needed in infer first, linkage of loci (that is, chromosomal regions) to the determination of trait values for each trait; and second, association of SNPs/haplotypes, as susceptibility factors, with trait values (quantitative trait loci, or QTL’s).  Subsequently, infer a set of up to 20 SNPs from each locus identified as a susceptibility region for fine mapping (these will be assembled on a chip and rerun on the entire cohort by the Sardinian contractor, in order to refine the positions and possible identities of the genetic variants important for each trait).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the University of Michigan is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  In particular, Dr. Abecasis is widely recognized as the authority for such analyses, and has provided programs that have been used in more than 250 published studies in the last 3 years.  He has the proven capacity to adapt the programs as needed, and has the facilities and staff to analyze the data and the expertise necessary to interpret the results.  A survey of the literature in this field and recommendations from investigators doing related research shows that there are no other sources for these services.  The period of performance for this service is 12 months.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Philips Medical Systems, 595 Miner Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44143 for service and maintenance for an ACQSIM CT Simulator.       

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $6.5M. 

Period of performance:  September 1, 2006 or upon award, whichever is later with two (2) twelve (12) month options, if exercised by the Government.     

The ACQSIM CT unit is used to treat cancer patients in the NCI clinic. This unit is used for a patient’s initial screening process, treatment planning, and treatment progress.  The work being generated, and the clinical protocols used by the clinic require that current, up to date devices be used. The procurement of the ACQSIM CT Simulator maintenance will allow treatment of patients on current and future protocols.  This machine is vital to the growing success of the NCI, as well as the well being of our patients.

Philips Medical Systems shall provide: 1) an annual preventive maintenance each year; 2) unlimited emergency repair within forty-eight (48) hours; 3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; and 4) provide free software upgrades.  Personnel that have been factory trained on this instrument shall have at least a minimum of one (1) year experience in working on this instrument.     

It is critical to the NCI/CCR that the equipment is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could jeopardize the health of patients.  This system is used to plot the treatment path and procedures, and coordinate with the dosimetry system in planning the dose rate, placement and path of the radiation beam generated by our linear accelerators.  This is the only system at the NCI that can provide the dose treatment planning and analysis needed for each patient under a treatment protocol in the NCI clinic.

The internal components and mechanisms of this instrument are proprietary and Philips Medical Systems is the only known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on this instrument. Updates to the operating software are solely available through Philips Medical Systems, and with Philips Medical Systems being the manufacturer they have unlimited access to parts and technical support. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.     An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on August 11, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-60127-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Non-Oxide Adhesive eXperimental- Revision D (NOAX-D) Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Repair Material. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from from ATK Thiokol, Inc., an affiliant of Alliant Techsystems, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1,which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. The development of an on-orbit Crack Repair Material (CRM) for the Space Shuttle orbiter wing leading edge represents a state-of-the-art technological advancement from the culmination of several years of evaluation and testing.  This advancement is based in part upon the CRM's ability to be applied in the harsh environs of space and still survive the high temperatures of re-entry. Other candidates have been eliminated due to performance in the harsh application environment, cost to develop, or schedule constraints. Currently NOAX-D, supplied by only ATK Thiokol, Inc., is the only known repair material to perform in accordance with the technical requirements imposed by the Shuttle Program. 2. NOAX-D is a paste-like polymer which functions as an environmental barrier to retard oxidation of the carbon/carbon substrate of the Shuttle's Wing Leading Edge.  The NOAX-D is worked in place by a crew member using a spatula to cover the repair site.  After application during the early stages of re-entry, NOAX-D will convert to a ceramic/glass state via pyrolysis (~750„a-1470„a F). Once fully pyrolized, the repair will be capable of surviving temperatures up to a maximum of 2960 degrees Fareinheit for 1200 seconds.  To simulate the harsh environs of application and operation for the repair material, testing has been conducted at the Human Thermal Vacuum (HTV) chamber and the Atmospheric Reentry Materials & Structural Evaluation Facility (ARMSEF).  In addition, NASA has devoted two separate Designed Test Objectives (DTO) on board STS-114 and STS-121 to evaluate the affects of microgravity on repairs made with NOAX-D. These high fidelity tests represent millions of dollars NASA has invested into maturing the NOAX-D repair material to its current level. 3. As stated previously, NOAX-D was invented and is available only from ATK Thiokol. In addition, ATK has intimate experience with the formulation, mixing, packaging, and application of NOAX-D by working and developing the CRM over the last two years. ATK Thiokol is currently the only qualified vendor who can produce NOAX-D for the Agency, and change would require a re-qualification and certification process costing unacceptable budget and schedule impacts.  In order to sustain the production of NOAX-D which has been certified "Safe to Apply" and "Safe to Fly" for the Space Shuttle, it is considered an impractical, as well as inefficient, use of resources to seek a contractor different from the one who initiated the technical effort. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Notes 26 and 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Training Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland University College National Leadership Institute to provide labor, equipment, and materials to conduct a class “The Power of Collaboration withy Simulation”.  This course contains simulations developed exclusively for the NOAA oriented course by the National Leadership Institute at the University of Maryland.  The University will use a 360-assessment “Conflict Dynamics Profile” (CDP) to provide participants the data on their strengths and weaknesses or their conflict behavior, a combination of classroom instruction, assessment and a unique online simulation will be utilized.  Key concepts and techniques of negotiation and how to use them to refine conflict dealing with organizations will be discussed.  This course is aimed at potential conflict between agencies, companies and groups not between individuals.  Vendors who believe that can satisfy the Government=s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis.  This is in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A firm fixed-price delivery order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 August 2006.  Please submit all written responses to Mark Miller via e-mail at Mark.A.Miller@ noaa.gov  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Johns Hopkins University, Animal Research & Resources, Dr. Christian E. Newcomer,  459S Ross Building, 720 Rutland Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21205 for a project to perform wound healing studies on aging rodents to examine inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.   The role of aging in inhibiting wound healing is not known clearly.  In addition, it is unclear how age interacts with inflammation, proliferations, and remodeling.   This contract will design experiments and collect data on factors that promote or inhibit wound healing in aging rodents as a model for investigating tissue regeneration.  The Comparative Medicine Section (CMS) is responsible for the technical support and supply of research animals to the IRP, NIA.  These animals are supplied through both in-house productions and contracts.  CMS maintains a barrier-sustained breeding colony of transgenic mice as centralized resource for the biomedical research community.  Research is conducted on rodent caloric restriction and other dietary changes, wound healing, genetics, immunology and medicine.  Production and quality control programs are concerned with a variety of inbred, transgenic, and random bred rodents and other species.   The purpose of this procurement is to provide the IRP with data on wound healing in aging rodents.  The IRP requires expertise in assessing regimes for studying wound healing in aging rodents.    Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  The cited authority is applicable because Johns Hopkins University is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Newcomer is widely recognized as an expert in animal research, and in using transgenic models in particular.  His recent paper on septicemia and peritonitis (Contemp Top Lab Anim Sci. 2005 Jan;44:35-7) is one of several demonstrating the breadth and depth of his research background and experience.  The close proximity of Dr. Newcomer’s laboratory facilities to the National Institute on Aging is a crucial component of this contract.  We must transport reagents and samples between NIA and Dr. Newcomer’s laboratory in a timely fashion.  Commercial transport is not available for animals in fragile condition undergoing wound healing experiments.  A survey of the literature in this field and a survey of local facilities show that there are no other sources for these services.   The period of performance for this service is 12 months.
The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is 	
$6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt for the requirements of FAR, part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals however, all responses received, within 10 days from the date of notice will be considered by NIA.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number RRB-CMS-6011 may be submitted to NIA, 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, GRC Bldg., Room 1E08, Baltimore, MD  21224, Attention: Pat Meise.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for preparing the Navy’s Theater UnderSea Warfare (TUSW) program for transition to the fleet.  The tools developed in previous years will be integrated under a consolidated Concept of Operations-based user interface, the design of which will be based on lessons learned during prior years.  TUSW is a wide-ranging effort to radically improve the capability of the theater commander to successfully conduct Undersea Warfare (USW) by improving the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, and hence the “actionability” of information collected and processed in-theater by a wide variety of USW assets.  ONR intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Solutions (LMIS&S); 4770 Eastgate Mall; San Diego, CA for these services and requirements.  Under previous developmental efforts, LMIS&S developed the C41 Knowledge Management Terminal (CKMT).  This stand alone terminal encompasses a wide variety of capabilities including: modeling, tracking, and analysis of TUSW data.  Both the initial prototype CKMT and a second generation CKMT were designed, developed, demonstrated, and delivered under NAVAIR contract N00421-02-D-3063.  Additionally, further development was conducted by LMIS&S under ONR contract N00014-00-D-0127/0012. Finally, under ONR contract N00014-05-C-0415 the Asset Allocation Tool (AAT) and a Reconstruction and Data Mining System (RDMS) are in the process of being developed by LMIS&S.  Based on the substantial development previously conducted by LMIS&S, LMIS&S is the only potential offeror with the unique capabilities to perform the work. (See Numbered Note 22).

<DESC>The Securities and Exchange Commission is issuing this Request for Proposal for a study comparing how the different regulatory systems that apply to broker-dealers and investment advisers affect the investors.  Certain entities are ineligible to be selected as Contractor or subcontractors, including: (a) any participant in the litigation against the SEC brought by the Financial Planning Association (FPA v. SEC, Nos. 04-1242, 05-1145 (D.C. Cir.)); (b) PCAOB-registered firms; and (c) any investment adviser, broker-dealer or self-regulatory organization.  Employees and associated persons of such entities are also ineligible, as is any person excluded by statute, regulation or rule from selection, such as an SEC employee.  Nor, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, shall the Contractor or its subcontractors:  (1) appear to have prejudged either the conclusions of this empirical study or the answers to the larger question of the most effective legal and regulatory approach to regulating investment professionals in today’s marketplace; or (2) present other circumstances that cause the Contracting Officer to question the Contractor’s or subcontractor’s impartiality, such as a material conflict of interest.  During contract performance, the Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit for the Contracting Officer’s review any materials that may bear on that determination, including information relating to employment by, representation of, or consulting engagements with any ineligible person within the past three years, updates to any information submitted as part of the Conflict of Interest Certification (Section 5(e) in the original Proposal submission), or such other information as the Contracting Officer may reasonably require.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

It is anticipated that the RFP will result in multiple awards, with a ten (10) year IDIQ contract, including one base year and nine (9) option years.  The contract includes a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure that supports Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Award Fee, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Time and Material (T&M) contract elements. Task Orders will be competed between contractors receiving a base contract award, unless an exception to competition under FAR 16.505(b) (2) exists.  The minimum funding for each of the Global LOGCA P IV contracts is for a core program office. Each offeror shall provide a staff, which will be responsible for keeping company internal plans and deployment lists current, and interacting with a separate planning/support contractor who will be updating the  worldwide management and staffing plan and regional plans. The maximum permitted on each LOGCAP IV contract is $5 billion per year. The contractor shall be required to execute service support in all types of environments, providing combat support, combat service support, and engineering and construction services. Included in the combat service support task is supply operation service.  Notwithstanding the intent to have the contractor perform supply operations, it is not intended that the Government will order supplies for delivery to the Government under this contract. While the contractor is expected to obtain any supplies necessary t o meet their obligations and perform operations and services identified in PWS requirements, Government supply requirements are not a part of the PWS. Combat Support Services.  Includes such services as base camp services of food service, billeting, clothing exchange and bath (CEB)with laundry and minor sewing, latrines, waste management to include hazardous waste, facilities management, morale, welfare and recreation (MWR), information management, fire protection, fire fighting, Signal (Telephone Cable Repair, Cable, Wire, and Antenna Installation, and Access to Communication Networks); sanitation; information management; power generation and distributio n; retrograde (equipment and materiel); and security and badging operations.

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference date and time to be announced.  Contractor must be able to obtain and provide a Secret Level Security Clearance issued by Defense Security Service (DSS) prior to solicitation closing. Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) is an initiative by the United States Army to plan during peacetime for wartime or unforeseen military contingencies using commercial contractors to execute approved plans to provide logistics services and engineering support to augment U.S. forces in support of DOD missions with reasonable assurance of success a nd within reasonable costs.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 561210. This procurement is unrestricted. Release of the solicitation is 15 August 2006. Date for receipt of proposals is 4 October 2006. The principal objective of LOGCAP IV Contract is to provide combat support and combat service support (CS/CSS) augmentation to Combatant Commanders (COCOM) and Army Service Component Commanders (ASCC) throughout the full range of military operations.   LOG CAP services are also available to support military services, coalition and/or multi-national forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies. Each execution contractor would be required to execute logistics support in all types of environments on  multiple task orders, simultaneously, in support of several dozen to tens of thousands of troops per task order in the general areas of supply, field services, and other operations/services.  A second objective, outside the scope of this acquisition, is to provide worldwide and regional planning. This shall be posted via solicitation W52P1J-06-R0072.   We will accomplish these objectives by awarding multiple LOGCAP IV program execution contract s, and a separate LOGCAP planning/support contract.  To preclude any perception of improper competitive advantage, the execution contractors and planning/support contractor can not have any business relationship (teaming, partnering, subcontracting) or fin ancial interests in each other. Each Execution Contractor must work closely with the planning/support contractor to facilitate accurate planning and expedited EVENT execution.  The support contractor will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements with the LOGCAP IV contractors for access to their proprietary information in order to facilitate the planning process. Since the LOGCAP IV Contractors will be working with classifie d operational plans, they must meet National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) requirements to access such information. The Program Execution Contractors will be required to obtain SECRET clearances for any personnel managing classified  information. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. NOTICE TO ALL CONTRACTORS: All contractors who provide goods/services to the Department of Defense (DOD) must be registered in the Central  Contractor's Register (CCR). You cannot be awarded a DOD contract whose solicitation is issued after 31 May 98 if you are not registered in  the CCR. You m ay register via the Internet at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Island fisheries Science Center located in Honolulu, HI is seeking for a contractor to conduct testing of fish gear to reduce sea turtle bycatch and training in turtle-safe practices in Brazil’s longline fisheries.  Contractor  SHALL: 1) Conduct a controlled comparison between standard fishing gear (the control) and alternative fishing gear (the treatment) that is hypothesized or has been demonstrated to reduce leatherback turtle bycatch.  Examples that could be proposed include (but are not limited to: 1) an offer to test size 18/0 circle hook versus some other standard hook currently in use; or 2) an offer to test an alternate type of light lure versus the standard type.  Most importantly, offers must indicate an ability to obtain and use fishing vessel services in Brazil, and to conduct controlled scientific testing as well as to observe, record and report the results, all for the offered price.  The location and season proposed for the gear trials must also have a reasonable expectation (e.g. past average rate) of turtle bycatch frequent enough to result in trial bycatch of at least 10 observed leatherback turtles (combined bycatch by the standard and alternative gear).  Please provide a quote for one year and a quote for an optional additional year of work.  Offers must indicate experience and ability to work in the fishery, and must indicate that the vessels and gears to be used are permitted under the regulations governing the fishery. In the proposed bid, include a description of the standard fishing gear and fishing operations, and what is known or expected about the rate of leatherback turtle bycatch in the location and during the season in which the trials will be conducted. 2)  Train fisheries observers and fishermen in Brazil regarding the best practices to ensure turtle survivorship.  This component involves training of onboard fisheries observers to enable them to monitor and record longline fishing operations at sea. This will entail administration of fisheries observer training programs for a minimum of 25 at-sea observers to provide critical information on sea turtle species caught in different longline gear types and locations.  Trainings will include species identification and proper handling of turtles.  Handling on board could include, but is not limited to, activities such as such as tagging, dehooking, removal of other fishing gear, and release of incidentally-caught sea turtles.  The vendor must also support a discussion forum to be held with fishing communities focusing on incidental catches of sea turtles, bycatch mitigation measures, and the potential for an eco labeling process. Participants should include fishermen and boat owners and must include a demonstration on use of dehooking, line-cutting, and dip net devices and encourage their use when sea turtles are incidentally captured. A firm fixed price purchase order will be issued  with start date of Sept 30, 2006 and end date of Sept  30, 2007.   A request for quotation providing detailed statement of work will be issued on or about Aug 10, 2006.   For a copy of bid package, send your written request to Maria Mendoza by fax at (206)526-6025. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000.00. ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and complete online Representations and Certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control, National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH), Spokane, WA has a requirement for website design and integration services relating to the Nanaoparticle Information Library (NIL) including but not limited to:  (1) Enhance technical functionality so as to fully support the projected increase in traffic.  Refine database, establish contributor sections and protocol, investigate possibility of using AJAX technology and scripting, enhance management features using dbControlX;  (2) Enhance the data collection process and develop interfaces with users, analyzing feedback, research approach of data, implement submission system, create technical mechanisms for contributions to be added in the dbControlX admin panel, process meta searches;  (3) Design a data structure for handling toxicity and health information, devlop and refine data structure, create new functionality in NIL, build specific toxicity and health data;  (4) Establish a fuller integration technically and thematically with other databases, establish links to NIOSH research papers, research related databases;  and   (5) Consult on the development and “marketing” of the site, enhance dbControlX newsletter function, optimize data and web page approach for search engine optimization, develop brochure.  The complete Statement of Work, including deliverables,  is available upon request.   Place of Performance:   Work will be performed primarily at the contractor's facility, although some travel to the NIOSH site in Spokane, WA will be required.   The period of performance is 180 days. 

In Fiscal Year 2005, purchase order 200-2005-M-13583 was awarded under a competitive solicitation to Interactive Consulting, Spokane, WA.   At the onset and prior to development and testing of that initial action, the current requirement could not be anticipated.  Enhancing the Nanoparticle Information Library necessitates a working knowledge of the prototype system and a full understanding of how the computer code is designed to drive the system.  Both the user interface and the functionality of the interactive database must be reworked to meet the Government’s requirements.  Consequently, based upon Interactive Consulting, Inc.’s inherent knowledge of the Nanoparticle Information Library, that would otherwise need to be acquired by other sources resulting in duplicative effort and costs, the Contracting Officer deems there to be a lack of competition and has thus determined Interactive Consulting, Inc. to be the only source reasonably available for this follow-on purchase.  Therefore, this presolicitation notice announces the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s intention to solicit from a single source, Interactive Consulting, Inc.

This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting a quotation or other information within 10 days of this notice.  Quotations or information submitted shall be considered by the agency solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  (1) Experience:  An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel:  Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities:  Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.  Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration of the information submitted.

NAICS Code is changed to 541511

Responses shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer and received within 10 days from issuance of this revised notice.  Information shall be forwarded to Denise Rains,  Reference:  000HCC64-2006-35093 (rev),  Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Spokane Research Laboratory, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA, 99207,    dgr8@cdc.gov; voice, 509/354-8111; or fax 509-354-8099.  

If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days, negotiations will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13 on a sole source basis with Interactive Consulting, Spokane, WA and a purchase order will be awarded on or about August 11, 2006, without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08835 as an 8(a) small business set-aside for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08556 will be issued as a full and open competition with different tasks from this 8(a) small business set-aside RFP. The particulars on the full and open RFP will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available in about 30 days only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible 8(a) small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

•	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
•	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
•	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

(1)  Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(3)  Secure subject matter experts to use in developing, adapting training materials, or conducting training sessions for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

2,  Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD’s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.	The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.  Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.There are no contracts awarded specifically for NCBDDD. The NCBDDD has been accomplishing the statement of work by utilizing task orders competed between the following contracts:     200-2002-00573 Battelle, 200-2002-00574 MACRO, 200-2002-00575 RTI, and 200-2002-00576 SAIC.

<DESC>Amendment 1 is issued to clarify that Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) is the sole coordinator for all state collected West Coast fisheries information and related parameters.  As the sole administrator, PSMFC has proprietary data access to important elements of data to be integrated into the delivered West Coast database system.

The system will provide the information needed for management of fishery resources, protected marine mammals, marine birds, and turtles, and to forecast the ecosystem consequences of fisheries removals, environmental variability and climate change.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) is the senior NATO body responsible for promoting cooperation in research and development of technology in support of production and procurement of defense equipment among NATO nations. The CNAD is comprised of the most senior defense procurement officials from all NATO countries.  

Twice a year the CNAD meets at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to discuss investment in military capabilities. During the CNAD meeting on October 25-26, 2006, the NATO Defense Investment Division will host an industrial exhibition. It will give the representatives of a selected group of companies and research establishments from NATO countries and Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries the opportunity to exhibit their products, as well as research and technology developments. Because it will be held at NATO Headquarters, the exhibition will draw the attention of senior military and diplomatic officials located in Brussels, as well as the senior acquisition decision-makers from capitals who will be attending CNAD.

The available space in the Headquarters is limited and therefore the organizers will have to be highly selective. They will strive for a mix of technologies to be shown, giving priority to exhibits that are interactive in nature. They will be looking for both large and small companies and research institutes to be represented, from as many of the NATO and PfP Partner nations as possible. Exhibitors should note that this exhibit will be open to the general NATO and Partner community and will be in a non-restricted area within NATO Headquarters. The focus will be on technologies and equipment for Special Operations Forces (SOF). 

Participation in this event is generally free of charge, i.e., no entrance fee will be requested by NATO. However, NATO will only cover local operating costs (light, heat, electricity). All other expenses (transportation of the equipment to the exhibition site at NATO Headquarters, insurance, setting up the equipment, manning the booth, etc.) will be the responsibility of the exhibitors themselves.

ELIGIBLITY

Requests for participation sent directly to NATO cannot be considered. If your firm would like to apply for participation in this exhibition, you must first complete a Questionnaire that will be provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To request a copy of the CNAD Questionnaire, send an email to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov or Dnewsom@bis.doc.gov.  

The completed Questionnaire must be submitted to the CNAD Exhibition Team no later than 5 September 2006. Instructions for submission will be included with the Questionnaire. Also included will be information on SOFs and their associated requirements. 

The selection of exhibitors will be completed by 11 September 2006. NATO CNAD will inform all applicants, whether selected or not, about the results of the selection process. A handbook that will assist in the set-up for and conduct of the event, will then be sent to the selected exhibitors.

<DESC>1.  Is it possible to provide separate general requirements for the Hand Held Test Device and the Ground Test Set? Answer:    At this time it is not possible to separate the general requirements.  The requirements are for both the Hand Held System and the Ground Based System.  The difference would be that the Ground Based System would be larger heaver and be able to display more information to the user. 2.  Please verify that the quantities for the Ground Test Sets are correct. Answer:  The quantities listed in the RFI are correct for both the Hand Held Test Set and the Ground Based Test set. 3.  What is the level of classification (both operating and non-operating) that is expected for both the Hand Hel Test Devices and the Ground Test Sets, and what features would the contractor need to incorporate in the units to satisfy Customer Security Requirements? Answer:  The test box will be considered classified when any of the testing programs are loaded.  The test box should have a zeroized function so that at the end of the day the operator can declassify the system.  This applies to both the Hand Held Test set and the Ground Based Test Set. 4.  Does the power requirement for the Ground Test Set include batteries, a UPS, or is shore power sufficient?   Answer:  Internal batteries and shore power should be considered for the Ground Based Units.  The units should be able to take shore power from 12-24VDC and 110-240VAC. 5.  Will the Blue Force Communication frequencies be made available to the contractor? Answer:  Yes, the Blue Force Communications frequencies will be made available. 6.  Is there an estimated date available for the requirements document to be issued? Answer:  No date has been set for the requirements document. 7.  Will the Ground Based Test Sets also be required to radiate through transmit antennas and measure the UUT response through receive antennas (as in the Portable Test Device), or will it only be required to inject stimulus signals and measure the responding RF signal to the UUT antennas through direct connect RF cables? Answer:  Both systems should be able to use transmit and receive antennas and be able to direct connect to the system under test. 8.  What are the RF ranges that the CREWS operate to? Answer :  Both the Hand Held and Ground Based Test Boxes need to be able to go from 20 MHz to 2.5 GHz with the ability to be expanded at a future date to 6.5 GHz.  This information in and of itself is not classified. 9.  Please confirm if all of the general requirements are applicable to the Hand Held Device – for example, is the Hand Held Device required to test CTP and provide direct input into the UUT? Answer:  Yes, both the Hand Held Device and the Ground Based Device should be able to provide and receive direct input from the UUT. General Note: Some aspects of this program may become classified at a future date.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN CANCELLED:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Carter Center, Atlanta, GA.  

Purpose:

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), in compliance with its knowledge development and application mission, seeks to influence service systems change beneficial to persons with serious mental illness.  The Division of Service and Systems Improvement (DSSI) in CMHS has initiated a broad program of knowledge communication and application in areas where there is a high demand for information and where there is information available regarding evidence-based practices.  One of the priority areas for services development within the SAMHSA matrix of priorities is prevention and treatment for older person with mental illness. Another priority for SAMHSA, as stated in the President’s New Freedom Commission Final Report (2003) is “Better coordination is needed between mental health care and primary health care” (p.23). Particularly for older adults, there is a critical need to achieve this goal of better integration of behavioral and primary healthcare because this is what older consumers want and because it more efficiently meets the needs of older consumers who often present with multiple and complex health and behavioral health needs. Evidence-based practices have been established in the area of behavioral health and primary care integration for older adults, but this information requires widespread dissemination and efforts toward implementation in the field. Major depression imposes the greatest disability burden of any mental or general medical condition in the United States.  
The Carter Center is uniquely qualified to conduct the project described in this requirement The Government could not achieve the specific objectives of this contract through any other means or with any other resources. In 1991, Rosalynn Carter developed The Carter Center Mental Health Task Force, to guide the activities of The Carter Center Mental Health Program and to improve mental health care by supporting the implementation of policy change, and to develop initiatives to reduce stigma and discrimination.  The Mental Health Program is currently engaged as a leading, organizational entity in an important, high profile, national initiative for changing and improving the public policy environment for treating depression in primary care.  The Mental Health Program’s national stature, convening power, and reputation as an honest broker make it uniquely qualified to bring together representatives from the public and private, as well as nongovernmental sectors to identify policy barriers to real-world implementation and to develop action steps for bringing evidence-based models to complex practice settings.  A specific strength of The Carter Center Mental Health Program is the ability to facilitate and promote policy change by identifying key stake holders and decision makers and bringing them together to undertake collective action.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.

As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).

It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide additional information on the TDP  and the Solicitation.  Please note the changes to the solicitation as noted  below. In regard to the TDP: 1)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P7 â€“ Where is the data for this booklet?  Is this GFM?      The operatorâ€™s instruction pamphlet will be provided as GFM. 2)   DWG 9209204 â€“ P8 â€“ Is this leakage test required at the final LAP level or  at the ammo can vendor level?       The leakage test is required at the final LAP level 3)  DWG 932241 â€“ Olin is the only approved source.  We are aware that Olin has been running at capacity for several months filling contractors requirements  for 40mm M781.  What is TACOMâ€™s view on allowing other sources?      The TDP is for informational proposes only.  The round has to meet the  Performance Specification provided in the Solicitation.  Note that currently  Olin is the only .38 Caliber Case vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;  another vendor may be qualified in the future.   4)DWG 9275763 â€“ Why is this drawing in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded. 5)DWG 9345327 â€“ Same question as question #1      Currently Olin is the only primer vendor that has been qualified for the M1006;another vendor may be qualified in the future.  6)HCSDS 643 â€“ Why is this in the TDP?      This document should be disregarded.   7) The drawing for the silhouette was not provided with the TDP.      Drawing number 6006874 entitled Target Silhouette â€œEâ€ Kneeling is not part of the TDP.  Please send an email to kgorman@pica.army.mil to request a copy. 8)Is there a TDPL?      The TDPL is Document: 06BBH210A on the CD.  You may right click on the CD  and hit the explore option.  There is a version of the TDPL (06BBH210A) in  Adobe and in WordPad.  You may access the TDPL using either of the two programs.  9)Is there a drawing or more information about the tube the rounds are  placed in with the ammo can?      The dimensions of the tube are in lower right side of drawing 9209204.  In  the upper left side of the same drawing there is a â€œLIST OF PARTSâ€ box.  Line #12 and remarks C and F under the list of parts box give the specifications the  tubes are governed by.  If you look up the specifications it will give further  information on how the tube should be constructed. In regard to the solicitation: 1)Page 1 of 101 â€“ the Government says see schedule for deliver.  We  believe it says later F.O.B. origin. Please confirm with location.      Reference page 14 for Delivery information.  All items are F.O.B Origin. 2)Page 1 of 101- The government has identified the NAISC code as 332992.   Is this correct.  Ammunition over 30mm is typically 332993.        Reference page 1 block 10 and page 6 paragraph 5, the NAICS code shall be  corrected to state 332993,  the Size Standard Shall remain 1500.    3)Page 1 (& 67) of 101 â€“ The Government has identified this contract as  a small business set aside.  What is the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the  employee size and annual sales as it applies to small business and this SIC code?  What is the government interpretation in regard to subsidiaries, joint  ventures, etc.  What is the governments level of interest in ensuring that this  is awarded to true small business?  Will there be any requirement or  investigation beyond the standard SBA response of â€˜self certificationâ€™ without  independent 3rd party evaluation.        Since this solicitation involves furnishing a manufactured product, the size standard is stated in number of employees (in this solicitation that is 1,500), there is no annual sales figure involved.  The employees of any company  affiliated with an offeror (whether it is a parent company, sister company,  subsidiary, etc.) would have to be included in the total employee count.  In  federal acquisition there is no certification process for small business other  than self certification. Therefore an independent 3rd party evaluation will not  be a requirement.  However, any interested party can initiate a size protest if  the size of a business is in question.    4)Page 10 of 101 â€“ CLINs 0005 through 0009 require that the contractor  must produce at a minimum rate of 40,000 per month, yet the first pricing tier  could be only 50,000 units.  Therefore the contractor would have to produce  40,000 the first month and then 10,000 the next month.  Is it not possible to split the award quantity over a span that would allow for continuous production  for a few months?      It is possible that the award will spread out to allow for continuous  production for a few months.  However, for bidding purposes assume a minimum  rate 40,000 per month. In your example this would mean 40,000 the first month  and then 10,000 the next month. 5)Page 10 of 101 â€“ In the situation noted above the contractor could be idle for several months of a continuous 12 month period.  From the point of  award of option 2, after being idle several months, what is the expected ramp  up timeframe?      Depending on if we exercise the Max. Range or not, the typical ramp-up  time for full-scale production would be 6 to 8 months for a small Contractor. 6)Page 10 of 101 â€“ Will the contractor be allow to deliver at amounts  greater than 40,000 in advance of actual delivery requirements?      The contractor is required to submit a proposal based on the delivery  schedule and quantity in the solicitation.  However, after contract award this  issue could be readdressed.  7)Page 21 of 101 â€“ States Bars codes required.  Attachment 8 and age 59  says 2D barcode.  Is not all DOD now 3D bar code required?        The 2D barcode is correct. 8)In response to question 1 regarding the TDP DWG 9209204 â€“ P7, Page 21 of  101- States no Government Furnish Property shall be provided.  This shall be  modified to state Government Furnished Property shall be provided since the Government will be providing the operatorâ€™s instructions pamphlet.  On page 23- of 101 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property Short Form shall be added to this  solicitation 9)  Page 25 of the solicitation AIE Clause (ARDEC 34) paragraph b.  states â€œ(except for any AIE listed as available in section H or appendix I)â€.  We are unable to find Section H or Appendix I.       Since this is a commercial contract not subject to the uniform contract  format (UCF), there are no sections.  Please reference page 16 for a basic  guide when clauses reference a UCF section.  In ARDEC 34 which reference H or  appendix I (52.212-1  or 52.212-4), there is no AIE listed as available in the  referenced sections.   10)Page 31 of 101 â€“ Does TACOM have MSDS from current inventory of M1006?        There is no MSDS for the M1006. 11)Page 33 of 101-The schedule listed on Page 14 of the solicitation  identified First Article being required 210 Days ADC. The First Article â€“  Contractor Testing Clause found on page 33 identifies a 180 day requirement for  submittal of the FAT report.      Page 34 shall be corrected to read 210 calendar days.  12)Page 44 of 101- 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation- Is it a requirement to have unique item identifiers on each ammunition?     A unique item identifier is not required on the individual ammunitions.  The solicitation shall be revised to remove items listed under 252.211-7003 (c)  (1)(ii). 13)  Page 58 of 101 â€“ 3.1.3 Design Verification Test â€“ If this is the  governmentsâ€™ design/TDP in what instances will a DVT be required or not required?      If the item has been produced before to the technical data package that  the vendor is to use and there have not been any modifications to the design (i.e. Engineering Changes), then the DVT could in theory be waived or just not  conducted.  We would still need to ascertain whether or not the vendorâ€™s  process is capable or â€œrobustâ€ because this is his/her first time producing the  item and First Article Testing (with subsequent Lot Acceptance Testing) is the vehicle to use to do that.  14)  Page 87 of 101 â€“ under proposal format Part â€“B design format.  What is  there a design element if there is a full and functional TDP without clear new  design parameters?      The TDP is for informational purposes only.  When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).  DD Form 1423  has no Blocks 17 and 18.     Block 17. Price Group and 18.

When proposing, it is not  required that one build to the TDP.  One can utilize their own design built to  the performance specification.   15)  Page 87 of 101-There are issues with the requirements for the number of  volumes and copies required to be submitted for this solicitation. Page 87 says  Proposal Format a) the proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set  forth in the table below. The table describes four volumes to be submitted.        Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Format paragraph a) shall be revised to  state â€œThe proposal shall be submitted in three volumes as set forth in the  table below.â€ 16)  Page 87 of 101-Lists the quantities for Volumes 1,3, & 4 but no requirements for Volume 2.  Also Directions for submittal of Volume 4  (Price/Cost) listed on page 87, paragraph d contradict the requirements listed  for the submission of Volume 4 listed on page 91.       Page 87 of 101 entitled Proposal Instructions paragraph b shall be revised to state â€œOriginal and four paper copies of Technical, Management Factor and  Past Performance.â€  Paragraph d shall be revised to state â€œTwo electronic  copies of (c) aboveâ€¦..â€  Page 91 of 101 is correct as stated.  17)  Page 89 of 101 - Volume I, Technical part C: Is the listed information  required, if contractor has an up-to-date ISO 9001-2000 Certification, e.g.  design of inspection and testing equipment, quality system plan, etc.?      Reference page 82 of 101 ARDEC 148 Offerorâ€™s Quality Assurance System (b) (1). If you indicate in your response to this solicitation that your quality  system conforms to one of the listed standards in Section E â€“ Higher Level  Contract Quality Requirement FAR 52.246-11, this is a sufficient description. You need not further describe your quality system in your response to the solicitation. 18)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Where do we get copies of ARDEC 148 and ARDEC 34?    As stated on page 22 of 101, Clauses incorporated by reference can be accessed at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.  Click on local link and select local  clauses.  The clauses are listed in numeric order. 19)   Page 89 of 101 â€“ Part B â€“ (b) â€“ To supply test reports and data implies  that the contract must have already produced the round.  Is it a requirement of  the contract that the bidder have produced the round previously?        We are not requiring the round to have been previously produced.  The M1006 solicitation is based on the provided Performance Specification.  The bidder may answer the solicitation with a round that meets the requirements outlined in the Performance Specification.  In the event that another round other than the M1006 is submitted ARDEC would like to review any test data as outlined in the Performance Specification for the round being submitted.  The M1006 has test data generated from previous qualification testing.   20)  Page 89 of 101 - Proposal Instructions, item a) refers to Contract Data  requirements List (DD Form 1423 with blocks 17 and 18 completed).  DD Form 1423  has no Blocks 17 and 18.     Block 17. Price Group and 18. Estimated total price are located in the right margin of the CDLR. 21)  Page 90 of 101- States Volume II Management Factor consists of 3 Parts.  Only two parts Part A and Part B are listed. Please Clarify.    Page 90 of 101 shall be corrected to stated Volume II-Management Factor  Consists of 2 parts. 22)  Page 92 of 101 â€“ Does the government have a spreadsheet like this it is  could provide to all contractors, so that there are no formula or mathematical  errors that could adversely effect the award of the contract?     It is not necessary for the Government to supply this spreadsheet to all  contractors.  This is just a sample of how the weighted guidelines will be  computed.  When submitting a proposal one only need to provide a price for each  line item and quantity range.  The Governmentâ€™s Price analysis will perform the  weighted average analysis for total price. 23)  Page 98 of 101 â€“ Evaluation of offers TDP.  Please explain what there is a  separate TDP from the government supplied TDP?     One can submit a technical data package based on the performance  specifications.  It is not a requirement to follow the Governmentâ€™s TDP.  The Governmentâ€™s TDP is for informational purposes only.   24)  General â€“ Is there a page limitation?      There is no page limit. 25)  General â€“ Do each section of the proposal need to stand alone?  I.E. â€“ If  we discuss additional quality aspects outside of the quality section (Technical Factor, Part C) as they relate to another area will these comments be included  in the overall evaluation?  If not, MAST may have to be more repetitive to  ensure that each section has adequate content.        When submitting the proposal it is best to be as clear as possible.  Iâ€™d  suggest addressing each section as a stand alone.  If this is not practicable,  please reference the specific.   26)  General-This solicitation includes a performance specification and  drawings.  Does our submission have to meet the performance specification only  and are we free to use our design?  Alternatively, must we adhere to the  supplied drawings and the performance specification?       The item does need to meet the performance specification. You may use your own design, however, it still must meet the requirements in the performance spec.The technical data package (TDP) is for informational purposes only.  You can choose to design to the TDP, but it is not a requirement of this solicitation.

The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Hazards Team, Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), has a continuing requirement for programming services to complete Phase 3 in development of the Probability Density Function (PDF) System.  These services will include: 1) Perform software enhancements to the newly-developed PDF System; 2) Incorporate user feedback/comments from Phase 2 distribution; 3) Develop API to PDF server/database; 4) Develop system administration GUI; 5) Save waveform and PDF images to eps, jpeg, gif; and 6) Develop additional and enhanced data views.  The work requires expert knowledge of initial development, design and performance of PDF System, familiarity with the ANSS network, and expert level knowledge of the SEED seismic data format.  Richard Boaz of Boaz Consultancy developed the USGS PDF algorithm, coded and installed Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Boaz Consultancy, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.

<RESPDATE>081406
<ARCHDATE>08012007
<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Central Region CICT and MRT has a requirement to assemble a novel state-of-the-art instrument to analyze the gas composition of fluid and melt inclusions in hydrothermal and igneous minerals. This instrument will utilize an existing 213 nm laser to open the inclusions. A fast, sensitive mass spectrometer is required to characterize the gas composition of the high amplitude, short duration, bursts of gas released from the inclusions, using FASTLIGHT-2. Digitial Signal Averager, Fast Preamplifer with 3-m. The only vendor able to supply a Quadrupole Ion Trap - Reflectron Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (QIT-ReTOF MS) suited for this specific application is R.M. Jordan Co., Inc.'s Ion Trap EGUN Assembly. The Government requires a QIT -ReTOF MS with an electron gun to ionize the gas released from the inclusions and a triple plate detector for enhanced sensitivity along with supporting electronics. The quadrupole ion trap can store ions for periods as long as 10 seconds or as short as 10 microseconds prior to mass analysis via pulsed dc extraction in the ReTOF-MS. A nearly 100% duty cycle (ie. all ions generated are detected) is obtained with ion storage periods of 10 milliseconds or more, which is ideal for our application. The quadrupole ion trap also has the ability to trap a wide range of masses (e.g. 10-5000) or a narrow range (e.g. 44-46) which is required to identify all of the gases present in an inclusion or to measure the isotopes present in a single gas species. The sensitivity of these instruments for typical analytes is in the low femptomole range, which is required for our application. This instrument also has a resolution of about 2000 for low masses, which is needed to distinguish interferences between gas molecules with similar masses. Based on information available at this time and in accordance with 41.U.S.C. 253© (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies/services specified as a sole source from: R. M. Jordan Co., Inc., 999 Golden Gate Terrace, Grass Valley, CA 95945, the manufacturer, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. A affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Sin no solicitation document exist, request for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.This requirement will only be process to the point of award, funds are currently not available for this requirement.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH SYNOPSIS The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully or partially satisfying an emerging requirement for a cargo air delivery system. MCWL is interested in identifying equipment and technical support available for bailment to support technical demonstrations and experimentation to develop the tactics, techniques, and procedures needed to employ air delivery as a method of sustaining small dispersed tactical units.  This effort is part of the MCWL Sea Viking 08 (SV 08) series of experiments. This market research is for informational purposes and will lead to individual meetings between MCWL and organizations with the potential to fulfill the requirements for this support to the lab’s experiments and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting combat development strategy for the proposed requirements.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide propriety data or business sensitive information because any information received may be used by the government and/or released to the public.   The government is focused primarily on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items that can be easily modified to meet existing government requirements to support the military experimentation scheduled in Chart (1) below: CHART #1 Event	Dates / Duration	Location Technical Demonstration	January 2007 / Duration TBD by the contractor (Typically 1-day).	At the contractor site Limited Technical Assessment  (LTA #1) This is a Technical Demonstration at the same range where experimentation will take place.	Late March 2007/ An 11-day period of Assessment is planned. Vehicle performance will be limited to a few days of that period. 	A Military Training Center, West Coast, USA Small Unit Enhancement Training (SUET #1)	July 2007/ An 19-day period of Training for Support Unit Marines during which vehicle performance will be limited to a few days	A Military Training Center, West Coast, USA Limited Objective Experiment #3  (LOE #3)	September 2007/ An 18-day period of experimentation during which vehicle use will be necessary for 5 days during which up to 4 sorties will be required as dictated by the tactical play	A Military Training Center, West Coast, USA Information on capable sources is sought for the following requirements Performance Parameters of the Air Delivery Vehicle 1.	Transport Load Requirements	a. Minimum 200 lbs. b. Maximum 800 lbs. 2.	Accuracy Requirements	Must deliver load within a 200 meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) in winds up to 10 mph 3.	Departure/Launch Requirements Note: MCWL is looking at three (3) categories.	1. Must be able to launch from a standard military Expeditionary Airfield (EAF Category), OR 2. Must be able to be dropped from a Standard Military Aircraft (Air-Drop Category), OR 3. Must be able to launch from an Unimproved Road (Combat Service Support Category) 4.	Transit Distance Requirement	The experimental support requirement is transit of cargo for a minimum of 20 miles.  Note: This experimental requirement is driven by the real-world operational requirement to transit approximately 200 miles. 5.	Handling Requirement	In order to ensure the survivability of the cargo, the package cannot be subjected to more than 8 “G” of force upon landing.  Note: This is the current parachute parcel specification. 6.	OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: The following are NOT hard requirements for participation in the SV 08	o	It is more useful to the experimentation if Marines can be trained on how to operate the system (the level of oversight/supervision/help is up to the contractor) o	The ability of the vehicle to operate in hours of daylight and/or darkness must be defined in the individual meetings.  The ability to do both is not an experimental requirement but will likely be part of the final set of operational requirements. o	Whether or not the receiving unit has to assist final delivery (i.e. by beacon or remote control) or not (i.e. a parachute) is immaterial to experimentation These are the performance characteristics needed for experimentation. For the purposes of this market research synopsis, a Marine Corps small unit is defined as either a 13-man squad or a 43 man platoon equipped with up to four light vehicles, associated weapons and communications suites, and other standard-issue equipment.  Consumable materials may include bulk liquids (fuel and water), ammunition, batteries, food, and limited repair parts.  If the product proves successful in the technical demonstration, a decision will be made as to whether there is utility in including those technologies in the SV 08 series of experiments.  Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements and expressions of interest that provide the necessary information to determine actual capabilities.  At a minimum, the information should include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) company’s or organization’s assertion of full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business contracts, marketing office point(s) of contact information; (4) notification of business size and/or special status; and (5) additional information that may be useful to successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited.  These expressions of interest shall adhere to a five-page submission limit, plus commercial marketing information or web links; all should be submitted via email to ira.patterson@usmc.mil referencing the following tracking #9080.  For Technical Issues contact Major H.E. Bermiss at hassan.bermiss@usmc.mil or (703)432-1030. They should be submitted on or before Cl!  ose Of Business (COB) 15 August 2006.  This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the government, and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.

<DESC>This announcement will be used as a market research tool.  The government is in the position to research commercially available inertial navigation units (INU) for possible future acquisitions.  A general description of the required item is as follow s:  the INU would function as an inertial reference system (pointing device) and land navigator for a variety of military systems in support of the Soldier.  This inertial navigation platform would be required to interact with an array of previously establ ished system components with little or no decrease in current operating capabilities.  The potential systems range from basic personnel carriers to complex weapons and/or sensing platforms with a varying degree of sensitivity and accuracy requirements.  A single INU design need not be able to perform with every system so multiple versions would be acceptable.  Minor modifications for missionization would be also expected.  No Government-owned interface control document (ICD) is currently available.  Any inf ormation that is provided and/or potentially developed by any prospective supplier would remain proprietary unless/until rights are purchased by the Government.  The purpose of this notice is to identify and establish initial interest and points of contact  from private industry.  This information may be used to design acquisition strategy to include socioeconomic program support.  It may also help to identify and establish commercial practices available to the government.  All responses to this notice shoul d include the following:  Company Name, Point of Contact, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers, E-mail address, Brief Description of Company/Capabilities, Experience areas, History, DUNS Number, CAGE Code and/or Tax ID Number, as well as Size Category (Large /Small Disadvantage, etc).

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Training Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland University College National Leadership Institute to provide labor, equipment, and materials to conduct a class “The Power of Collaboration withy Simulation”.  This course contains simulations developed exclusively for the NOAA oriented course by the National Leadership Institute at the University of Maryland.  The University will use a 360-assessment “Conflict Dynamics Profile” (CDP) to provide participants the data on their strengths and weaknesses or their conflict behavior, a combination of classroom instruction, assessment and a unique online simulation will be utilized.  Key concepts and techniques of negotiation and how to use them to refine conflict dealing with organizations will be discussed.  This course is aimed at potential conflict between agencies, companies and groups not between individuals.  Vendors who believe that can satisfy the Government=s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis.  This is in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A firm fixed-price delivery order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 August 2006.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis (SSS) only. There is no solicitation available. This request is for planning purposes only, and it does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes. It is not an indication the government will contract for the services contained in this SSS. The government shall not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this SSS.

Similar information has previously been sought under FedBizOpps announcements concerning: Draft RFP for PATE; sources sought synopses under the project names: Specialized Scientific, Engineering and Laboratory Management, Services and Support (SSELMSS), Specialty Network Laboratory Capability (SNLC), Materials Technology Specialized Program Support II (MTSPII), and Materials Technology Specialized Program Support (MTSPS).  

In an effort to determine if this acquisition is suitable for small businesses, the US Air Force is seeking information specifically from small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) small business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns only that have a Top Secret facility security clearance.  Capability packages submitted by interested small business entities, small business joint ventures, or teaming arrangements will be reviewed to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy.

PATE requirements are listed in parts I and II that follow:

I.  The PATE support services involve: in-house operation and management of specific laboratory functions at a Government facility; laboratory data trend analysis and reporting; nuclear engineering analysis and particle transport analysis; chemical engineering and related disciplines; inorganic, organic, analytical, physical and biological chemistry; molecular biology; microbial biology; virology; immunology; biological engineering; mechanical engineering and related disciplines; aerobiological modeling; and meteorology.

II. The PATE requirements will also require a contractor to maintain industry awareness of cutting-edge and/or specialized laboratory and technological services.  Additionally, a significant subcontracting opportunity for these services, as the requirements and sources are identified and needed, is anticipated.  These subcontracting opportunities would include: molecular biology to include real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR); genetic sequencing and micro-array technologies; microbial culture; immunology to include protein screening and mass spectroscopy technologies (including MSnth technologies); separation of biological materials of interest from complex sample matrices; meteorological support to include models of transport and diffusion processes; assay protocol/trouble shooting; enhancement of existing laboratory protocols; biochemical, chemical, microbiological, and/or immunological analyses; aerobiological modeling enhancement or modification to database platforms; and field test support and general sampler engineering development and design.  End of II. 

Although a 50% limitation on subcontracting (FAR 52.219-14) would normally apply for the significant PATE subcontracting opportunities (part II above), a waiver of this contract clause applying to the subcontracting of cutting-edge and/or specialized laboratory and technological services will be considered in order to enable an otherwise qualified small business to participate in this acquisition. 

Firms with a Top Secret facility clearance that respond to this announcement should express their experience in providing PATE-type services and their capability in providing the following minimum types of qualified, Top Secret-cleared resources for PATE:

1.  Any three personnel from two or more of the following four types of qualifications:
(i) molecular biology
(ii) microbiology
(iii) immunology or protein chemistry
(iv) biochemistry

2.  Any one person from any of the following two types of qualifications:
(i) nuclear engineering or nuclear physics
(ii) inorganic, organic, analytical, physical chemistry or chemical engineering

3.  Any one person from any of the following two types of qualifications:
(i) mechanical engineering and related discipline
(ii) meteorological sciences

4.  An additional person from any of the above listed eight qualifications.

Respondents should include their assigned Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) code.  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.  Include your Government assigned company Facility Code (also called CAGE code) for the applicable facility and storage facility that would safeguard any classified data supplied by the Government. 

Prospective firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary (maximum length 10 pages) describing the firm’s expertise and related experiences in meeting the requirements stated above to the contract specialist:  daniel.gill@patrick.af.mil.  A Top Secret facility clearance is required.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to award a contract on a non-competitive basis the services required for monitoring, coordinating, and preparing final reports for inclusion in an IND submission to the FDA of a GLP  study of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases hantavirus DNA vaccines.  The study will be conducted at a contract research organization and will include gene gun vaccination of hamsters with the hantavirus DN A vaccine s.   The anticipated award will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to Walker, Downey & Associates, Inc., Verona, WI  53593. The study was planned as part of a contract with Powderject Vaccines, Inc (PJV). PJV was sold to PowderMed vaccines, Inc. (PMV) Oxford, UK.     PMV does not employ in-house individuals able to conduct the work supporting the preclinical GLP study that we require.  Instead, they subcontract Walker-Downey & Associates, Inc., a consulting company that was formed by personnel formerly employed at PJV.  There are no other individuals who have access to and training for use of the gene gun proprietary technology and standard operating procedures.  In addition to these unique qualifications, Walker Downey Associates successfully managed the first of the tw o preclinical GLP studies that we require. Consultation by personnel from Walker-Downey & Associates, Inc. is the only way to achieve continuity and consistency, which will allow on-time submission of the IND to the FDA.  Without such consultation, the Gov ernment will lose significant time and money and will be unable to meet the DTO milestones. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to:  USAMRIID, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD  20702, via FAX at 3 01-619-2254 or emailed to anthony.petrore@amedd.army.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this electronic notice must be made by 5:00 PM on July 31, 2006.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evid ence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY AGGREGATE SPRAY FOR AIR PARTICULATE (ASAP)
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
AGGREGATE SPRAY FOR AIR PARTICULATE (ASAP)

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license a new tool for Homeland Security and Department of Defense efforts to reduce or eliminate potential personal exposure to terrorist-related biological and “dirty bomb” weapon particulates.  This will assist emergency responders and aid in protecting public health. 

Background: This invention was conceived in response to the events that occurred between October 2 and November 2, 2001 when letters containing a powdered form of 
B. anthracis were mailed through the United States Postal Service resulting in the contamination of government and private facilities (US EPA 2002). According to government specialists, the geographic scope of the incidents was increased by the cross-contamination of mail.  In bringing affected buildings back into service, reaerosolization of these bioaerosols occurred due to particle dynamics and the airflow patterns in the buildings and in the building ventilation systems that required multiple decontamination efforts (NIOSH 2002). The developing terrorist threat of “dirty bombs” expanded the products’ focus to these hazardous particulates. 

Description:  This copolymer and solvent solution is used to bind with airborne hazardous particulates, such as biological weapon agents or toxic “dirty bomb” by-products. This solution can be delivered as an aerosol, spray, or coating to lock hazardous particulates in place and prevent reaerosolization of the contaminant. 

Advantages:  This product was developed based on the chemical, physical, and biological properties of hazardous agents to ensure a binding of the agent within the copolymer film. The particulates are tightly bound within the water-based copolymer matrix to facilitate cleanup. This product can be used as part of a primary response for suspected biological weapon response from the workplace to the battlefield. It can also be applied to particulate isolation requirements relating to post-detonation “dirty bomb” contamination. This product can be deployed to reduce the spread of contaminants and protect our troops and emergency responders. 

Potential Applications: Responders to a suspect hazardous material in a populated area will be able to isolate and contain the material while it is fully evaluated. For explosive events, whether in the public arena or on the battlefield, returning quickly and efficiently back to full operations would be greatly aided with this product. Addressing the impetus for this invention, the decontamination and return to a normal mode of operations for affected areas can be achieved more quickly, safely, and in a cost-effective manner.  

Features:	
Product formulations were developed, and tested to adhere to toxic material based on their specific biological, chemical, and physical properties;

Delivery parameters are developed to make the product safe to apply, store, and transport;

Water soluble and non-conductive.

Benefits:
Potential for inhalation and ingestion, the human toxic intake routes, are greatly reduced or eliminated in a manner specific to the hazard;
	
Application, even in large areas, will require less PPE;
	
Easy application, with electronics unaffected. Easy, safe clean up.

Development Status:  
Multiple tests of the characteristics of the formula including adhesion strength, elasticity, density, drying-time, viscosity, pH, surface tension and the copolymer’s performance in wind tunnel tests indicate the product’s effectiveness against highly refined aerosolized Bacillus atrophaeus spores, a simulant for anthrax spores.  

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

<SUBJECT>--Modification to the Infrared Countermeasures Test Resources Requirements Study Workshop Notice
<DESC>DO NOT CONTACT SHERRI COMER FOR IFORMATION.  PLEASE CONTACT THE POC LISTED BELOW.  The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) will hold the first workshop for the Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) Test Resources Requirements Study (ITRRS) on August 29 31, 2006, in Chicago, Illinois.  The ITRRS, a Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) study, is a collaborative effort between TRMC and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) to design a roadmap that will guide future improvem ents in Department of Defense IRCM test resources, necessary to keep abreast with advancements in IRCM systems and heat-seeking missiles.   In this interactive meeting, we are limiting participation to organizations responsible for either developing IRCM systems or designing tests to determine if IRCM systems meet requirements and specifications.  We hope to leverage our participants knowledg e of expected future test plan use cases, which the IRCM community will use to form the baseline of the roadmap.  The workshop will focus on defining drivers, use cases, architecture, test concepts and sample test plans.  A second workshop in the March 200 7 timeframe will focus on IRCM test resources and will include organizations responsible for developing test resources or actually conducting IRCM testing.  The goal of these workshops is to create a multi-directional exchange of current and desired capabi lities, plans, information, issues, data, lessons-learned, and best practices, which will allow us to work together to provide comprehensive IRCM resources for the Department of Defenses test needs. The workshop will be held at the W Lakeshore Hotel in Chicago beginning at 0800 on August 29 and concluding at 1200 on August 31.  The meeting will be unclassified and there is no registration fee.  A detailed agenda, registration form, hotel information a nd read aheads are posted on http://www.acq.osd.mil/trmc/cteip/itrrs/.  Please register by August 14 if you plan to attend.  The point of contact for this meeting is Leslie Morgan (leslie.morgan.ctr@osd.mil, (703) 601-5202).

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the AIT-3 Internal Tape Drive for Hewlett Packard Servers.  The use of a Cybernetics Tape Drive is essential to the Government’s requirements for server compatibility thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the Cybernetics Tape Drive for Hewlett Packard Servers (Part Number CY-8103-00/HP).  Tape media is the primary backup media of use for the Department of State per FAM guidelines for system backup.  Department have standardized on AIT tape format for several years.  The Cybernetics AIT tape drives have been identified as the only internal tape drive that will work with servers in the field.  Use of third party equipment that is not compatible with servers will create equipment installation and configuration conflicts as well as increase the cost of providing tape backup solutions on Department’s classified and unclassified network.   To ensure compatibility with existing servers in the field the Internal AIT-3 Tape Drive must be a Cybernetics unit and provided by a Cybernetics reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cybernetics (Part Number CY-8103-00/HP). as a key component of the Department’s backup system.  Servers in the field have a single 1.6” hot plug tape drive bay and to ensure compatibility with existing servers, the Internal AIT-3 Tape Drive must be a Cybernetics unit and provided by a Cybernetics reseller. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s backup system. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Program Management and Analysis Program (IRM/OPS/PMA).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the Hewlett Packard servers as domain controller and member servers on Department of State’s unclassified and classified network.  The use of Hewlett Packard are essential to the Government’s requirements, for critical server compatibility and network security, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company at this time. The Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p Server (configured to GITM specifications, and Hewlett Packard DL380 G4 (configured to GITM specifications,) Member Server have been identified as a key component of the Department’s core server infrastructure.  IRM ITCCB approved the use of Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified network.   Servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility along with integrated management functions with existing equipment.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the domain controller and member servers must be HP DL360 G4p and DL380 G4 servers and provided by a Hewlett Packard reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p Server (configured to GITM specifications) and Hewlett Packard DL380 G4 (configured to GITM specifications) member servers as a key component of the Department’s core server infrastructure.  HP servers are tested for compatibility with existing hardware and software by the Department to function as domain controllers in a critical support of Department’s Active Directory structure and as member servers supporting application, file sharing, and printing functions.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Hewlett Packard DL360 G4p and DL380 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.

GITM would also like the vendor to provide an estimated time of response and plan for escalation to the next level. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government¿s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State¿s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the APC Smart-UPS (part number and descriptions listed in paragraph 2). The use of an APC Smart-UPS is essential to the Government's requirement for server and network infrastructure power protection thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand at this time. The APC Smart-UPS has been identified as a key component of the Department¿s server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the uninterrupted power supply must be an APC Smart-UPS unit and provided by an APC reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the APC Smart-UPS rack mount server and network infrastructure uninterrupted power supply (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) as a key component of the Department's server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS power protection system works with existing hardware and software fielded in the unclassified and classified network to protect critical servers and data network infrastructure.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14


NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offeror’s must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.  
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms.  Offers shall be no more than 10 pages, less past performance and will be accepted via U.S. mail or electronically via email.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the offeror to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The National American Industry Classification Code is 334210 with a Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a requirement for a one-time, firm-fixed price purchase of the following equipment/supplies: 1) Harris Corporation Part Number IX-ACS-163-A1C, ACS T1 Mux AC100 RJ45 – Quantity (6); 2) Harris Corporation Part Number IX-PSY100AC, Power Supply Y-Series 100W AC – Quantity (6); 3) Harris Corporation Part Number IX-PTR-255, 6.722 Audio Card – Quantity (37); 4) Harris Corporation Part Number IX-MA-555, Audio Interface Card – Quantity (37); 5) Harris Corporation Part Number IX-D5-64NC, NX64 Data Card – Quantity (2); 6) Harris Corporation Part Number IX-MA-427, Ethernet Adapter Card – Quantity (2): One year labor and parts warranty. Minimum salient characteristics are as follows: 1. Needs to have dual 100 watt power supplies which allow for the load to be split evenly between two power supplies for higher efficiency and in the event one power supply fails the other could carry the full load. 2. Needs to utilize the G.722 Audio encoding standard which utilizes a form of Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation optimized for speech. G.722 allows transmissions from 30 Hertz (Hz) to 7 KHz with a 4:1 reduction ratio.  3. Needs to have Ethernet adapter/data cards which allow assignment of an IP address to the Multiplexer unit for remote access. 4. All channel cards must be completely configurable manually without the need for software. This dramatically reduces the re-configuration/troubleshooting time for technicians in the field.  Unless visibly marked that the vendor is quoting an equal product, the offered items shall be considered the brand name product as referenced in this announcement.  If offering an “or equal” product, the brand name of the product furnished shall be clearly identified on the quote.  The evaluation of quotes and the determination as to the equality of the product shall be the responsibility of the Government and shall be based on information provided by the vendor.  The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information not identified in the quotation and reasonably available to the purchasing activity.  All compliant quotes received by the due date will be considered by the government.  All quotes must identify FOB Destination, Quantico, VA and must include any shipping charges and the delivery time period.  Delivery will be to the Engineering Research Facility, Quantico, VA  22135.  All quotes shall be submitted to the Newington Annex, 8540 Terminal Rd., Lorton, VA  22079, Attn: Charlie Weschler, no later than 12:00 PM, EST, 7 August 2006. No hand carried responses will be accepted. Fax quotes will be accepted at (703) 339-2760. Quotes must clearly be marked with RFQ-E003051.  Bidders are hereby notified that if your quote is not received by the date/time and location specified in this announcement, it will not be considered.  As prescribed in FAR 12.301 (b) (2), an offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of the 52.212-3 provision, if they have successfully completed the annual representations and certifications via the online website at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Otherwise, offerors are to include a complete copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with their offer.  Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is applicable.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Addendum to 52.212-1 Modify: (b) Submission from offer(s) is to read as follows: Submit signed and dated offer(s) to the attention of Mr. Charles A. Weschler, Contracting Officer, at FBI, RFQ-E003051, Newington Annex, 8540 Terminal Rd., Lorton, VA  22079.  At clause 52.212-4, add 52.233-2 Service of Protest (AUG 1996), Department of Justice (DOJ), Justice Acquisition Regulation (JAR) Clauses, 2852.233-70 Protest Filed Directly with the Department of Justice (JAN 1998), and 2852.201-70 Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR)(JAN 1985), Mr. Anthony Baumann, Chief Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 935 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20535-0001 shall serve as the FBI’s contact in accordance with 52.233-3 Protest After Award. Additional Clause(s) that apply to this RFQ are 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999). The Government will award a contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers (i) technical, (ii) warranty, (iii) past performance, and (iv) price.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate technical compliance and make a best value decision.  This could result in award to other than the lowest price offer.  The areas of technical capability, warranty and past performance are of significantly higher importance when compared to price.  The technical evaluation will consist of reviewing and evaluating the “or equal” literature for compliance with meeting or exceeding Brand Name specifications.  If the Offeror fails to provide the descriptive literature as requested, it shall be grounds for disqualifying the offer.  Warranty – The offeror exceeding the standard commercial warranty, and offering the government the best value shall be rated higher.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1010487, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Thomas Billy of International Food Safety Consulting LLC under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to Food Safety Consulting LLC4802 Chevy Chase Blvd, Chevy Chase, MD 20815-5340.  There is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  Due to uncontrollable circumstances the contractor was not able to complete the work.  Continuing the services of Mr. Billy under this contract enables FDA to have ready access to an individual who is widely recognized as an expert in Food Safety and, more importantly methylmercury.   The potential health affects of methymercury in children and pregnant women is of great concern, and a high priority issue with members of Congress and the American people.  FDA needs the consistency of interaction between Mr. Billy and the stakeholders to ensure completion and any subsequent revision to reports.  Tom Billy is an internationally recognized leader in evaluating and managing food safety issues.  This expertise includes a detailed knowledge of seafood hazards and controls and the issue of methylmercury in particular; food safety risk assessment and analysis; and food safety risk management and communication strategies from both a national and international perspective.  His knowledge of, and experience in, these matters covers a broad spectrum that is important to this contract, in that he possesses a special understanding of all components of the food safety community both within and outside of the U.S. Federal government, including the international community, and has earned their respect.  Mr. Billy began his Federal career in fisheries research.  From 1974 to 1991 he served first as the Director of the Seafood Safety and Inspection Division of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce, then as that agency’s Director of Utilization Research and Inspection, and finally as the Deputy Director of the Office of Trade and Industry Services.   During this period he led efforts to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment on methylmercury in seafood and submit a petition to modify the FDA action level based upon this scientific analysis.  
In 1991 he was recruited to serve as the first director of FDA’s Office of Seafood.  A recognized seafood expert, he led efforts to develop an innovative HACCP program to improve seafood safety and served as the U.S. delegate to the Codex Alimentarius Committee on Fish and Fishery Products.   From 1994-1996, Mr. Billy served as Associate Administrator for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  He led the design and development of innovative program changes needed to improve the safety of meat and poultry products.  From 1996 to 2001, Mr. Billy served as Administrator for FSIS.  In this position he was leader of USDA’s food safety activities and managed an agency of 10,000 employees with an $800 million budget.  Mr. Billy’s efforts resulted in his receiving the 1997 Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Federal Executives.  He has also received two FDA Commissioner’s Special Citations.  Mr. Billy also was elected to serve two two-year terms as the Chairman of Codex Alimentarius.  As Chairman, Mr. Billy developed and gained support from the 168 members of the Codex Commission for strategies to strengthen the scientific basis for its work and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Codex, thus positioning it to address emerging food safety issues in the 21st century.  To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Billy is the only person qualified to lead the evaluations and develop the options called for in this contract in such a short time frame.   During his 39 year Federal career, Mr. Billy has gained leadership, policy, analytical, and communication skills that are needed to carry out this difficult task.  His particular knowledge of seafood safety and methylmercury in particular further strengthens his value in this effort.  His historical perspective on national and international issues related to this contract makes him uniquely qualified to accomplish the task required.  Also, Mr. Billy’s reputation and stature in the food safety community, both domestic and international, provide a degree of credibility and reassurance to stakeholders that would be difficult to duplicate and might not otherwise be readily obtainable for this project. These reasons, considered in their entirety, are why FDA anticipates a sole source award to Tom Billy of International Food Safety Consulting LLC, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 541710 –Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The following are objectives and tasks International Food Safety Consulting LLC will be requested to provide:  
Project Title:   Request Expert Services for Risk/Benefit Evaluation of Seafood Relating to Methylmercury in Commercial Fish.  Objective:  To perform risk/benefit evaluation(s) of commercial seafood that focus on the risk of methylmercury as weighed against nutritional and other health benefits, and provide options, including a preferred option where appropriate, for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration in light of the latest scientific, technical, and economic data and information.  These options will be made for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration about actions to be taken, if any, on the basis of this analysis and discussions and input from all stakeholders, giving due consideration to FDA’s broad responsibilities under the FD&C and PHS Acts.   Background:   Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that can have pronounced adverse effects in humans at very high doses.  These effects have been seen in extreme poisoning events as a result of industrial spills in Japan and Iraq.  In the United States, the primary exposure to methylmercury is generally regarded to be through the consumption of fish. Almost all fish have at least trace amounts of methylmercury.  Historically, the public health questions surrounding methylmercury have involved determining exposure through fish consumption over time that would be necessary to cause an adverse effect.  The degree of exposure is dependent on both the type and amount of fish consumed.  Public health actions, both in the United States and elsewhere, have focused on the development of “tolerable daily intake” levels for human exposure, regulatory limits, e.g., “action levels,” for the amount of methylmercury that would be allowed in fish, and consumer advisories recommending upper limits on fish consumption both in terms of amounts and types.  Fish have always been considered a good source of nutrition, but more recently, questions have been raised about potential health consequences of not consuming, or substantially limiting the consumption of, seafood.  Many of these questions derive from data about the beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish and other potentially positive nutritional characteristics of fish.  The recently revised consumer advisory on methylmercury emphasized the benefits of consuming fish but did not involve either a quantitative or qualitative assessment of the risks from mercury exposure versus the benefits of eating fish.  Scope of Work:  In cooperation with the Office of Seafood, and with the assistance of the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, the Chief Medical Officer, FDA staff, EPA, other federal agencies, and other stakeholders, as needed, the contractor shall:  1.  Conduct a new risk evaluation that takes into account all data and all previous assessments including the recent assessment by JECFA.  2.  Conduct a benefits evaluation of seafood in the diet that includes but is not necessarily limited to:  literature search, and analysis to the extent practicable of known and potential nutritional and other health benefits from seafood consumption and estimates of lost benefits and/or public health harm from dietary changes in seafood consumption, if any.    3.  Risk and benefit papers will be peer – reviewed under FDA auspices consistent with guidelines to meet FDA and OMB requirements.  4.  Coordinate contract work with the NAS/IOM Study on “Nutrient Relationships in Seafood: Selections to Balance Benefits and Risks” – participating in public meetings, make available the peer – reviewed Risk and Benefit papers and any modeling tools developed to the study.  5.  Provide options, including a preferred option where appropriate, to FDA for changes, if any, on the basis of the above evaluation(s).  Among other things, these options may relate to the consumer advisory, the action level, and consumer education.  6.  Conduct meetings with “stakeholders” in other Federal agencies, consumer advocacy organizations, industry, academia/scientific community, etc. on the purposes and scope of the work, the work itself, and gain their views and understanding.  7.  Conduct at least two public meetings, announced in the Federal Register, and conducted to share new data and information and to obtain oral and/or written input.  One or more of these public meetings may be held with NAS.  8.  Meet with agency, HHS, and other federal agency representatives on a regular basis to discuss the status of the project.  9.  Prepare briefing materials and provide support to the agency as needed.  10.  Provide advice associated with consumer studies by participation in the Technical Advisory Group. There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates. Support to be Provided by FDA:   adequate scientific technical support for research, risk and benefit assessment modeling, drafting, etc.; adequate office space, appropriately provisioned, e.g., desk, telephone, computer, in College Park for the duration of the contract.  Scientific technical support may be augmented by staff from EPA and other government agencies, where appropriate.  Period of performance is one year from date of award.

PRICE BID SUBMISSION The Bidders Price Offer shall reflect a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contractual effort.  For the FFP requirements a breakdown of cost data is not required under this solicitation because the Contracting Officer anticipates adequate price competition.  How ever, in the event that the Contracting Officer subsequently determines that price competition is inadequate for this acquisition, detailed cost data may then be requested in compliance with law and regulations. Required Files Bidders shall input bids into the attached pricing spreadsheet, which is attachment 006 of this solicitation.  Instruction for data input is provided in the spreadsheet.  Caution Attachment 006 must be completed and submitted with pricing information.  In addition, bidders shall complete and submitted an electronic online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA can be found at http://orcas.bpn.gov.  All files must be downloaded to the IBOP prior to Bid opening.  Basis for Award The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder(s) whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the solicitation for bids. The Government shall evaluate the Bidders proposed prices by comparison of proposed prices received from each Bidder in response to this solicitation. The evaluation will be based on adding the range quantity prices from spreadsheet, Attachment 006, (with weight factors applied to each range quantity). DETERMINATION OF EVALULATED UNIT PRICE FOR RANGE QUANTITIES: For evaluation purposes, the following formula will be utilized for calculating the Evaluated Unit Price for each CLIN/SLIN that has a range quantity: EVUP = (UP1 x MQR x WF1) + (UP2 x MQR2 x WF2) + (&.,) 		(MQR1 x WF1)  + (MQR2 x WF2) (&.,) EVUP = Evaluated Unit Price UP      = Bidders proposed Unit Price for each range quantity MQR = Maximum Quantity in each range WF     = Weight Factor for each range Explanation 1. Each bidders proposed Unit Price with range quantities will be multiplied by the Maximum Quantity in each range times the Weight Factor for that range to give a Weighted Range price. 2. The Weighted Range prices will then be added to determine a total weighted price. 3. The Maximum Quantities for each range will be multiplied by the corresponding Range Weight Factor and will be summed to determine a Weighted Range Quantity. 4. The Weighted range price from Step 2 will be divided by the Weighted Range Quantity from Step 3 to determine EVUP. 5. The Government Designated quantity for that CLIN/SLIN as shown will then be multiplied by the Evaluated Unit Price (Step 4) to arrive at a Total Evaluated price for that CLIN/SLIN. 6. This will be repeated for all CLIN/SLINs with ranges and added together to form the Governments Evaluated Price. 7. ***FOR EXAMPLE*** The designated quantity for each ranged CLIN is 3,000, 15,000 in total for all five CLINs. A hypothetical bid calculation for one CLIN is set forth below to illustrate how prices will be calculated under the formula: Step 1: - This is only an example - 	Sample Range QTY	Proposed Price for Range	Total Price for Range	Range Weight Factor	Weighted Range Price Range A	250  1,000	1,000 x $45	= $45,000	x .20	= $9,000 Range B	1,001  2,000	2,000 x $44	= $88,000	x .15	= $13,200 Range C	2,001  3,000	3,000 x $43	= $129,000	x .50	= $64,500 Range D	3,001  4,000	4,000 x $42	= $168,000	x .10	= $16,800 Range E	4,001  5,000	5,000 x $41	= $205,000	x .05	= $10,250 Step 2: Total Weighted Price = 						     $113,750 Step 3: Weighted Range Quantity: (1,000 x 0.2) + (2,000 x 0.15) + (3,000 x 0.5) + (4,000 x 0.10) + (5,0 00 x 0.05) = $2,650 Step 4: EVUP = $113,750/$2,650 = $42.924528 Step 5: Total Evaluated Price (for a designated quantity of 3,000): 3,000 x $42.92 = $128,773.58, rounded to $128,774 for this CLIN. NOTE: The price analysis shall consider whether bids are materially unbalanced. The Government may elect not to award to a bidder whose prices are materially unbalanced. A bid is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly overstated for  some work and significantly understated for other work.

GITM would also like the vendor to provide an estimated time of response and plan for escalation to the next level. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Cisco switches. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government¿s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State¿s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. The Cisco switches (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for GITM deployments and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of the APC Smart-UPS (part number and descriptions listed in paragraph 2). The use of an APC Smart-UPS is essential to the Government's requirement for server and network infrastructure power protection thereby precluding consideration of the products of another brand at this time. The APC Smart-UPS has been identified as a key component of the Department¿s server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. To ensure compatibility with existing hardware and software in the field, the uninterrupted power supply must be an APC Smart-UPS unit and provided by an APC reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the APC Smart-UPS rack mount server and network infrastructure uninterrupted power supply (part numbers and descriptions listed in paragraph 2) as a key component of the Department's server and network infrastructure power protection system. APC Smart-UPS power protection system works with existing hardware and software fielded in the unclassified and classified network to protect critical servers and data network infrastructure.

<DESC>Questions and Answers with Site Visit Remarks

1.  
Q. Clin 5) Is the fiber optic cable a 2 fiber instead of 2 conductor?
A. 6.25 MULTIMODE, FIBER (PVC, 2 FIBER, GREEN, RED, BLUE, YELLOW, GRAY, BLACK, PURPLE, PINK)
2. 
Q. You reference a eON 16 circuit analog line cord and a station (SLP) baby board.  Is the manufacturer eON?  Do you have an address or telephone number so we may contact them?  Also do you have part numbers for these items?
A.  eOn Communications Corporation
     4105 Royal Drive NW
     Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA
     800-955-5321
3.
Q. Do you have the qty of the 2 port wall plates?
A. Contractor should use the SOW and facility network diagram to yield the quantity of two port wall plates.
4.
Q. There appears to be some duplication of the Phone Items. Specifically, under Clin 4, Line Items 20, 21, 22 and 23 also appear under CLIN 5, Line Items 29, 30, 31 and 32.
A. CLIN 004 and CLIN 005 are very much alike but are for two different sides (rooms) of the vault project. When this was originally approached they were separate tasks but as the project continued to grow, this was combined under one task. Each room will still require all the necessary phone equipment to make the system work. The only real duplication is CLIN 004 item 23 and CLIN 005 item 32, it is now one 150 foot cable.
5.
Q.  The drawing shows a "Below Floor UPS Route". Is that part of this solicitation? If so what exactly are we doing with it? (possibly some of the cable tray might be for this purpose?)
A. UPS route is not part of the comm infrastructure project.
6. 
Q. Can you provide better a description, details or part numbers for the following CLINs:5-21, 5-22 and 5-26.
A.  See response to question # 3.
7. 
Q. Are there enough available vacant slots in the telephone equipment cabinet to accomodate the additional boards (CLIN 5-29 & 30), or will an expansion cabinet be required?
A. Expansion cabinet not required.
8. 
Q. There appears to be a discrepancy in the solicitation regarding the telephones. Are the new telephones to be SPEAKERPHONES or NON-SPEAKERPHONE?
A. NON_SPEAKERPHONE
9. 
Q. Can you provide an updated estimate on the amount of cable required? When amendment 1 added more cable and fiber optic, in additional colors, is this adding to the TOTAL cable length or is it simply changing the overall colors and length per color?
A. Amendment one reflects the addition of two more networks of different colors (fiber and copper). A single color bulk cable (fiber or copper) is unacceptable for this project.

e.	Facility Concerns:  The theater is old and may require unknown specifications; therefore a site survey will be required by the contractor before a proposal can be submitted to ensure accuracy of the proposal.
f.	Cabling/Termination:  All control, video, and composite cabling will run from the projector into the ceiling and across the ceiling to the backstage right control panel.  Any visible cabling will be run through conduit.  For audio/video source connection to the control unit, a wall plate shall be installed directly below center stage on the front skirt.  The customer will be able to connect into the wall plate with all video/audio components.  From the wall plate, cabling will be run under the stage to the control panel or audio rack as needed.  Three XLR inputs will be needed in the wall plate along with a video input and composite input.

<DESC>1.  Provided are answers to questions received regarding this quotation:

Q: In the solicitation HSCG40-06-Q-6TR001 it states that there will be 15-20 Green Belt participants and there will be 5 Black Belt participants.  Will the Black Belt candidates come from the original 15-20 Green Belt class?  Or is this in addition to the Green Belt class.  In order to obtain Black Belt status one must first posses a Green Belt.

A: Black Belts will come from the green belt pool.

Q:  The new requirements state Green Belt training for 7 and Black Belt training for 3.  Can I assume that the 3 are included in the 7 or are they 3 different people?  It's important because if they are 3 different people then they have to also attend the Green Belt class in our case.

A: The three come from the seven - however the new numbers are 5 black and 15 green (i.e. all 20 to be trained as green - 5 of those to black).

Q:  Is the use of Minitab or any other specific software necessary for the Black Belt program or can we choose what we use?

A: That is up to the vendor. 

Q:  The request does not indicate what kind of process improvement issues you are facing. Can you please outline what is driving the Engineering Logistics Center's desire for a process improvement program?  What are the objectives? 

A:Primarily the desire to take our quality improvements to 'the next level'. Identification and improvement of Critical to Quality variables. Implementation of more robust measurement and improvement methodologies. Improved understanding and use of statistical analysis.  Improve process yields. Maximizing return on improvements. 

Q: Have you already identified any specific problems or issues that need to be addressed? If so, please explain. 

A: We have selected 3 projects: Improving a reverse logistics process (called MTI for mandatory turn in), Improving the process for officer evaluations, and improving CTQs related to our customer facing websites. The last project is probably the weakest in terms of adequacy for Six Sigma. Good data exists for the first two.  

Q:  The request states that the Engineering Logistics Center is interested in training 15 Green Belts and 5 Black Belts. Have the specific participants already been identified. Either way, can you please describe what kind of backgrounds these people have and what roles they play within the organization? 

A:They have been identified. Mid to senior level people all with some background in quality improvement (primarily TQM and ISO 9001:2000). All should have good exposure to the 'soft' skills in managing improvement projects (like team facilitation). Most trainees will be weaker in statistical analysis. All will have worked on improvement teams before - but generally not at the level of depth required by Six Sigma.

Q: Are these numbers (15 GBs and 5 BBs) absolute? Is there any chance that you would include more or fewer people at either level? 

A: More is ok - less might be a problem.

Q: Will the participants be in a position to bring real projects to the training sessions? (The alternative is that we would just use case studies and examples.) 

A: We have 3 black belt projects selected - we had initially contemplated dividing the training group into 3 teams with each team working on a black belt project, since we are now requesting 5 black belts we would need to provide 2 more projects for that approach. Green belt candidates would work as assistants on the black belt projects. This approach is not required - we are open to other approaches that vendors find to be effective. Case studies or vendor provided 'projects' are acceptable.

Q:  The request indicates that Certification should be included in the program. The definition of Certification varies widely in the Six Sigma industry. Some organizations (both vendors and users) define Certification as passing a written examination. Others require not only a written exam, but successful completion of an actual project (to be reviewed by a Certifying Expert or Board). What is the Engineering Logistics Center's definition of "Certification?" 

A:  Exams and projects are beneficial but not absolutely required. Vendors should define what certification means to them and sell us the benefits of their approach. The American society of quality's body of knowledge for six sigma is a useful guide but adhering to every point of it is not required. For certification vendor will need to state that each person that successfully completes the training is competent in each of the knowledge areas vendor proposes to provide training in.

Q: Black Belt training includes instruction in statistical analysis methods using statistical software (such as Minitab or JMP). Does the Engineering Logistics Center already use one of these programs and/or do you have a preference for one of them? 

A: We have no preference - we do not currently own these tools. 

Q: Is the Engineering Logistics Center considering any Leadership and/or Champion training? Are you interested in information about this kind of service? 

A: No 

Q:Is there an incumbent or preferred vendor already in place for the requested training?

A: No 

Q: What is the current issue(s) that the Coast Guard is attempting to address via Lean Six Sigma? 

A: Identification and improvement of Critical to Quality variables. Implementation of more robust measurement and improvement methodologies. Improved understanding of statistical analysis.  Improve process yields. Maximizing return on improvements.

Q: How is the Coast Guard handling the related elements of this deployment outside of the training? e.g, project selection, Deployment champion, project sponsor training?

A: This has already been done. 

Q: How will/are projects being selected for the Green Belt and Black Belt training?  How were these arrived at? 

A: Our quality management boards evaluated their current work and selected the projects they though best met the scope of a six sigma project. Each project has a charter stating the business case and desired outcomes. 

2.  As of this date, no further questions will be allowed.

3.  The due date for Quotations remains 7 August 2006 at 2:00 local time.

<DESC>The following questions and answers are provided for informational purposes only: Question #1:  Are the dimensions referenced in the solicitation absolute or is there some flexibility in the enclosure sizes?  If there is some flexibility, can the enclosure size be expressed in 'not to exceed' dimensions? Answer #1:  Chamber sizes are absolute in order to maximize our research space Question #2:  Given the precise temperature / humidity control desired across the 4 - 40 deg C operating range, does the user envision this chamber to be 'air tight'?    If so, is there a need / concern for barometric pressure compensation?    Answer #2:  No.  The chambers are not required to be air tight.  Barometric pressure compensation is not required. Question #3:  The specification makes reference to a 'highly corrosive environment'; is this corrosive element inside or outside the chamber?   Are there any other known material sensitivity which should be considered (i.e. - rubber door seals, etc..)?    Can the user provide a description of the environment in which the chambers are to function (i.e. - min / max temp., humidity, etc..) Answer #3:  The main corrosive will be salt corrosion from seawater.  Exposure will occur on both the inside and outside of the chambers.  Min/max temps and humidity ranges are provided in the specifications but normal operation will generally be at an ave rage temperature of ~23°C at maximum humidity. Question #4:  Are there any particular needs re. door(s) size?   Sealing?  Window size? Internal release mechanism for lock? Answer #4:  The door should be a single door with a mimimum 36 in. width.  Window size should be a minimum of 1 foot square.  Question #5:  Reference is made that power shall be 208 VAC:   is this single or multi-phase power?    Is there a max current demand specified? Answer #5:  The console power can be up to 20 amp (120/208 volts) single or three phase. Condenser power can be up to 30 amps (120/208 volts) single or three phase Question #6: Given the desire for both expansion capability and individual multi-day chamber programmability, would the user consider the possibility of utilizing individual PC-based data acquisition and control systems for each chamber?  These individual PCs could then be linked via a LAN-network to consolidate test reports, etc... Answer #6:  Yes.  This is feasible although an integrated computer for each chamber would be desirable. Question #7:  The specification makes reference to a capability to accept new sensors; can the user specify the types of data which are to be captured and displayed in addition to / as a function of temperature & humidity? Answer #7:  This is an uncertain at this point.  4-20 mA sensor support is desirable.    Question #8: What, if any, system or component calibration shall be required?   Shall this calibration routine be automated? Answer #8:  If system calibration is required then an automated system would be desirable. Question #9:  Rather than internally-mounted lighting, would externally-mounted lights over windows in the roof be acceptable? Answer #9:  Internally lighting is desired but external lights should work if they can be fit within the ~2' clearance above the chamber. Question #10:  Are there any particular needs relating to the chamber 110 VAC outlets (i.e. - more than 20 A?; Hazard-rated or explosion-proof?)   Are there any other internal chamber needs?  Sampling probes?   Thermo-couples?  Answer #10:  115-120V/20 amp circuits are the only requirement. Question #11:  Is there any site visit and /or direct interaction with the user community planned / possible before the award date? Answer #11:  A site visit prior to the award date can be arranged by contacting J. Daniel Farrar at 601-634-2118 or by e-mail at farrarj2@wes.army.mil. Question #12:  Are there any plans available showing location of the rooms and the condensing units?  A nswer #12:  A drawing of the lab is available by contacting Anitra Wilson at Anitra.D.Wilson@mvk02.usace.army.mil or 601-631-5341. The drawing was done for internal discussion only so it is not exactly to scale although indicated measurements are generally  correct.  Each square represents roughly 1 foot. Question#13: The chambers are specified to include a door with a window and locking handle.  Is there a minimum or maximum size for this door? Answer #13:  Minimum width is 36 inches.
