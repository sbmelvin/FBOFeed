<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  The development of capillary neutron optics permits a new technology for neutron capture therapy involving the application of a focused thermal neutron beam at the medically optimal location within the patient.  A subthermal neutron beam begins to converge as it travels through a neutron "lens," reaching a narrow focus within a tube that allows it to pass directly to the treatment region. This technique results in a substantially lower dose to untreated parts of the patient and a substantially weaker radiation field in the treatment room generally. Additional advantages include the relative ease of thermal neutron generation and the ability to shield the patient completely and effectively from fast neutrons or gamma rays originating at the neutron source.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively  award a contract.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE  CARFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL  BE ISSUED.  The Minerals Management Service, as  mandated by the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands  Act (as amended) pursuant to the Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR) 250, has been delegated the  mission to manage OCS oil and gas resources. As an  integral part of implementing the OCS Lands Act, MMS  conducts environmental reviews and prepares  environmental documents such as environmental impact  statements (EISs) and environmental assessments  (EAs) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy  Act (NEPA; Public Law 91-190) on MMS Pacific OCS  Region (POCSR) post-lease oil and gas projects prior  to startup of project operations. During the past  decades, the POCSR issued permits for numerous post- lease oil and gas projects.  Many of the  environmental documents developed for those projects  required environmental mitigation measures and  associated permit conditions in decision documents  (e.g., Records of Decision and approval letters)  before issuance of the appropriate operating  permits. The proposed study would help MMS evaluate  environmental mitigation effectiveness of measures  and conditions for offshore oil and gas projects.  Thus, the study results would be used to determine  the most feasible methods of preserving and  protecting the quality of the human, marine, and  coastal environments for OCS oil and gas activities  in the Pacific Region, specifically offshore Santa  Barbara Channel and Santa Maria Basin, California.   The Offeror shall provide the necessary personnel,  facilities, and services required for the successful  performance and completion of the study objectives  set forth herein.  Study Objective 1: Conduct  Environmental Mitigation Monitoring of Current and  Future Post-Lease Oil and Gas Projects - The  Contractor  shall observe, sample, and/or monitor  environmental field conditions to test mitigation of  current and future post-lease oil and gas projects  as directed by MMS and to provide information to  MMS.  The type of data to be collected (after  consultation with MMS) would depend on factors such  as (1) site-specific concerns related to  environmental mitigation monitoring of current and  future post-lease projects requiring additional  information in the form of studies and monitoring  and (2) the Contractor's recommendations for  sampling and monitoring based on contemporary  environmental issues relevant to Pacific OCS oil &  gas projects.  The proposed studies and monitoring  to be conducted by the Contractor would be  considered short-term (ranging from a few days to  months).  The focus of the above is the development  and implementation of environmental mitigation  monitoring/investigations and studies.  As a  requirement in the RFP interested parties will be  requested to submit a capability statement which  must demonstrate that both your organization and  proposed key personnel can successfully complete  this project and must include a list of references  for projects completed by the proposed project team  and your organization to determine your potential  for success and contract award.  The capability  statement, past performance references and personnel  qualifications will be evaluated to establish a list  of qualifying competitors.  Only those offeror's  demonstrating an ability to successfully perform  this project will be asked to submit a written  presentation summary and project management plan.

(c)  If the first article is disapproved, the Contractor, upon Government request, shall submit an additional first article for testing.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a purchase order to TMA, Incorporated (TMA) to maintain the FHWA Deep Foundations Load Test Database (DFLTD).  The FHWA plans to award a purchase order to TMA to bring the Internet ready data maintenance application online and to maintain the database thereafter.  TMA will review any data associated with the database and input data into the database.  TMA is thoroughly familiar with the FHWAs deep foundation database and their personnel wrote the current Internet data maintenance modulue, they are the only known source that can provide these services to FHWA. Because TMA has written data transfer applications transferring data from disparate source into the DFLTD, it is imperative that the FHWA contracts with TMA.  No other source possesses the knowledge and experience required to successfully maintain the FHWA DFLTD.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about April 4, 2002.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation 200-2002-0376 is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ). RFQ 200-2002-0376 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)97-24.

	The Toxicology Branch (TB) of the Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS), NCEH performs research and development projects intended to help understand the amount of chemicals that get into people, the mechanisms and activities through which chemicals get into people, confounding circumstances that can affect the amount of chemicals that get into people, whether disease results from exposure, if there are groups that are particularly susceptible to exposure, and whether interventions reduce exposure and are effective in preventing morbidity and mortality.  The methods to accomplish these projects involve advanced mass spectrometry measurements of trace levels of chemicals or their metabolites.  In order to achieve the necessary sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, and precision, labeled isotopes are typically used as reference compounds for these measurements.  Many of these compounds will have to be custom-made in accordance with our requirements.
	
The objectives for the Toxicology Labeled Chemical Project are:   A)  To synthesize for TB/DLS sufficient quantities of the pure labeled standards so that methods can be developed and carried out using these compounds as reference.  B)  To provide documented evidence of the labeled standards purity and identity.  Thus, independently, and not as an agent of the government, the awardee shall provide to the CDC the following chemical species which shall be at least 98% isotopically and chemically pure:

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for one each Velocity Laser System p/n 6328-P.  This system shall have a high wavelength stability/repeatability (&lt;0.1 nm); fast modulation option (fine-frequency modulation bandwidth 2 KHz and current modulation bandwidth 100 MHz); broad tuning range of 1510-1580 nm. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from  New Focus, Inc. 5215 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, CA.  This Velocity Laser System is for use in the CO2 sounder to provide a seed laser for an Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier.  The high wavelength stability/repeatability is essential in maintaining the fidelity of the CO2 sounder measurements.  The fast modulation option will simplify the system and improve the ability to generate pulsed engery from the CW laser.  The wavelength tunability has a borad tuning range which is essential to spectroscopy experiments.  No other Laser System is available that can pump Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier and meet the required specifications.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 9, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Commerce Business Daily Announcement

United States Customs Service
P-3 Airborne Early Warning (AEW) Aircraft

APS-145 Retrofit Program


Introduction

The United States Customs Service (USCS) currently operates six P-3 AEW aircraft from the Surveillance Support Branches, located at NAS Corpus Christi, TX and NAS Jacksonville, FL, in the performance of its drug interdiction mission.  The P-3 AEW #1-4 aircraft use the APS-138 search radar while AEW #5 and 6 use the updated APS-145 radar with an updated mission processing and display system.  An additional two AEW aircraft (#7/8) are now being modified from US Navy heavyweight P-3B airframes into an updated configuration, which again uses the APS-145 radar but also includes new digital cockpit avionics and a dual channel digital replacement autopilot.  USCS has received funding from a Congressional appropriation for Plan Colombia to retrofit AEW #1-4 aircraft to an AEW #7 configuration. 

Objective

USCS intends to competitively award a modification contract for the retrofit of P-3 AEW #1-4 to the AEW #7 configuration.  Industry is strongly encouraged to review the draft Statement of Work (SOW) - available on request, to gain a thorough understanding of the scope of this effort.  USCS anticipates issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the retrofit modification contract in March 2001, with receipt of price proposal submissions 30 days after release of the RFP.

Work Scope - General

The AEW retrofit work scope requires offerors with full in-house engineering, manufacturing and testing capability.  Offerors must have extensive experience in the modification, rework and overhaul of P-3B airframes and/or demonstrated expertise in modifying other large multi-engine aircraft.  Such modification experience will include the installation and testing of sophisticated radar, IFF, digital avionics, autopilot, communications, computer processing and display equipment.  Commonality with the AEW #7 configuration is a key objective of this effort.  Major tasks for this effort include:  a) Program management, quality assurance, planning and control; b) generation of engineering removal and installation drawings specific to this effort, which are not otherwise provided in the government-furnished technical data package;  c) procurement or fabrication of all installation materials, wiring harnesses and equipment not provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE); d) installation of all retrofit materials and equipment, both CFE and GFE, new and modified/original, in AEW #1-4; e) performance of ground and flight testing for the finished product.
3.1	Airframe and Aircraft Sub-systems

3.1.1	Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance

Firms responding to the RFP should indicate their capabilities to perform routine P-3B airframe organizational level maintenance procedures to support the aircraft during modification and flight test.  Phased depot maintenance (PDM) will not be part of this retrofit modification contract.  However, limited corrosion and other airframe/sub-system problems discovered during the normal course of the retrofit process will be addressed on a case by case basis.  Firms should describe their relevant experience to perform such work in their offers.  Only this portion of the work will be priced on a time and materials basis.

3.1.2	Airframe Configuration

The internal/external configuration of the aircraft following retrofit will match AEW #7 in all respects, with the exception of differences required for the AEW #3 LWB airframe.  The required tasks include, but are not limited to, the following areas:  a) ballast amount and positioning to achieve proper weight and balance; b) internal arrangement of work benches, seating and crew rest areas; c) equipment bay layout and positioning of avionics hardware and wiring runs; d) external aircraft arrangement of antennas including SATCOM antenna mounted on (existing) rotodome; e) internal cosmetic appearance to include necessary replaces; g) AEW #7 configuration for the Intercommunication System (ICS) Crew Station Units (CSU) operator interface and Communications Control Unit (CCU) software; h) data transfer capability via MILSATCOM.  The new communications equipment will be GFE.

3.4	Cockpit Avionics

The cockpit avionics will be updated using a government-furnished flat panel Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), Flight Management System (FMS) with GPS and associated control panels/CDU.  The PB-20N single channel analog autopilot will be replaced with a dual channel digital autopilot.  The electromechanical engine/gearbox instruments will be replaced with a digital Engine Instrument Display System (EIDS).  Additional replacement GFE systems to be installed include: a) dual VIR-432; b) dual DME-442; c) dual ADS-3000 air data systems; d) ALT-4000 radar altimeter; and e) GH-3000/ADC-3000 standby instrument system.  The existing dual Litton 92 (LTN-92) Inertial Navigation System (INS) will be retained, however the LTN-92 2001 GPS and CDU's will be removed.  The existing weather radar (TWR-850) and ADF-462 will be retained with some minor changes, to be completed by the successful offeror, including control and display through the FMS/EFIS.

Program Schedule

USCS is in the process of determining an induction and delivery schedule for the retrofit program.  The preliminary schedule would have modifications commence with the first aircraft induction in the fall of 2001 and would be followed at approximately 4 month intervals for the remaining 3 aircraft.  Each aircraft will be in modification and test for 6-8 months, and USCS estimates the duration of the entire program will be 18 months.  Aircraft modification schedule is subject to change due to  a variety of factors including GFE delivery dates and operational mission requirements.

Government Furnished Equipment

USCS anticipates providing the majority of the equipment required for the retrofit as GFE.  This will facilitate meeting the program schedule for aircraft induction outlined above while allowing sufficient lead time for GFE delivery.  A number of aircraft systems will be retained as is, while some will be removed, modified and reinstalled.  The new GFE purchases now being acquired by USCS include: a) APS-145 kits; b) cockpit avionics including EFIS, FMS, autopilot, air data, EIDS, radio navigation; c) mission system hardware including tactical/Q-70 displays workstations, mission computer, track processor chassis; d) communications radios and CDUs.  USCS intends to deliver GFE to the modification contractor in late 2001 or early 2002 for the first two aircraft and by mid-2002 for the second two aircraft.

Technical Data Package  and  AEW Aircraft Inspection

Upon request, USCS intends to distribute an electronic technical data package to firms interested in responding to the RFP.  This package will include AEW #1-4 drawings and a digital photo library of the existing aircraft configuration.  The AEW #7 configuration will be documented by a 90% engineering design release drawing package, draft specifications and a digital photo library.  USCS anticipates having final AEW #7 drawings and specifications available in the summer of 2001, prior to the induction of the first (AEW #1-4) retrofit aircraft.  USCS also anticipates that AEW #7 will be available for inspection in the later portion of the summer of 2001, before the first retrofit aircraft induction.  USCS will not warrant the technical data package as "build-to" data, nor will it warrant the data for overall accuracy or completeness.  Each aircraft will vary to some degree as to its current configuration, upon delivery to the modification contractor.  Minor system / airframe deviations between aircraft and technical data / drawings can be expected and shall not be considered a basis to file an additional over and above claim against the Government.  Contracting of any outside technical support services required to carry out this retrofit effort will be the responsibility of the successful offeror.

USCS will make several AEW airframes available for offeror walk-through inspections in conjunction with the release of the RFP.  At this time USCS anticipates that P-3 AEW #1 and #2 will be made available for inspection between March 14 and 16 at the Surveillance Support Branch in Corpus Christi, Texas.  Individual walk through inspections will be scheduled by the Contracting Officer and will allow each vendor several hours to privately inspect the airframes, take pictures, etc.  Appointment requests should be forwarded via email to the Contracting Officer listed below in Section 7.0.

7.0	Contractual Arrangements

USCS does not desire and will not consider technical proposals.  USCS will use an oral interview process to determine each firm's understanding of the statement of work.  The technical evaluation will emphasize past performance and experience.  The contract type will be firm fixed price and will also include an optional time and material / reimbursable CLIN for repair efforts as described in Section 3.1.1 above.  Interested firms are encouraged to respond via email to the Contracting Officer, Sharon Lim, at:   "sharon.lim@customs.treas.gov" or alternately via phone at (202) 927-4914.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for services in support of its Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) to find data and, when necessary, perform experiments and analysis to add such data to the NIST MS Database.  The specific areas for which the MSDC is seeking data are in the areas of medically relevant compounds (both volatile and nonvolatile), pesticides, metabolic by-products, drug candidate compounds, new drugs of abuse, and performance enhancing drugs.  For each of these areas, data is sought for both the pure compound when volatile and the derivatized compounds when not. The specific derivatized compounds are the trimethylsilyl derivatives (TMS), the tertbutylldimethylsilyl derivatives (TBDMS) and the methyl derivatives (Me).  The data, so developed, should aid in the identification not only of the compounds specifically examined in these experiments, but also in the development of algorithms for the identification of classes of compounds in complex mixtures.  This is a small-business set-aside, NAICS Code 541710, size standard of 500 employees. The contract will be for a base year and 2 option years.  All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov. 
The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about April 4, 2002 and will only be available on FEDBIZOPS at the above website.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored and no bidder lists will be maintained.  Potential offerors are required to direct all questions via email to marsha.rodgers@nist.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) seeks strong, responsive proposals from well-qualified sources to develop information technologies to help prevent continued terrorist attacks on the citizens, institutions, and property of the United States and its allies. Program efforts are intended mainly to provide a series of increasingly powerful leave-behind prototypes with a limited number of proof-of-concept demonstrations in extremely high risk, high payoff areas. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS: I) Repository Technologies, II) Collaboration, Automation and Cognitive Aids technologies, and III) Prototype System technologies. Offerors wishing to perform work in more than one topic area must submit separate proposals for each area of interest. 
OBJECTIVES: 1) Development of revolutionary technology for ultra-large all-source information repositories and associated privacy protection technologies; 2) Development of collaboration, automation, and cognitive aids technologies that allow humans and machines to think together about complicated and complex problems more efficiently and effectively; and 3) Development and implementation of an end-to-end, closed-loop prototype system to aid in countering terrorism through prevention by integrating technology and components from existing DARPA programs such as: Genoa, EELD (Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery), WAE (Wargaming the Asymmetric Environment), TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization), HID (Human Identification at Distance), Bio-Surveillance; as well as programs resulting from the first two areas of this BAA and other programs. REPOSITORY ISSUES: The National Security Community has a need for very large scale databases covering comprehensive information about all potential terrorist threats; those who are planning, supporting or preparing to carry out such events; potential plans; and potential targets. In the context of this BAA, the term ?database? is intended to convey a new kind of extremely large, omni-media, virtually-centralized, and semantically-rich information repository that is not constrained by today?s limited commercial database products -- we use ?database? for lack of a more descriptive term. DARPA seeks innovative technologies needed to architect, populate, and exploit such a database for combating terrorism. Key metrics include the amount of total information that is potentially covered, the utility of its data structures for data entry and use by humans and machines in searching and browsing, data integration, and capability to automatically populate, and the completeness, correctness, and timeliness of the information when used for predictive analysis and modeling in exploiting the information in these repositories. It is anticipated this will require revolutionary new technology. The database envisioned is of an unprecedented scale, will most likely be distributed, must be capable of being continuously updated, and must support both autonomous and semi-automated analysis. The latter requirement implies that the representation used must, to the greatest extent possible, be interpretable by both algorithms and human analysts. The database must support change detection and be able to execute automated procedures implied by new information. Because of expected growth and adaptation needs, the effective schema must be adaptable by the user so that as new sources of information, analytical methods, or representations arise, the representation of data may be re-structured without great cost. If distributed, the database may require new search methods to answer complex, less than specific queries across physical implementations and new automated methods for maintaining consistency. The reduced signature and misinformation introduced by terrorists who are attempting to hide and deceive imply that uncertainty must be represented in some way. To protect the privacy of individuals not affiliated with terrorism, DARPA seeks technologies for controlling automated search and exploitation algorithms and for purging data structures appropriately. Business rules are required to enforce security policy and views appropriate for the viewer's role. The potential sources of information about possible terrorist activities will include extensive existing databases. Innovative technologies are sought for treating these databases as a virtual, centralized, grand database. This will require technologies for automatically determining schemas, access methods and controls, and translation of complex English language queries into the appropriate language for the relevant databases. DARPA currently has on-going research programs aimed at language translation, information extraction from text, and multi-modal biometric technologies. These component technologies will be used to feed the Information Awareness database but must be augmented by other technologies and new sources of information to dramatically increase the coverage of counter-terrorism information. These other technologies include but are not limited to innovative new methods of database integration, structured information authoring, and exploitation of integrated data streams. Non-traditional methods of identifying and monitoring terrorist activity are anticipated. Populating a database with information derived from masked or deceptive behavior by an adversary is a challenging technical problem. DARPA invites new ideas for novel information sources and methods that amplify terrorist signatures and enable appropriate response. COLLABORATION, AUTOMATION AND COGNITIVE AIDS ISSUES: DARPA will be developing technology to support collaborative work by cross-organizational teams of intelligence and policy analysts and operators as they develop models and simulations to aid in understanding the terrorist threat, generate a complete set of plausible alternative futures, and produce options to deal proactively with these threats and scenarios. The challenges such teams face include the need to work faster, overcome human cognitive limitations and biases when attempting to understand complicated, complex, and uncertain situations, deal with deliberate deception, create explanations and options that are persuasive for the decision maker, break down the information and procedural stovepipes that existing organizations have built, harness diversity as a tool to deal with complexity and uncertainty, and automate that which can effectively be accomplished by machines so that people have more time for analysis and thinking. Emphasis needs to be placed on ease of use, adaptation to the user who is often not a scientist or engineer, and implicit encouragement to use the tools to make the users? tasks easier. DARPA is seeking innovative technology for automating some of the team processes; augmenting the human intellect via tools that assist teams thinking together, tools that do some of the thinking for people, and tools that support human/machine collaboration in the cognitive domain; and for providing a rich environment for collaboration across existing hierarchical organizations while maintaining the necessary accountability and control. DARPA envisions that the human teams using its system will be drawn from multiple organizations spanning state, local, and federal government. Thus, there will be the need to permit collaboration across organizational-boundaries while providing control and accountability and connection back to the central systems of each participating organization. Technology will be required to support the entire life cycle of such teams. Key challenges include knowledge management/corporate memory, declarative policy generation and context-based enforcement, business rules and self-governance, and planning and monitoring team processes. The goals for automation technology include speeding the front-end processes of gathering, filtering, and organizing information and assimilating its content without having to read all of it. On the back-end of the process, technology is needed to automate or semi-automate the generation of efficient and persuasive explanations, and to maintain consistency within a large, distributed multi-media knowledge base. Technology is also required to make the tools and the collaborative environment itself more efficiently used by humans by making it aware of user context and preferences and smart and adaptive to optimize the user experience. DARPA seeks technology to aid the human intellect as teams collaborate to build models of existing threats, generate a rich set of threat scenarios, perform formal risk analysis, and develop options to counter them. These tools should provide structure to the collaborative cognitive work, and externalize it so that it can be examined, critiqued, used to generate narrative and multi-media explanations, and archived for re-use. PROTOTYPE SYSTEM ISSUES:  One of the main objectives of the Information Awareness effort by DARPA is to create a prototype, closed-loop, end-to-end system. It is anticipated that technology and components from existing programs such as Genoa, EELD, WAE, TIDES, HID, Bio-Surveillance; as well as programs resulting from the first two technical areas of this BAA and other programs will be integrated to provide this system. It is envisioned that this system will be developed in an operational environment, but in a research and development mode. Technology concepts, system architecture concepts, management, experimentation and transition concepts to implement this prototype system and assure its transition to operational use are solicited. A modular architecture that permits easy insertion and extraction of functional components is anticipated. This will allow early achievement of end-to-end functional capabilities from collection to decision with available components and increasing capabilities as new components become available for testing and experimentation. This is not the role of the traditional system integrator in that innovative management and integration techniques must be found to take the innovative results from independent R&D programs and put them together into an evolving, more capable prototype system to accomplish the objective of countering terrorism. The U.S. is facing a new evolving complex threat that requires an agile and urgent approach to system integration. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION: The Government anticipates multiple awards in each of three technical areas. A multi-phase approach will be needed to achieve program goals. Proposers should note that approaches with eclectic ideas from multiple technical specialties or communities are actively sought. The degree of advances will vary among the three technical areas of interest, but the goal is to create a series of prototype systems that add value quickly and improves rapidly over the program schedule -- the primary goal is a series of leave-behind prototypes with limited set of proof-of-concept demonstrations in very high risk areas. CAPABILITIES: Significant portions of the effort to be performed under this BAA do not lend themselves to organizations specializing in a particular niche. Given the breadth and depth of capabilities required to accomplish BAA objectives, it is anticipated that successful proposers will possess unparalleled multidisciplinary qualifications in order to maximize the outcomes of leading research and development efforts. In many cases this will require a collaborative approach; therefore, proposals reflecting the effective teaming of parties possessing superior specialized knowledge and expertise are highly encouraged. On a practical level teaming is intended to support critical mass efforts, to enhance the integration of successful algorithms, and to lessen the average burden per researcher associated with conducting evaluations or incorporating (if a team wishes) superior ideas developed by others. DURATION: Research under this BAA is expected to last for five years. During the first 36 months a range of ideas will be developed via limited demonstrations and preliminary prototypes. During the final 24 months the most promising research avenues will be extended to support production of a scalable leave-behind system prototype. PROGRAM SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: All proposers must be U. S. organizations (i.e., for-profit or not-for-profit organization, or academic institution), and most performing personnel must be U.S. citizens. DARPA anticipates selecting proposers for award who would perform unclassified work only. DARPA also intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies. Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement (see "Personal Security Clearance (PCL) Certification," in the PIP); shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance (see "Facility Clearance (FCL) Certification," in the PIP); and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know, as specified in the PIP. GENERAL INFORMATION:  DARPA Information Awareness Office (IAO) is issuing this single step (full-up proposals, no white papers) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for Information Awareness. This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA 02-08) in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102(d)(2)(i). In addition to this BAA, and before submitting a proposal, prospective proposers MUST also obtain and refer to the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for BAA 02-08 ? it provides further information on the areas of interest, program background, anticipated research processes, expected deliverables, preparation and formats for proposals, and proposal evaluation criteria. The BAA as published in the Government wide point of entry, in conjunction with the PIP and all references, comprises the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. This PIP may be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or by downloading from the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government?s needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU or MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: BAA 02-08 will be open for a period of one year after its publication at FedBizOpps. To be considered for the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA/IAO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn: BAA 02-08) on or before 4:00 p.m. local time, 22 April 2002. In addition to hard copies, an electronic copy of each proposal must be submitted on floppy diskette(s) or compact disk(s), according to instructions in the PIP. Proposals submitted by fax or e-mail are NOT acceptable and will NOT be considered. DARPA will neither acknowledge receipt of nor return submissions.  PROPOSAL FORMAT: Detailed instructions for completing the proposals are contained in the PIP. Proposals not conforming to the specified format will not be reviewed or evaluated. EVALUATION, AWARD AND FUNDING: Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:  1) Technical approach, including design innovation and effectiveness, approach for research, implementation and testing; 2) Overall scientific and technical merit; 3) Potential contribution and relevance to this DARPA mission; 4) Proposer's demonstrated capabilities and related experience; and 4) Cost realism and reasonableness. The Government anticipates completing an initial round of evaluations during the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. Resulting awards (if any) may take the form of procurement contracts, cooperative agreements, grants, or agreements entered into under the authority of 10 USC 2371, or Section 845, Public Law 103-160, as amended (commonly referred to as ?technology investment agreements? or ?other transaction agreements for prototypes?). DARPA will construct a balanced program in order to meet its needs. A total of several millions of dollars will be available for these efforts. The size of each award and duration of efforts will vary according to the type of effort undertaken. In the case of proposals containing partitioned segments or phases, proposers should define partitions so that the annual budget for each is in the $200,000 to $1,000,000 range. If warranted, portions or partitions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. The Government also reserves the right to fund all, or any part of, a proposal evaluated to be eligible for award. Awards are subject to the availability of Government funds, and may be incrementally funded. ADDRESSES:  The administrative addresses for this BAA are: Electronic Mail: BAA02-08@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Range Instrumentation System Program Office (RISPO), AAC/WMRR, Eglin AFB, FL is contemplating a single award of a predominately Firm Fixed Price 5 to 7 year contract for the Air Force P4 Replacement Contract Plus (P4RC+).  The Air Force P4RC+ program is a cooperative effort with the Navy that includes Navy requirements and increases the air combat training capability of both services.  Award of any resulting contract is anticipated by 1st quarter of FY03.  The RISPO will conduct a briefing for Industry at the Focus Center (formerly known as the Quality Center) in Niceville FL (turn in to Jackson Guard from Highway 85 just north of the Comfort Inn) on 15 April 2002 at 0900 in building 1532 (phone 850-882-6222).  Additional information regarding Industry Day is provided below within this announcement.  The P4RC+ program is for the initial acquisition of a rangeless non-developmental item (NDI) system with provisions for spiral growth and improvement in subsequent years.  The initial delivery of this acquisition will provide rangeless Air Combat Training System (ACTS)/Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods that have all the capability of pods being acquired under the P4RC contract (F08635-01-D-0056), a secure pod-to-pod data link, real time kill notification (RTKN), and live monitor downlink capability.  The current P4RC pods use a P/Y Code Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver for on-board data recording of time space position information (TSPI) for post mission playback and ground debriefing.  The P4RC+ pods will require Wide Area GPS Enhancement (WAGE) and Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) as well.  The P4RC+ pod-to-pod line of sight range requirement is 80 nautical miles (nmi) with a 90% error free receipt of messages at that range.   Data link frequency authorization has been requested for the following frequency bands: 1350-1530 MHz, 1750-1850 MHz and 2200-2500 MHz, with the 1750?1850 MHz as the primary request, but it is not yet known which frequency bands, nor which parts of these bands will be approved.  Until approved encryption instrumentation is available, P4RC+ pods will record all data needed for post mission debriefing and use a secure data filter and verification to prevent transmission of sensitive information.  The P4RC+ system must be interoperable with the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS) Range Security Initiative (RSI) ground debriefing system.  The P4RC+ pods shall be capable of supporting missions with a minimum of 72 high activity aircraft (HAA).  The P4RC+ pods will require standardized WMSP 98-01, IEEE 1394, and RS-422 interface capability and be compatible with the P4RC debriefing system.  A standardized (non-proprietary) datalink format and Data Recording Device (DRD) recording format will be used for current and future growth capability to include encryption and an advanced data link.  Initially, ground-debriefing subsystems will be provided as GFP from the existing P4RC contract.  These subsystems include the PC-based Squadron Deployable Ground System (SDGS) and the laptop-based Flight Deployable Ground System (FDGS).  Integration of the airborne and GFP-provided ground debriefing subsystems of the P4RC+ system will be the responsibility of the P4RC+ contractor.  Navy airborne instrumentation subsystems (AIS) must be carrier qualified and capable of withstanding the severe carrier electromagnetic environment.  P4RC+ growth provisions:  (1)  The contractor will be required to supply a ground system with live monitor and data uplink control capability.  Air-to-ground and ground-to-air datalink of 125 nmi is required.  Two-way UHF voice communications interface is required.  Fixed range capabilities (primary Navy requirement) include interface with other external systems providing display of up to 100 low activity aircraft (LAA).  The Navy also envisions a growth provision for the live monitor station to exchange track data with the Tactical Air Combat Training System (TACTS) central computer subsystem (CCS).  (2)  Future requirements may require the contractor to modify and integrate government-furnished software to satisfy ground debriefing requirements.  (3)  A primary Navy requirement is to rehost the NDI system as an airborne instrumentation subsystem internal (AISI) on the F/A-18C/D and AV-8B.  An additional growth configuration will be a rack mounted AIS for installation in rotary wing and transport aircraft.       Logistics:  Provisions for training of the existing O&M contractor at the deployment locations for Air Force systems will be part of this solicitation.  Interim contractor support (ICS) will be provided for all operations and maintenance support for the Navy as well as depot support for both the Air Force and Navy for a period not to exceed 2-3 years.  A determination will be made at the end of the ICS period to continue contractor support or to provide organic support.  Delivery:  Delivery of pods to the first location is anticipated within 12 months after receipt of order.  USAF deployment locations are anticipated to follow a similar order and quantities as for the current P4RC program.  The current P4RC contract provides for an estimated 257 pods for nine different locations (Eglin AFB FL, Langley AFB VA, Seymour Johnson AFB SC, Mt Home AFB ID, Homestead ARB FL, Gulfport ANG CRTC MS, Cannon AFB NM, Shaw AFB SC, and Hill AFB UT).  If available funding allows for additional pods, these pods would be delivered to as yet TBD locations.  US Navy quantities are contingent on future funding.  A U.S. SECRET facility clearance will be required prior to award of any resulting contract.  The system must have the capability to display and process up to and including TOP SECRET level.  Potential offerors are required to provide, no later than 08 April 2002, a written statement of capabilities (SOC) package to the RISPO.  The SOC shall include, but not be limited to, successful experience or capability as a prime contractor in:   (1) production or major modification of an existing NDI Air Combat Training System (ACTS) to include AIS or AISI, ground debriefing subsystems, including fixed range capability, and support equipment (hardware and software) that meets the performance requirements specified above to include but not limited to systems with P/Y code GPS receiver, WAGE, SAASM, pod to pod, air-to ground, and ground-to-air  data link range, frequency, and connectivity, and HAA and LAA.  Address which system(s) or parts of systems meet these requirements and where these systems are currently being used.  Identify any requirements that cannot be met with your existing NDI system; (2) O&M and depot level maintenance and logistics experience on a complete ACTS or similar type of system; and (3) facilities and personnel to handle and store classified information at the SECRET/NOFORN level.  All replies to this synopsis must reference RFP Number F08635-03-R-0001.  Submit only unclassified information.  In addition to the requested information, all responses to this synopsis shall include company size status under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

<DESC>DESC: The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention, (DCP) Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (CADRG) is interested in evaluating inhibitors or potential inhibitors of any stage of carcinogenesis, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents.  Such agents are to be further evaluated in appropriate toxicological and/or clinical settings. The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents.  This plan delineates detailed criteria for classifying the quantity and quality of information that currently exists on any chemopreventive agent and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent's experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer.  The primary purpose of this RFP is to further evaluate chemopreventive agents for which there exists at least one published report regarding their effectiveness in inhibiting carcinogenesis.  The object of these studies is to establish the general efficacy of the chemopreventive agent in animal model systems representing selected target organs, different species, and different carcinogens. This RFP involves multiple Workstatements (Nos. 92-97).  Certain study design characteristics apply to the specific Workstatements under this RFP. Most of the requirements for the Workstatement study design will be detailed in the specific workstatement. Each workstatement will have a specific period of performance. The workstatements are:  WS #92: Efficacy Testing in the Strain A Mouse Lung Tumor Model with Selected Chemopreventive Agents and Combinations Administered by Liquid Aerosols; WS #93: Efficacy Testing in the Strain A Mouse Lung Tumor Model with Oltipraz and Other Selected Dithiolthiones  Administered by Aerosolized Particulates; WS #94: Chemopreventive Agent Efficacy Using Chemically Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis in Rats; WS #96: Efficacy of Chemopreventive Agents In The N-Butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-Nitrosamine [OH BBN] Model Of Bladder Carcinogenesis; WS #94: Efficacy Of Potential Chemopreventives Agents Alone or In Combination In The Azoxymethane (AOM)- Induced Colon Cancer Model In Fisher Rats;

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>JOINT PRECISION APPROACH AND LANDING SYSTEM (JPALS) COMPONENT ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT - This is a combined Request for Information (RFI) and Industry Day Announcement for the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Component Advanced Development (CAD) Phase. The following information is provided for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. JPALS Request For Information (RFI). The Electronic Systems Center Navigation and Landing Systems Program Office (ESC/GAL) Program Office at Hanscom AFB, MA is requesting information and feedback from industry on the planned acquisition approach that it plans to use for the CAD Phase of the JPALS Program. ESC/GAL would like to discuss the JPALS CAD acquisition approach and the answers to the accompanying questions, during the JPALS Industry Day. These questions are intended for the prospective prime contractors (and their team members) for the planned Competitive CAD procurement. JPALS Program Background. ESC/GAL and the Satellite Navigation and ATCALS Program Office at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD are responsible for the research and development of the JPALS, the next generation landing system for the Department of Defense (DoD). JPALS is intended to support all precision approach and landing operations: fixed base, tactical, shipboard, and special mission, under a wide range of meteorological conditions. ESC/GAL is responsible for developing the fixed base, tactical, and special mission versions of JPALS while NAWCAD is responsible for the shipboard version of JPALS. ESC/GAL has nearly completed its initial Architecture and Requirements Definition (ARD) efforts including the development and testing of a prototype LDGPS precision approach and landing system (known as the LDGPS Demonstration System) in a jamming environment and the completion of initial architecture and guidance quality studies and analysis. The Raytheon Company performed these efforts under the initial JPALS LDGPS Contract (No. F19628-99-C-0039). The major JPALS CAD efforts are outlined below. Upon completion of these CAD efforts a Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) will be convened to approve a Milestone B decision for the JPALS Program and initiate the start of the JPALS System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase. The SDD procurement is expected to be a full and open competition. CAD Acquisition Approach. The currently planned acquisition approach for JPALS CAD includes both a competitive and sole source procurement. These procurements are planned to be conducted in parallel to achieve the overall objectives of the JPALS CAD Phase. A brief description of these procurements is provided below. Competitive CAD Procurement. The planned competitive procurement will result in the award of up to two (2) prime contracts to accomplish the tasks and objectives described in the draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for JPALS CAD (Competitive Effort), located on the ESC HERBB site (<<<<http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/>>>>). A sources sought synopsis for the competitive CAD procurement was published on the Federal Business Opportunities web site, <<<<http://www.fedbizopps.gov/>>>>, on February 6, 2002 (ref. F19628-02-R-0021). As part of the RFP for the competitive CAD procurement the Government plans to require a minimum of two (2) anti-jam (AJ) technology alternatives to be included in the offeror's proposal, with an objective of at least one (1) additional AJ technology alternative. The RFP will require the AJ alternatives to be bid as priced options. This approach will result in two contracts, each with a minimum of two (2) AJ alternatives each or a total of four (4) AJ alternatives. We notionally plan to exercise three (3) AJ alternative options. One of the key objectives of the JPALS CAD effort is to evaluate or assess the compatibility of AJ technologies with the ability to meet precision approach guidance quality and availability requirements. The proposed AJ alternatives should be mature enough to be operated and evaluated as part of a flight test (probably in an Air Force C-12J). The flight testing is tentatively scheduled to occur in the third or fourth quarter of FY03. The AJ alternatives will be needed earlier to support integration and lab testing with JPALS Demonstration System. We have assembled a listing of vendors and potential AJ alternatives to support the above objectives of evaluating the compatibility of AJ technologies with precision approach performance. This list is not all-inclusive; there are likely other AJ technologies and vendors that we have forgotten or are unaware of. Furthermore, the Government in no way endorses these vendors or their technologies; we are simply providing this information to facilitate your market research for AJ technology alternatives. The list will be provided on Fed Biz Ops and the ESC HERBB sites. Sole Source CAD Procurement. The planned sole source procurement will result in a single contract award to the Raytheon Company. A Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for the planned sole source contract was published on the Federal Business Opportunities web site, <<<<http://www.fedbizopps.gov/>>>>, on February 6, 2002 (ref. F19628-02-R-0020). The sole source contract tasks include: a. Upgrades and modifications to the JPALS LDGPS Demonstration System hardware and software developed and tested by Raytheon under their JPALS ARD Contract. b. The integration and lab testing of AJ technology alternatives, GPS receivers, software (e.g., differential correction algorithms), and other related equipment with the JPALS Demonstration System. The AJ alternatives, GPS receivers, software and related equipment will be obtained under the competitive CAD contracts. The respective competitive CAD prime contractor or subcontractor providing this equipment or software will be tasked to support the integration and lab testing with the Demonstration System. A description of the Demonstration System will be provided in the Raytheon JPALS Flight Test ION GPS paper on the Fed Biz Ops and the ESC HERBB sites. c. The support of Government flight testing of the Demonstration System (with the AJ alternatives, GPS receivers, software, and related equipment), including system set-up, aircraft integration, operation and data collection. d. Perform additional analysis and testing of the GAS-1 and develop and evaluate modifications to the existing Demonstration System software that might improve system performance. Questions for Prospective Offeror's (prospective Prime Contractors) for the JPALS Competitive CAD Procurement. The Government would like to obtain answers to the following questions prior to our planned JPALS CAD Industry Day Meeting(s). Answers should be provided in writing no later than close of business April 1, 2002. Your written responses should not exceed ten (10) single sided pages. Please be prepared to discuss your answers during Industry Day. Q1. The Government intends to compete the JPALS SDD Phase using information and data developed and obtained under the JPALS competitive CAD contracts. Are you willing to provide your JPALS architecture and performance requirement recommendations and supporting rationale without restrictions on the reuse or dissemination of this data by the Government? Are you willing to provide this information on a non-proprietary basis and with unlimited rights? Q2. What teaming arrangements do you foresee? Have you contacted GPS anti-jam manufacturers or vendors to determine their interest in working with and teaming with you during CAD? Do you think you will be able to identify at least two (but preferably three) AJ vendors willing to team with you? In what other areas are you planning to team other than AJ?

<DESC>DESC: The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention, (DCP) Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (CADRG) is interested in evaluating inhibitors or potential inhibitors of any stage of carcinogenesis, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents.  Such agents are to be further evaluated in appropriate toxicological and/or clinical settings. The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents.  This plan delineates detailed criteria for classifying the quantity and quality of information that currently exists on any chemopreventive agent and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent's experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer.  The primary purpose of this RFP is to further evaluate chemopreventive agents for which there exists at least one published report regarding their effectiveness in inhibiting carcinogenesis.  The object of these studies is to establish the general efficacy of the chemopreventive agent in animal model systems representing selected target organs, different species, and different carcinogens. This RFP involves multiple Workstatements (Nos. 92-97).  Certain study design characteristics apply to the specific Workstatements under this RFP. Most of the requirements for the Workstatement study design will be detailed in the specific workstatement. Each workstatement will have a specific period of performance. The workstatements are:  WS #92: Efficacy Testing in the Strain A Mouse Lung Tumor Model with Selected Chemopreventive Agents and Combinations Administered by Liquid Aerosols; WS #93: Efficacy Testing in the Strain A Mouse Lung Tumor Model with Oltipraz and Other Selected Dithiolthiones  Administered by Aerosolized Particulates; WS #94: Chemopreventive Agent Efficacy Using Chemically Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis in Rats; WS #96: Efficacy of Chemopreventive Agents In The N-Butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-Nitrosamine [OH BBN] Model Of Bladder Carcinogenesis; WS #94: Efficacy Of Potential Chemopreventives Agents Alone or In Combination In The Azoxymethane (AOM)- Induced Colon Cancer Model In Fisher Rats;
WS #97: Chemoprevention Screening Employing A Transgenic Mouse Model Which Yields Prostate Tumors In Male Mice And Breast Tumors In Female Mice.

<DESC>This Modification is to correct the RFP Number which may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page. The solicitation announcement should read as follows:  The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization to provide for the storage and distribution of their repository of chemical and drug samples.  This contract is responsible for the web-based acquisition of new compounds for testing and the receipt, storage, distribution, documentation, and inventory of synthetic compounds, bulk chemical drugs and crystalline natural products which have been identified as potential anticancer and anti-AIDS agents.  This effort also includes the plating of approximately 140,000 compounds in the DTP open repository.  The contractor shall take responsibility for all tasks of the repository.  The responsibilities shall include the receipt, weighing, distribution and storage of new and previously acquired chemical samples.  All new potential chemotherapeutic agents evaluated by the Program, whether single compounds or plated materials, are received and registered in the Program by this contract.  The contractor is also responsible for the management of correspondence to and from the compounds suppliers; for creation, using the web-based acquisition procedures, and maintenance of the chemical database; systematic file and record keeping; and reacquisition of needed samples for continued in vitro testing and subsequent in vivo studies.  The contractor shall provide for the proper disposal of samples which have been returned from various screening laboratories, and  shall prepare Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for specific compounds as required by the Project Officer.  In addition, the Contractor controls the inventory of approximately 400,000 chemical samples, which are a valuable resource to the Program and the extramural community.  PHARMACEUTICAL, CHEMICAL, OR BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRMS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS COMPETITION SINCE THE COMPOUND SAMPLES AND COMPOUND INFORMATION STORED IN THE DTP COMPUTER SYSTEM IS OF A PROPRIETARY NATURE.  A pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.  It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, term (level of effort) type contract award will be made for a five-year period of performance with incremental funding each year.  To assist in the preparation of a proposal, the Government considers the effort to be 28,500 direct labor hours annually.  The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately 03/27/2002.  The proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  The RFP # N02-CM-27010-28 may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.

<DESC>NA Reference Request for Quote DAHA24-02-T-0015, a combined synopsis/solicitation to purchase 20 metal boxes/storage containers for the Montana Army National Guard.   The following answers and clarifications are provided as a result of questions submitted to the Contracting Officer:  Question 1.  The drawings showing the side view of the containers show all corner angle iron to be welded top of the 14ft. length angle iron.  The isometric external view shows the corner angle to rest directly on to the 2” X 6” rectangular tubing.  Which do you want (prefer the first)? Answer1.   In response to the angle iron resting on the 2” X 6” tubing, that is the way the container was designed.  As far as the angle iron actually resting on the 2” X 6” tubing, the container will be manufactured before the tubing is installed so there  will be 1/8” to ¼” between both subjects.   Question 2.  We also need the sizes of the cross members for support of the lid (square tubing). Answer 2.   The cross members should be 1 ½” Square tube = at 1/8 “ thick.   Question 3.  We need the size of the material used on the split hinge top and the type of locking device you are requesting. Answer 3.   The flange of the hinge will be fabricated out of ¼” thick plate steel.  The hinge pin will be 7/8” shaft and the pin sleeve will be ¼” wall tubing (7/8)” to (1)” inside diameter. The locking device that we would like to see is some type of cam-lock lever system that pull the lids down and together for a tighter seal.  There needs to be a place for some type of external lock to secure the box.  The lock can be repressed or the clear ance of the locking device must be such to not interfere with the stackability clearance of the containers. Question 4.  What color should the containers be? Answer 4.     The containers shall be plain steel with out any type of paint.   Question 5.  There is conflicting information on the type of steel used for the boxes, with is it? Answer 5.    The boxes shall be made from 20-gauge steel.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  The deadline for receipt of quotes remains the same, March 27, 2002.  The can be mailed or faxed in.

SCOPE OF SERVICES FOR CONTRACTOR'S PREFERRED PRICING PROGRAM A.  Purpose of  Preferred Pricing Program (PPP) The purpose of the PPP is to assist the VA in meeting their economic objectives.  The VA will not endorse or refer eligible veterans to individual physicians or PPO networks.  When eligible veterans receive their healthcare from providers in the private sector through the VA Fee Basis, the PPP allows participating VAMCs to share in the savings available through the discounts in managed care networks.   The program allows savings for a variety of health care services through Contractor's provider networks including  hospitalization, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, behavioral health, ancillary and other services. B. Preferred Pricing Program Processes The contractor will perform preferred pricing services.  This includes making health care provider networks available to the VA and providing the preferred price to the VA so the VA can then pay the provider.   1. When eligible veterans use PPP providers for hospitalizations, inpatient services, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, dental, professional services, ancillary, and other services; discounted rates will be available to VAMCs participating in the PPP.' 2. All PPP providers will submit their claims to the individual VAMC.  The VAMC establishes eligibility, that the service is a covered benefit, and determines the VA allowable (the amount the VA will pay on that particular claim).   The participating VAMC will document the VA allowable amount on the claim and forward claims greater than $150 to the contractor.  The contractor will verify the providers participation with the contractor's PPO and annotate their best price for the services claimed, returning the information to the VAMC.  The VAMC will determine the best value to the government and make payment on that basis.  Reporting and invoicing protocols assume the VA will select the lesser of the two prices.   3. The contractor will provide monthly reports detailing the price the VAMC would have paid comparing it to the Contractor preferred price.  These reports must be provided within 10 days of the end of the calendar month in which the service was provided.  Contractor will calculate the amount saved and use that amount for invoicing. C. Preferred Pricing Program requires activities from four different entities.     The VA will exercise oversight of the contractor and will have responsibilities for some portions of the claims flow.   The VA will issue the payments to providers from VA funds.  D. VA Responsibility: 1. VAMCs will appoint a liaison to assist in coordinating with internal VAMC assets.  2. VAMCs must: copy claims; forward and receive copied documents from the PPP contractor; track and reconcile claims; reconcile and certify monthly invoices.  3. The VA will retain responsibility for payment to providers submitting authorized claims. 4. VAMCs will retain the responsibility for making payments to the contractor for certified savings in accordance with Section V.  Participating Medical Centers may provide a No Charge (N/C) purchase order to the contractor to initiate this BOA.   E. Contractor Responsibility: 1. The contractor will serve as the prime contractor with overall responsibility for program management.  The contractor will integrate all subcontractor activities.  The contractor will ensure access to and adequacy of a discounted network to achieve savings from VA Allowable rates.  The contractor's payment administrator will process the claims from receipt up to, but not including, issuance of payment. 2. Provide VAMCs access to managed care provider networks offering discounts. 3. Working with internal and external claims personnel. 4. Re-pricing and returning claims within 6 business days for paper or fax claims and 3 business days for EDI claims.  Invoices not processed within the designated turnaround time will be treated as non-discountable and processed by the VA accordingly.  The contractor fee will be paid only when the network price is used - claims not meeting the turnaround time will not be considered for reimbursement unless the PPP is utilized. 5. Contractor will prepare an individual pricing form for every claim and return it to the VA with the discounted price clearly written on it. 6. Provide opportunity for future EDI transmission of claims. 7. Submit standard reports in a timely manor.  Quarterly reports to VISN 23 shall include a summary of each participating facility's demonstrated cost savings.  Monthly summary reports for each VAMC's Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) will be provided with the invoice for fee reimbursement. ( See Paragraph I B 3 and Section III.) 8. The contractor will pay for overnight or second day shipping when it is used. II.	PROJECT PLAN A Project Plan will be developed that includes the following: 1. Implementation Meeting (Representatives from the contractor, VAMC fee or business office, and the COTR) a. Review process b. Review responsibilities c. Identify key contact personnel d. Develop timeline estimates e. Gather claims volume estimates f. Identify known problem areas 2. Agree upon post-payment adjustment protocol. 3. Discuss interface with Claims staff (internal and external). 4. Schedule meeting with Claims staff for implementation.  The contractor personnel will travel to and from implementation meetings at the contractor' expense. 5. Gather provider contract information. 6. Make recommendations for modifying provider contracts as needed.   7. Perform preferred pricing. 8. Review Medical Center and COTR reports. 9. Conduct savings review with COTR. 10. Monitor preferred pricing process. 11. Establish ability to download claims electronically 12. Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness of preferred pricing. III.	VALIDATING SAVINGS The individual VAMCs will retain the right to review and otherwise audit any part of the preferred pricing process at any time.  The contractor will submit monthly reports to the VAMC showing claims submitted and claims with savings.  This report will list the VA price and the contractor price. The contractor will use this savings report to generate invoices to each VAMC.   IV.	PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY The contractor will comply with all statutory, regulatory, and VA policy requirements related to patient privacy and confidentiality.  Reference FAR 52.224-1 Privacy Act Notification (Apr 1984) and FAR 52.224-2 Privacy Act (Apr 1984) of this agreement. V.	PRICING The contractor will provide preferred pricing services to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  If there is no savings, there is no fee.  The contractor fee is a percentage of savings on a per claim basis.  The VA pays nothing until savings are realized.  There is no additional fee beyond the percentage of savings fee.  The fee for the contractor' preferred pricing services will be incurred only when cost savings are recognized.  The contractor fee shall be a percentage of the savings per claim.  Savings are defined as the difference between the VA allowable (the amount the VA was would pay) and the contractor PPP. Pricing Examples: Example 1 Claim value from provider (billed charges):	$    350.00 VA priced amount:	$    200.00 Contractor Network amount:	$    100.00 Savings:	$    100.00 Contractor Fee (25% of savings):	$      25.00 Example 2 Claim value from provider (billed charges):	$ 1,500.00 VA priced amount:	$    975.00 Contractor Network amount:	$    325.00 Savings:	$    650.00 Contractor Fee (20% of savings):	$    130.00 Example 3 Claim value from provider (billed charges):	$ 15,000.00 VA priced amount:	$   8,000.00 Contractor Network amount:	$      999.00 Savings:	$   7,001.00 Contractor Fee (15% of savings):	$   1,050.15 VI.  PAYMENT Payment will be made to the contractor in arrears, based on the agreed upon rates as applied to the reconciled and certified monthly invoices, by modification to the initial purchase order VII.  IMPLEMENTATION The contractor shall have 90 days for a  start-up period after receipt of the individual Delivery Order from the specific, participating VAMC. VIII.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala, Uganda has compiled a series of sector studies and analyses relating to export growth and increased competitiveness in regional and world markets. These studies, undertaken by consultants funded by USAID, the EU, DFID and UNDP, have been provided to the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance. The sector studies were also summarized for presentation to the President of Uganda and senior officials of the Government of Uganda. While the studies include a number of recommendations for the Government of Uganda to consider, these recommendations have not necessarily been adopted. They will be the subject of ongoing discussions with government, the private sector and donors over the coming months. The information in these reports may be useful to offerors in preparing proposals in response to RFP 617-02-003. Files containing these studies and analyses may be obtained from USAID/Uganda by sending an e-mail request to Diana Atungire at datungire@usaid.gov. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the FBO Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy. You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the FBO Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing, in general, and particularly from overseas Missions. You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the FBO Internet. As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from FBO INTERNET in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments. NAICS: 541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated Not To Exceed (NTE) $20 million. See Solicitation, posted February 28, 2002.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-30
<RESPDATE>040502
<ARCHDATE>04202002
<CONTACT>Major Kevin Vlcek, Program Manager, Phone (505) 846-9259, Fax null, Email Kevin.Vlcek@kirtland.af.mil - Kenneth West, Contracting Officer, Phone (505) 846-7381, Fax null, Email kenneth.west@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR   15.201(e). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This request does not commit the government to contract for any product or service whatsoever.

BACKGROUND:  The Rocket System Launch Program (SMC Det 12/RP) is interested in the following three technologies:  1) aerospace grade rayon, 2) aerospace grade flight (nickel cadmium, silver zinc and lithium ion) batteries, and 3) Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) electronics and guidance, navigation and control (G&C) systems such as single axis rate sensors using micro machined silicon (MEMS) technology.  These items have potential for our mission of reusing excess ICBM motors for orbital and suborbital launches.  RSLP is currently searching for potential suppliers of these technologies for future system applications of our launch program.  OBJECTIVE:  US suppliers and manufacturers of these specific technologies may submit a white paper detailing their product and its capabilities.  Include cost of production assets and define any development costs required to make the components flight qualified. Cost estimates are for planning purposes and will not be binding to the vendor.

Submission of white paper will be accepted as an indication of interest in future dialogue but not binding to contractor or Government.  WHITE PAPER INSTRUCTIONS: Interested parties should submit a white paper, limited to five (5) pages per technology, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches. Marketing/product brochures may be submitted in addition to the white paper, and are not included in the 5 page limit. White papers shall be submitted in an original plus two copies, and are due no later than 5 April 2002, 4:00 p.m. MST. 


The Government reserves the right to review any late submissions. Submit white papers to the technical point of contact, Major Kevin Vlcek, Detachment 12, Space & Missile Systems Center, 3548 Aberdeen Ave. S.E., Building 415, Room 208, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico 87117-5778.

<SUBJECT>99--BAA - Development of Wire Testing and Inspection Systems
<SOLNBR>2358
<RESPDATE>053102
<CONTACT>Robert Pappas, 609-485-6181
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-02-0001 Development of Wire Testing and Inspection Systems 1. Background The continued safe operation of aircraft well into their expected service life depends on the safe and effective transfer of power and electrical signals between aircraft electrical components.  This in turn requires the verification of wire physical and functional integrity.  In the event that wire is treated as indefinite life items, formal periodic inspections will be necessary to ensure its continued safe operation.  Whether wire is eventually subject to a fixed service life, condition based monitoring, or other life management program, there will still be a need for periodic inspection to: 1) ensure the absence of accidental damage; 2) verify service life estimates; and, 3) confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving wire. 2. Purpose The purpose of this BAA is to support development of testing and inspection systems! , technology, and techniques that identify or characterize the material or structural flaws which may impair the safe and effective electrical transmission of power and signals.  The proposed systems, technology, and techniques shall exhibit potential utility for either infrequent comprehensive examinations or frequent focused inspections in an airline maintenance environment. 3. Submission Deadlines Offers will be accepted and evaluated as long as FY 2002 funding for this effort remains uncommitted, but not after June 01, 2002. 4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal.  The two page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the two page technical summaries to: 			Mr. Robert A. Pappas Code AAR-433 William J. Hughes Technical Center Atlantic City Int’l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be ! emailed to rob.pappas@tc.faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format. Thirty days after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	With a request for the submission a formal technical proposal; b.	With a recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met; or, c.	With a letter requesting no further input on the proposed system, technology, or technique. If the offeror then elects to submit a formal technical proposal, it shall contain a more detailed discussion of the item presented in the two-page technical summary and meet the specific project requirements as described in the ‘Formal Proposal Requirements’ section of this announcement.  The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal.  An electronic copy must also be provided. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements!  There is no specific format for the two page technical summary.  The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation.  Though there is no specific format, at a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	The specific purpose of the system, technology, or technique; b.	A description of the system, technology, or technique; c.	A description of the class of applications for which the device is useful; d.	A description of how the device might be useful to the aviation community; e.	Information regarding interest or endorsements of aviation concerns; f.	The current state of development of the system, technology, or technique; g.	The estimated time it would take to develop a commercial prototype; and, h.	The estimated funds required for the proposed effort. 6. Formal Proposal Requirements  a.	Offerors shall specify the development of a device with performance and cost specifications matching the requirements o! f some application or class of applications of interest to some segment of the aviation community.  The device may measure:  1.	Physical properties of the wire insulation (elastic modulus, hardness, etc.);  2.	Material and structural anomalies (cuts, abrasions, chemical properties, etc.);  3.	Local electrical properties of the wire and/or insulation (dielectric constants, resistance, etc.);  4.	Bulk electrical properties of the wire (resistance, impedance, capacitance, isolation, AC&DC voltage drop, polarization ratio, dissipation factor, etc.); or, 5.	Other relevant wire and insulation properties (thermal excursions under load, electromagnetic fields, etc.). b.	Offerors should identify a partner within the aviation community (i.e. an airframer or aircraft operator) who will serve as an advisor and advocate for the effort.  Matching funds or services-in-kind from the partner are not required but will be considered positively during proposal evaluation. c.	Offerors will selec! t Polyimide, and one or more wire types from the list below that are inspectable by the proposed device.  These selections will be used to independently validate the performance of the device.  1.	PVC/Glass/Nylon (MIL-W-5086, QUAD 4, etc.)  2.	Cross Linked ETFE (MIL-W-22759, Tefzel, Spec 55, etc) 3.	Poly-X (alkane-imide)  4.	Composite construction involving Polyimide or Teflon (TKT, etc)  d.	Using empirical evidence and sound logic, offerors will present a persuasive argument that the properties, states, and/or conditions (aging and non-aging conditions) measured by the device correlate with failure modes, which can threaten the safety of the aircraft. e.	Offerors shall propose to build a prototype device with the specifications identified above.  f.	Offerors shall propose to the FAA a validation plan, which includes double blind testing. g.	Offerors shall prepare a technology transfer plan, describing how the proposed technology will be developed into commercial products pr! actical for use in the inspection and maintenance of older aircraft.  h.	Offerors shall include a detailed cost proposal. 7. Method of Evaluation  Proposals will be evaluated in seven technical areas listed.  In order of decreasing importance, the areas are: a.	Technical merit; b.	Utility to the aviation community; c.	Investigator competency and experience; d.	Management plan; e.	Implementation risks; f.	Availability of equipment and facilities; and, g.	Technical risk. Cost and cost realism will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable only.  Acceptable proposals will have costs commensurate with the work load proposed and will not be in excess of  $500,000 in any fiscal year.   8. Period of Performance:  Efforts lasting between one and three years will be considered.  Multiyear efforts will be funded in yearly increments, providing measurable and adequate performance is shown prior to each new funding increment. <P>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is seeking expressions of interest 
to understand the Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) industry and identify potential solutions to address the challenges of developing a mission reconfigurable UUV.  NAVSEA seeks to design and build a 21" diameter Mission Reconfigurable Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (MRUUV).  The MRUUV is intended as a submarine (SSN688 and Virginia Class) operated system capable of meeting the Navy's requirements for clandestine Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and limited Ocean Survey.  The system will be housed in the submarine's torpedo room with launch and recovery through the submarine's torpedo tubes.  The MRUUV will consist of two sections, a basic vehicle and a mission payload.  This sources sought is for the basic vehicle only.  The basic vehicle is defined as the propulsion, energy, navigation, communications, electronics, guidance and control, obstacle avoidance, and launch and recovery subsystems, as well as the support equipment that allows the MRUUV to conduct basic vehicle functions.  Development and procurement of mission payloads will be though separate agencies and efforts.  Payloads are mission specific hardware, which when integrated into the basic vehicle allows the MRUUV to conduct the desired missions. 
The initial operational capability (IOC) for the 21" diameter MRUUV is scheduled for fiscal year 2007.  Achieving this IOC will require quick resolution of several basic vehicle performance risks.  Areas requiring immediate risk reduction include vehicle recovery, autonomy, energy, and reliability.  Fluid flow and vehicle dynamics around an operating submarine are not well defined, and therefore present a risk for both system design and certification.  After launch, the vehicle must operate entirely autonomous of the host submarine.  Autonomous functions include transit to operating area, obstacle avoidance, collection of data, transmission of data, responding to directed changes, return to a designated rendezvous location and recovery.  The MRUUV will require a high energy density system to meet endurance, and transit requirements.  High energy dense systems require safety certification prior to deployment aboard a submarine.  Submarine certification is a time consuming, costly process.  Previous UUV studies determined that achieving the required reliability for long endurance missions requires early and concerted engineering efforts during the vehicle design.

Interested companies should provide a ten (10) page (maximum) presentation explaining how they plan to modify or repackage existing systems to develop the basic MRUUV vehicle.  Presentations should describe how the company would address the above basic vehicle requirements and risks, identify any required Government furnished equipment or information (GFE/I), the proposed system integration effort to repackage existing subsystems and any GFE/I, a schedule to meet the required 2007 IOC and a rough order of magnitude cost estimate.  The ROM estimate should be based on the cost to design, fabricate, test, and field one vehicle, the necessary shipboard equipment and any depot support equipment required.

Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide Web(Internet) presence (if any), size of firm, number of years performing related work and direct points of contact including e-mail addresses. Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail or facsimile will be accepted.  The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.  All data will be for official Government use only. A list of interested parties will be compiled from the firms who respond to this announcement. Firms that wish to be included on the interested parties list must be able to, as a minimum, 1) access the World Wide Web; 2) send and receive unclassified e-mail; and 3) access, download and print pre-solicitation documents from Internet websites. Responses to this announcement should be received in this office NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM (EST) on 08 April 2002. Please direct all responses to attention of LTJG John J.

It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information will be considered. This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or a Request for Proposals (RFP).*****

<DESC>NA The Product Manager, Aircrew Integrated Systems (PM ACIS) is currently investigating potential commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software to satisfy the requirements for an Electronic Data Manager (EDM).  The objective of the final EDM product i s to perform the following functions; however, if initial prototypes do not meet all these capabilities, then a path toward these desired goals should be shown. (1) The device will contain an electronic flight computer that interfaces with Aviation Mission Planning System (AMPS) and allows limited offsite/enroute mission planning, contains a digital moving map display, and allows enroute threat weapon and threat r adar range and deadspace analysis; (2) EDM will be compatible with current and planned Government off-the-shelf mission planning software such as Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and FALCONVIEW; (3) It will provide the capability to perform weight and balance, performance planning, and other computations currently performed using the CPU-26A/C (or E6B) aviation computer; (4) The EDM will have a two-hour internal, rechargeable, battery backup system; (5) It will also provide the individual aviator with a n automation capability to maintain and inscribe in-flight information and notes similar to the function currently accomplished using the aviator's kneeboard; (6) The device will allow the aviator to rapidly enter and retrieve information prior to and duri ng flight without the need for traditional pen and paper; (7) The EDM must provide its user the ability to selectively and rapidly clear classified/sensitive media, in accordance with AR 380-19, to reduce the possibility of transfer of data to the enemy; ( 8) The EDM will have the ability to electronically display aircraft digitized checklists when made available in digital form; (9) All information will be visible to the aviator during flight under all lighting conditions and will be night vision system com patible; (10) The system should be capable of being mounted to the aviator's left or right leg and be easily operated by either hand; (11) The device's primary power source will be internal aircraft power; (12) Environmental operating conditions of the EDM  will be consistent with cockpit temperatures, but must also allow for transportation and storage of the EDM at temperatures down to -60 degrees F; (13) The device will contain instrument and GPS approach plates.  -----The Army's acquisition strategy is to  conduct EDM user evaluations in early May 2002 until 28 June 2002.  The Army is presently conducting an Internet market survey identifying COTS hardware and software that might satisfy the above requirements.  The hardware/software vendors will be contact ed for participation.  The Army plans to document its demonstration/testing findings in a report that will be provided to each vendor that participates in the program.  The minimum acceptable EDM requirements will be provided in a Request For Quote in earl y August 2002.  The Government will purchase a small number of units for additional field testing with delivery occurring in early September 2002.  Additional units may be purchased as funding allows.   Any vendors wishing to participate in this demonstration phase please e-mail a description of your hardware/software to Mr. Wieter (kent.wieter@peoavn.redstone.army.mil).  Responses should also include the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a po int of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representatives.

<SUBJECT>A--POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FOR NUCLEAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Glenn Research Center intends to conduct research projects over the next several years focused on Power System Development for Nuclear Electric Propulsion.  The goal is to conduct conceptual design studies and to address key technology needs.  Both deep space and near-Earth environments should be considered.  The In-Space Propulsion Technologies Program fosters the development of innovative space propulsion concepts and the assessment of those concepts in ground, flight, or engineering model demonstrations. NASA GRC plans to conduct analytical studies, lab demonstrations, field demonstrations, requirements analysis, design, and engineering model construction for innovative techniques that have the highest potential to meet the goals for the Advanced Space Transportation Program and the requirements of the Office of Space Science. NASA GRC is seeking partners from the aerospace industry to participate with NASA GRC Principal Investigators (PI) to develop proposals in response to NRA-02-OSS-01-ISTP.  It is expected that selection of the proposal(s) and availability of funds would result in design study and technology development contracts for the selected partner(s).  This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.  It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) proposal inputs, including: conceptual designs, technical data, project schedules and cost estimates, consistent with the requirements of NASA OSS solicitations.  The NRA is soliciting a multi-phased program consisting of a design study followed by a technology development and testing activity.  In support of the design study phase, potential partners will be expected to limit their scope to a $75,000 - $100,000 level of effort.  Subsequent technology development and hardware testing phases will result in additional scope and correspondingly higher priced efforts. Potential partners are requested to submit a statement of interest and capability. This statement should demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide conceptual design and technology development information for systems, subsystems, and components. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA GRC and other potential aerospace industry partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by GRC based on the following criteria:         1) Relevant experience, technical capability and availability of key personnel         This criterion evaluates the proposer's relevant recent experience, technical capability to perform the tasks and key personnel available to support the tasks.  Substantive evidence of successful participation in related efforts should be included.         2) Management Processes        This criterion evaluates the proposer's ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide descriptions of program/project control and management processes used in similar technology development programs. Responses should be limited to 3 pages (12 point, Times Roman font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH 44135 Attn: Ernest C. Mensurati, M.S. 500-319 or via e-mail to Ernest.C.Mensurati@grc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB April 30, 2002. Procurement questions should be directed to Ernest C Mensurati at (216) 433-2727.        Partners are sought for the following technology areas. The technical requirements and NASA GRC point of contact for technical questions is Lee Mason ((216) 977-7106 or Lee.Mason@grc.nasa.gov). 1.	Brayton Power Conversion System (50-500 kWe) including Brayton engines, thermal management (radiators), controls, and Power Management and Distribution (PMAD).

<SUBJECT>70 -- SSA Intends to Negotiate Solely with Kestrel Associates, Inc.
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Telecommunication and Systems Operations (OTSO) intends to negotiate solely with Kestrel Associates, Inc., Versar Center, Suite 200, Springfield, VA 22151 to acquire maintenance service for Hardware already supported by Kestrel Associates, Inc. Maintenance service is for Gateway Servers installed on the Main Library System.  Maintenance would include Hardware support and assistance to any upgrades to be released.   The Hardware is currently in use on the Agency?s Main Library System, located at 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD.  Additional components are to be added to an existing computer system supporting the Agency?s Main Library System and is considered to be an additional requirement.   The Agency is recommending that Kestrel Associates, Inc. because of their established maintenance experience with the existing system fulfill this procurement action and associated system upgrades performed during the course of an existing contract.  Contracting the maintenance service to another vendor may cause delays or disruption in maintenance service due to a learning curve or the use of unfamiliar components or modifications.  As Kestrel Associates is maintaining the majority of this equipment, selecting another vendor for this support may complicate the route of responsibility, such as contacting the correct technical assistant for maintenance assistance.   Therefore, Kestrel Associates is the only viable vendor that can supply the necessary required maintenance support.   This is not a request for quotation or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Request for copies of a solicitation and/or telephone calls will not be honored or acknowledged.  The government will not pay for information received.  If after March 29, 2002, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, SSA shall initiate negotiations solely with Kestrel Associates, Inc.  You may either mail your information to the attention of Cynthia Spencer, Contract Specialist at the address provided herein or email to Cynthia.Spencer @ssa.gov.  The size limitation for email attachments is five megabytes per individual email message.  The SSA utilizes Microsoft WORD 97 as the standard word processing software.  Respondents should refer to Reference Number: SSA-02-KESTREL.

<SUBJECT>R -- Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 617-02-006, USAID/Uganda Strengthening Support Systems Program
<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala, Uganda has issued a Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement aspects of Strategic Objective 8, Human Capacity Improved. This is one of three strategic objectives which compose the USAID/Uganda Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) for the years 2002-2007. The ISP and annexes may be downloaded in three files from http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT976.pdf , http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT977.pdf , and http://ww.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT978.pdf . A thorough understanding of the USAID/Uganda ISP and the Government of Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (http://www.finance.go.ug/documents.html) should prove very useful to offerors in preparing responsive proposals, once the RFP is issued. The solicitation, when issued, will seek proposals to implement USAID/Ugandas Strengthening Support Systems activity, which will focus on increasing the capacity of national level support systems to sustain social sector service delivery in an improved enabling environment.  The activity will help to sustain and reinforce the necessary conditions for improved health, longer and more productive life, greater access to employment opportunities, and increased productivity by addressing the key problems of: high fertility, morbidity and mortality, rapid population growth, illiteracy, poor educational performance, and declining educational quality.  The activity will be implemented through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years.  The Draft RFP will be posted through March 15, 2002.  The actual solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about April 1, 2002.  To request a copy of the Draft RFP that was posted on March 6, 2002, please send an E-mail request to: rrutter@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417. We also request that you include a current telephone number and/or a fax number or an e-mail address where you can be contacted. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy). You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet. As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from INTERNET in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation at FBO. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendment.
