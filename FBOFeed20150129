<DESC>THIS IS A REVISED SYNOPSIS DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE NAICS CODE. THIS SYNOPSIS IS ISSUED UNDER NAICS CODE 541712, (RESERCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING SERVICES, AND LIFE SCIENCES), TO APPROPRIATELY CLAFFISY THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK.
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO NOTIFY INDUSTRY OF THE USAF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICIATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.</p>
<p>The 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Group (EWG), Edwards, AFB intends to solicit and award a sole source contract, 5-year IDIQ to Avarint, LLC, 4455 Genesee Street, Buffalo, NY 14225. <br /><br />The resultant contract, called VIEWS II, is planned to support various efforts for the Air Force Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) Upgrades program at the AFTC, 412 Test Wing, 412 Electronic Warfare Group (EWG), and continue the integration efforts executing under the Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) program. The contract will provide for various engineering services, including support for continued development and enhancement activities supporting the DIADS and AWTEC programs. The DIADS and AWTEC programs, together, provide an integrated EW test capability. The objective of the contract services in VIEWS II tasks are to provide increased threat simulator fidelity and threat signal density, as well as to improve efficiencies with regard to real-time test execution; environment monitoring techniques; and data capture, processing, and initial analysis.</p>
<p>Extensive market research efforts have been conducted for this effort. A Sources Sought Synopsis was advertised categorically as DIADS and AWTEC scopes of work. The notice for the proposed acquisition advised industry of the pending acquisition as well as solicited inquiries from interested parties. Eleven candidate companies responded and were evaluated, which included the incumbent, Avarint. The evaluation included teleconferences, questionnaires, and written correspondence that resulted in a qualifying scoring matrix. From this market research, it was assessed that only one contractor, Avarint, was fully qualified for the overall requirement as well as the standalone requirements of DIADS and AWTEC.</p>
<p>In addition to the above market research, the Government considered breaking out those portions of the requirement where competition might be possible. The Government's analysis concluded that the breakout was not a feasible approach to meeting the requirement, nor would significant benefits be gained through competition as compared to the potential duplication of costs by having two contractors perform the requirement. Finally, experience with the current VIEWS contract, where a single contract vehicle has been utilized for the majority of EWG's capability upgrade support, including AWTEC and DIADS, has proven to be most efficient in its execution.</p>
<p>Based upon the results of the market research conducted, and the aforementioned Government analysis, the Government will acquire the services on a sole source basis. The resultant contract will be awarded under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency's Requirements.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) is planning for the acquisition of engineering services for the Advanced Technology Support Program IV (ATSP4), which will be the next in a highly successful series of engineering services Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The ATSP4 program will release two solicitations; one is a 100% Small Business Set-aside (HQ0727-15-R-0002) and the other is a Full and Open Competition (HQ0727-15-R-0001). The purpose of this announcement is to publicize the issuance of the solicitations. DMEA has established a web site located at: http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss, where an executive summary, notional schedule, and Virtual Industry Day Q&amp;A, designed to communicate additional procurement details. Posted information is non-binding and subject to change.
<p>ATSP4 is a uniform technical and management approach that leverages advanced technologies to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) for a quick reaction capability across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This capability includes the development of appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate sophistication level, or meet new threats. These efforts may include developing components to meet the DoD's requirements for ultra-low volumes, extending component availability, or ensuring a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics; also included will be the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements to DoD weapon systems in response to traditional and irregular (asymmetric) threats and to the problems related to aging weapon systems. Increasing warfighter capabilities and providing solutions to electronics support problems-such as, reliability, maintainability and obsolescence-are accomplished through the development and insertion of applications of advanced microelectronics technologies. The scope of ATSP4 covers both hardware and software and includes studies, analysis, design, software, simulation, prototyping, integration, testing, producibility, and limited production. The scope of ATSP4 also includes the development of viable methods and procedures for using available tools and resources, strategies for resolution of replacement alternatives, and technical interchange in support of task accomplishment.</p>
<p>Source Selection methodologies will be utilized which anticipates multiple awards for these indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contracts. DMEA anticipates making 6 - 10 awards for each of the two acquisitions, the Small Business Set-aside and the Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>In support of the Department of Defense paperless initiatives, all communications regarding this acquisition will be electronic.</p>

1.0   INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: 

This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11. The purpose of this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit capabilities from interested vendors.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a need to create a consolidated IT Integrated Service Center (ISC) whose capabilities include helpdesk services and may include equipment provisioning.  The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at present.  Information submitted in response to this Market Survey/RFI will be used by the FAA for informational, market research, and planning purposes only.  It may also be used to support the decision as to whether the requirement will be set aside for only small and/or small and disadvantaged businesses.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFI(s) and/or Screening Information Requests (SIRs) related to the ISC; if any are issued.

The helpdesk services will include, but are not limited to:

     	Incident, Problem, and Knowledge Management
     	Self service portal
     	Local Area Networks (LAN)
     	Peripheral devices
     	Personal computer (PC) workstations
     	Laptops
     	General office automation software
     	FAA-specific software
     	Electronic messaging system
     	Mobile devices
     	SharePoint (FAA KSN Knowledge Services Network)

Equipment provisioning may include all aspects of property management such as acquiring, configuring, deploying, tracking, maintaining, and decommissioning of equipment provided by the service desk vendor.  This equipment may include, but is not limited to the following:

       Individually Assigned:
           Laptops
           Desktops
           Printers
           Monitors
           Mobile devices:
              Blackberry
              iPads
              iPhones
              MiFi
       Organizationally Assigned:
           Printers
           MiFi devices
       Infrastructure Equipment:
           Infrastructure servers
           File/print servers
           Ancillary equipment (switches, routers, etc)

Additionally, the FAA is seeking information to better understand the following:

       Potential Help Desk/Equipment Provisioning Operating Models.
     	Emerging technologies and techniques that enhance delivery of Helpdesk/Equipment provisioning services. 
     	Tools, techniques, and metrics used to improve customer satisfaction.
     	Industry best practices, innovations, and lessons learned based on experiences providing Helpdesk/Equipment provisioning services.  

Areas of interest include:

     	A focus on the customer experience (vs traditional metric based customer satisfaction).
     	A service that is designed to incorporate continuous improvement.
     	SLAs that improve upon current market based SLAs with respect to customer satisfaction.
     	Where feasible, practical, and cost effective, a service that emphasizes remote solutioning of incidents (i.e., no permanent feet on the ground).
     	Self-service dashboards for metric reporting.

2.0   BACKGROUND:  

The FAA AIT organization is responsible for supporting the IT needs of the FAA and its external customers:  

     	Internal customers:
           Approximately 60,000+ customers geographically dispersed across the United States in 900+ site facilities, including nine Regional Offices and two Technical Centers, as well as 11 international offices. 
           Approximately 58,000 tickets generated from Government and contract employees per month in support of hardware, software, network ops, etc.

     	External customers:
           Approximately 1,000,000+ customers geographically dispersed across the world who access or utilize FAA safety systems.
           Limited support needs (e.g. application password resets) accounting for approximately 5,000 tickets per month.

The scope of services being provided by the existing AIT helpdesk(s) consists of Helpdesk and Deskside support services that include, but are not limited to: 

     	Local Area Networks (LAN)
     	Peripheral devices
     	Personal computer (PC) workstations
     	Laptops
     	General office automation software
     	FAA-specific software
     	Electronic messaging system
     	Mobile devices
     	SharePoint (FAA KSN Knowledge Services Network)
     	Asset Inventory
     	Lifecycle/Technology Refresh

All of the support services listed above are related to the non-National Airspace System (NAS) support networks/systems. 

The existing AIT helpdesk(s) utilize a Remedy ticketing system.  

3.0   Submittal Requirements and Instructions: 
  
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing a response to this Market Survey/RFI, and any costs associated with a Market Survey/RFI submittal are solely at the interested vendor's expense. 
 
Two documents are to be submitted: 1) Capability Statement, and 2) Business Declaration Form.  

3.1   Capability Statement  This submission should follow the suggested outline below and must be limited to no more than six (6) pages (any excess may be discarded). Please describe examples of your companys actual work experience focusing on the capability to provide support services to the agency as described in this Market Survey/RFI.  Respondents may identify work experience achieved by your teaming partners as well. Please limit discussion to relevant current or previous experience (within the last five years) addressing the following in your response:

Experience supporting and managing a fully outsourced 24x7x365 service desk:

     a.	 Technical and management capability to provide help desk and equipment provisioning services incorporating industry best practices, innovations, and lessons learned.
  
     b.  Relevant experience using/implementing enterprise IT service desk management software solutions.

     c.  Successful performance providing helpdesk services under a Performance Based contract with incentive arrangements on delivery and the application of a reward-penalty structure. Include metrics used to measure the performance of helpdesk support utilizing thresholds for improving customer satisfaction or wait times.

     d.  Experience in shifting tickets/calls from a right-to-left cost model that would allow for the resolution of more tickets at a lower tier of support.  Include any experience implementing a self-help portal.

     e.  Providing remote solutioning that would allow for fewer resources located at FAA facilities.

     f.	 Equipment provisioning - all aspects of IT property management such as acquiring, configuring, deploying, tracking, maintaining, and decommissioning of equipment for either a commercial or federal client.    

3.2 Business Declaration Form  This form is required by the FAA. 

4.0. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 

NAICS Code has not been determined at this time.  

5.0 Delivery of Submission:

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID. PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>This project will be advertised as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The tentative advertisement date is on or around&nbsp;February 13, 2015. Plans and specifications will be available at that time.</p>
<p>This project is located within Case Mountain Area of Critical Environmental Concern in Tulare County, California adjacent to Mineral King Road approximately 6.5 miles southeast of Three Rivers. This project consists of the replacement of the existing 50 foot long, one lane Kaweah Bridge over the East Fork Kaweah River and the deck and railing replacement of the adjacent 20 foot long 6 Mile Flume Bridge. The bridges are located on Case Mountain Road within Bureau of Land Management Lands, and provide critical access for fire management activities.</p>
<p>The existing Kaweah Bridge is an approximately 50 foot long structure composed of steel railroad flatcar repurposed into a 3 span bridge. The bridge site is located on Case Mountain Road approximately 1000 feet from the intersection of Mineral King Road.</p>
<p>The proposed replacement bridge is a 55-foot by 12-foot prefabricated steel bridge with glue laminated (glulam) deck panels, timber running planks, and steel thrie-beam rail. The contractor will be required to provide a fully engineered, simple span, single-lane, portable modular steel girder bridge. Steel fabrication will need to be completed by an AISC certified fabricator. The bridge will be founded on concrete spread footings to be placed behind the existing concrete piers and between the existing stone masonry wingwalls. Great care will need to be exercised during construction to avoid damage to the stone masonry wingwalls and to minimize required removal of the existing concrete piers.</p>
<p>The existing 6 Mile Flume Bridge is an approximately 20-foot long by 13.5-foot wide structure composed of steel wide flange girders supporting a timber deck. The proposed work will consist of removal and replacement of the existing timber decking, running planks, curbing and steel rail with glulam timber deck panels, glulam timber running planks, and timber rail. Both bridges will be closed to all traffic during construction. With the completion of the new bridges, both bridges which are currently load posted to 10 tons, will be brought up to current live load standards.</p>
<p>The Kaweah Bridge will require a 55-foot long pre-fabricated steel bridge and approximately 800 LB of reinforcing steel, 9 CUYD of structural concrete, and 45 CUYD of structural excavation. The 6 Mile Flume Bridge will require approximately 0.4 MFBM of glulam structural timber, 25 SQYD of glulam structural timber decking, and 32 LNFT of timber bridge railing.</p>
<p>This project is located within a sensitive location on BLM lands with site access provided by the narrow and winding Mineral King Road and the bridge provides critical access for fire management activities. All construction debris will need to be contained and kept out of the East Fork Kaweah River and 6 Mile Flume. Great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of bridge construction, timely completion of work, and minimization of impacts to natural resources.</p>
<p>The contracting range for this project is between $250 thousand and $500 thousand.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID. PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.</strong>
<p><strong>This project will be advertised on a Full and Open basis. The tentative advertisement date is on or around February 13, 2015. Plans and specifications will be available at that time.</strong><br /><br />Project Details: This project is located in Monterey County, California within Fort Ord National Monument adjacent to State Route 68 (Monterey-Salinas Highway) approximately 6 miles southwest of Salinas. This project consists of the replacement of the existing 125 foot long Guidotti Bridge over El Toro Creek.</p>
<p>The existing Guidotti Bridge is an approximately 125 foot long, single lane, 3 span filled concrete spandrel arch structure. The middle arch was constructed in 1908 and two exterior spans constructed in 1911. The bridge site is on Guidotti Road trail, a single lane gravel road, located approximately &frac14; mile from Badger Hill Trail head parking lot adjacent to State Route 68.</p>
<p>Guidotti Road and other roads and trails within Fort Ord National Monument experience high visitor use including pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians. The bridge will be closed to all traffic during construction but adjacent trail access will need to be maintained for visitors. Portions of the existing concrete structure, containing the original stamped bridge dates, are required to be sawcut and salvaged for incorporation into an interpretative display.</p>
<p>The proposed single-span bridge superstructure will consist of 4 adjacent prestressed concrete box beams with thin bonded epoxy overlay. The bridge will be founded on eight (8) driven steel H-piles (HP 14x89) extended approximately 50-feet deep into silty sand and sandy silt subsurface materials. A wave-equation analysis completed by an experienced professional engineer will be required prior to approval of pile-driving equipment. During pile driving operations great attention to detail will be required to ensure that the alignment is within &frac14; inch per foot and the piles are driven to within 3 inches of the required cutoff location.</p>
<p>This project will require approximately 4,100 LB of reinforcing steel (epoxy coated), 25 CUYD of structural concrete, 380 LNFT of driven steel H-piles, 392 LNFT of precast, prestressed concrete box beam, 200 LNFT of 54 inch high, combination steel and concrete bridge railing, 160 SQYD of thin bonded epoxy overlay, 225 CUYD of earthwork, and 300 CUYD of riprap.</p>
<p>This project is located within a sensitive location on BLM lands with high public visitation. All construction debris will need to be contained and kept out of the active channel at the bridge site and dewatering will be required for all work within the active channel. Great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of bridge construction, timely completion of work, minimization of impacts to natural resources, and visitor relations.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in February 2015 with construction occurring from April through August, 2015. THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID. PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.&nbsp; The anticipated contract value is between $.5 million and $1 million.</p>

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NFLC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure the review, evaluation, statistical analysis and trending of data reports and preparation of reports and presentations related to the ongoing requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) Patient Safety (PSP) and Quality Assurance Programs (QAP).  

The PSP/QAP services are requirements for all Joint Commission accredited facilities and their clinics both medical and dental as well as to designated fleet and marine sites plus the three Navy Dental Commands.  This support includes the requirement for the manipulation of multiple DoD and Navy federally protected databases.  

The major functions for PSP and QA include 1) Data Collection, Analysis, and Tracking; 2) Reporting; 3) Briefings, Meetings, Presentations and Communications.
 In addition to the above functions, the PSP program also requires the Training/Instruction task. Details about the individual positions are provided below. 

The PSP support, in addition to the data analysis and trending, serves as a subject matter expert for the database used by our 31 MTFs, engages in problem solving and serves as a consultant to the field for report design, searches, classification and other database questions and concerns.   Annually, there are over 13,000 events collected in the DoD Patient Safety Reporting (PSR) system, and 31 MTFs using the software.  

The quality analyst is engaged with review, evaluation, statistical analysis, and trending of data reports and preparation of reports and presentations from multiple data sets that address all of the quality measures for BUMED- the reports are then dispersed to the 31 MTFs for action.
  The QAP addresses The Joint Commission (TJC) ORYX and DoD Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures, evaluates and tracks seventeen perinatal measures and four surgical measures, plus  analyze and monitor trends for twelve TJC survey reports per year.   

The proposed procurement is being processed on a full and open competitive basis. The sources sought synopsis number was N000180143234. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 and the standard is $15.0M. 

The period of performance for the resultant contract will be 28 September 2015 through 27 September 2016, with four one-year option periods. 

A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated. The Government intends to use the policies contained in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.
  Quoters will submit a non-price submission and price submission as required by the solicitation. The non-price submission will be considered more important than price. Please do NOT submit questions until you have read the solicitation. 

This is not a Request for Quests. The solicitation/RFQ will be posted at a later date (RFQ N00189-15-Q-Z022). 

Interested parties should frequently monitor the NECO website for any updates and/or amendments.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Sustainable Technology Division (STD) located in Cincinnati, Ohio is developing a new data architecture for managing data related to life cycle assessment (LCA) that is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The RDF uses ontologies (linked vocabularies specific to a domain model) to structure data for new knowledge discoveries. This technology is the basis for semantic web data sharing and provides a powerful tool to integrate complex models such as near field exposure modeling and life cycle impact assessment. The key component of the desired system will be the underlying life cycle human exposure modeling ontology. An existing ontology called ECO is being implemented and extended to a limited extent in a stand-alone tool used for harmonizing different LCA datasets (LCA Harmonization Tool). Other ontologies for LCA have been prop osed or are under development. The appropriate connection of data when linking various domain models is vital for establishing an efficient database for rapid chemical assessment.
The scope of work covered under the Statement of Work shall include:
 1) Optimization of semantic technologies - The contractor shall provide sematic technology expert review of either existing or planned semantic technologies in US EPA?s LCA research group. These technologies include the application of RDF in the LCA Harmonization Tool (existing), the US EPA RDF-based expanded LCA database (planned), and a LCA web portal for the Federal Commons (planned) to be developed by US EPA.  
2) Refinement of a domain model ontology for Life Cycle Assessment - The contractor shall deliver an ontology with documentation of development describing a domain model for life cycle assessment using formats specified by the EPA COR.
3) Development of ontology linkages for domain models related to Life Cycle Human Exposure Modeling - The contractor shall deliver a report describing the optimal method for linking a LCA ontology with additional ontologies necessary for including Life Cycle Human Exposure Modeling in life cycle impact assessment.
This will be competed in accordance with FAR Part 13 procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order to one vendor for a duration of one year.  This requirement is anticipated to be a total small business set aside.  The NAICS code 541512, the size standard is $25.5 million. The request for quotation (RFQ) will be posted at the following website: www.fedconnect.net. It is the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the Fedconnect website for changes or updates. No hard copies will be available. All responsible small business sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>There is a need for a modern pressurized hydrant fuel system to adequately support fueling and defueling operations for large frame aircraft assigned to Robins AFB, Georgia.  The existing failing hydrant system is unreliable.  The fuel pits and lateral control pits cannot be sealed properly, causing them to collect rain and ground water.  The infiltration of water has corroded the hydrant adapters, piping, pumps, motors, and caused damage to the electrical components that support the hydrant system.  Obsolescence, coupled with extensive deterioration of piping, pumps, and control systems, makes any repair alternative infeasible. <br>   <br> Work will include construct a pressurized hydrant fuel system with 16 hydrant outlets.  Modify a pumphouse to provide 151 liter-per-second (2,400 gallon-per-minute) pumping capacity fuel filter separators, upgraded electrical system and automatic controls, and emergency generator.  Construct hydrant loop piping system with leak detection, cathodic protection, and pigging system.  Work includes site preparation and improvements, pavement, drainage control, supporting utilities, and physical security measures.  Demolish or decommission the existing hydrant system outlets, lateral control pits, piping and supporting infrastructure.  Project includes remediation of fuel contaminated soils. <br>

<SUBJECT>Provide a Validated Submarine Based Scheduling Tool for Incorporation into the Non-Tactical Data Processing System (NTDPS) within Virginia Class Submarines in Support of NMRC
<SOLNBR>N32398SUBSCHEDTOOL
<RESPDATE>021315
<CONTACT>NMLC Research Team, NMLC Research Team, Email NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to perform a research and development (R&amp;D) project in support of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD. The research project will fulfill a critical need to provide a validated submarine based scheduling tool for incorporation into the Non-Tactical Data Processing System (NTDPS) within Virginia Class Submarines. The estimated period of performance of the project is 30 months. <br /><br />The validated submarine based fatigue-based scheduling tool is a follow on effort performed by Pulsar Informatics, Inc., and funded by both the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Advanced Medical Development (AMD) Program. Pulsar Informatics (Pulsar) is the only company that has integrated submarine-specific operational challenges and directly addressed the needs of submarine operations. No other examples exist that have addressed the impacts of interrupted sleep and rapidly changing operational tempo for watchbill generation for submarine crews, an entirely novel and particularly challenging problem for the submarine force. Pulsar is the only entity to have conducted the prior, ONR and AMD funded effort, which successfully created a proof of concept software architecture to 1) monitor submariner training qualifications; 2) track individual watchstander work/rest cycles; 3) integrate information from watch sections to design "watchbills" comprising multiple watch section; and, 4) optimize submarine crew schedules by providing fatigue countermeasures and real-time capability to immediately adjust rescheduling of watchbills. <br /><br />The two main objectives of the anticipated project are to: (1) transition and perform a knowledge transfer of the submarine-specific scheduling system into the new Virginia Class Submarine NTDPS system (named NOSIS); and (2) create a fatigue assessment component and fatigue meter dashboard for the Pulsar stand-alone software tool. In addition to the primary two tasks, a final field evaluation, validation and fine tuning of the software product will be required prior to implementation. <br /><br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Pulsar Informatics, Inc.; Philadelphia, PA 19104, for the performance of the described requirement. <br /><br />Pulsar Informatics (Pulsar) created a US Navy Submarine-specific-scheduling and fatigue system as one previously did not exist. This submarine-specific tool captures individualized fatigue-based scheduling that can scale up from the individual watch-stander at the watch station to the watch sections' integration of fatigue. Their efforts have culminated in a stand-alone software tool. It is the only tool that includes watch station breakdown, along with watch section integration of the information. In this system, fatigue components are based on individual Submariners, which makes it the only software on the market that has accounted for submarine watch-stander positions while providing the ability to build and redesign watch schedules in real time. Additionally, Pulsar has produced the only submarine-specific scheduling and fatigue mitigation software. All these points indicate that Pulsar is qualified and has the capability to perform the work successfully.<br /><br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page and shall be submitted in 12 point, Times New Roman font. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.<br /><br />Capability statements are due by 12:00 PM Local Time, February 13, 2015. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>Research Opportunities in Space And Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2015 "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences - 2015 (ROSES-2015)," will be available on or about February 16, 2015, at <A HREF="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2015">http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES201 5 </A>	 . This omnibus NASA Research Announcement (NRA) solicits proposals for basic and applied research and technology in support of NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD). ROSES is an omnibus announcement, with many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics and all together these cover all aspects of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, including, but not limited to: theory, modeling, and analysis of SMD science data; aircraft, scientific balloon, sounding rocket, International Space Station (ISS), CubeSat and suborbital reusable launch vehicle investigations; development of experiment techniques suitable for future SMD space missions; development of concepts for future SMD space missions; development of advanced technologies relevant to SMD missions; development of techniques for and the laboratory analysis of both extraterrestrial samples returned by spacecraft, as well as terrestrial samples that support or otherwise help verify observations from SMD Earth system science missions; determination of atomic and composition parameters needed to analyze space data, as well as returned samples from the Earth or space; Earth surface observations and field campaigns that support SMD science missions; development of integrated Earth system models; development of systems for applying Earth science research data to societal needs; and development of applied information systems applicable to SMD objectives and data. <p> Awards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The funds available for awards in each program element offered in this NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which allow selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals, depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intraagency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. Unless otherwise stated the rules in the Guidebook for Proposers Responding to a NASA Research Announcement are the default, but ROSES takes precedent where there are differences. Any changes or modifications to any of the guidelines in this Summary of Solicitation will be specified in the descriptions of the relevant program elements in the Appendices of this solicitation. <p> Details of the solicited program elements will be given in the Appendices of this NRA. Proposal due dates will be given in Tables 2 and 3 of this NRA, which will be posted at <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>	, and for which links are provided below. Interested proposers should monitor <A HREF="http://Grants.gov">http://Grants.gov </A>	  or <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>    and subscribe to the SMD electronic notification system there for additional new program elements or amendments to this NRA through February 2016, at which time release of a subsequent ROSES NRA is planned. A web archive (and RSS feed) for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to ROSES-2015 will be posted at: <A HREF="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2015/">http: //nasascience.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2015/ </A>    . This NRA will be available upon its release at <A HREF="http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2015">http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES201 5 </A>	 . <p> Further information about specific program elements may be obtained from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element in the Appendices of this ROSES NRA, and questions concerning general ROSES NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001; E-mail: <a href="mailto:sara@nasa.gov">sara@nasa.gov </a> ; Telephone: 202-358-0879.

<DESC>There are many challenges facing our world today: Finding a cure for cancer; discovering safer and cleaner alternative energy sources; making transportation safer and more effective; producing durable, environmentally friendly materials; protecting our national assets; exploring Space, and rehabilitating our soldiers, just to name a few. <p> NASAs Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) shares common, complex problems with many industries. We are seeking partners interested in using our unique composite pressure vessel testing and evaluation technical capabilities to help solve both space related and earthbound problems. <p> For the past 50+ years, this nation has made a great investment in space exploration and NASA JSC, resulting in JSC capabilities (disruptive technologies, expertise, knowledge, specialized skills, experience, facilities, labs and tools) that are used to better life here on Earth. Utilizing these national assets to further technological advances also saves money, not only for the taxpayer, but across industry, academia, and Government agencies. In todays global economy, the key to our nations future is dependent on our ability to advance technologies in all industries and operate in the most innovative, efficient and effective ways. <p> With the release of this Announcement, JSC looks forward to sharing its unique capabilities to meet the needs of others.

Respondents are cautioned to mark any information confidential if it is to be treated as proprietary.   <p> IV. Oxygen Systems Testing and Analysis Capabilities <p> The NASA JSC White Stands Test Facility (WSTF) specializes in the study of oxygen compatibility in space, aircraft, medical, and industrial applications. We investigate the effects of increased oxygen concentration on the ignition and burning of materials and components used in these applications. When high-pressure oxygen is present in an application, there are fire hazards that must be assessed and mitigated to ensure personnel and system safety. Fires have occurred in space, such as in the Mir Space Station, and in aircraft life support, medical applications, aerospace applications, construction materials, and oxygen production. Typically, fire hazards are associated with the presence of ignition sources and with materials incompatibility. <p> At WSTF, we perform compatibility assessments to identify potential problems within oxygen systems. We test materials and components to determine their suitability for use in oxygen systems. We also perform postfire failure analyses to identify the cause of a fire and can recommend design criteria to avoid future problems. <p> Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems <p> Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems, a two-day course aimed primarily at those who design systems, was the 1998 Recipient of the Education Award for Excellence from the American Society of Association Executives. The course is taught by WSTF personnel at NASA centers and other facilities worldwide and can be customized to the specific needs of any oxygen user. <p> Oxygen Systems: Operation and Maintenance <p> Oxygen Systems: Operation & Maintenance is a half-day course designed for those who assemble, operate, and maintain oxygen systems. The course is taught by WSTF personnel at NASA centers and other facilities worldwide and can be customized to the specific needs of any oxygen user. <P>

Respondents are cautioned to mark any information confidential if it is to be treated as proprietary. <p> IV. Hypervelocity Impact Test Capabilities <p> The NASA JSC White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL) is an access-controlled hazardous test area capable of simulating Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris impacts on spacecraft materials and components. This unique NASA facility was designed to safely handle and test hazardous targets, and simulates impacts on shields, spacecraft, satellites, and spacesuits. Four Two-stage Light Gas Guns (2SLGGs) propel single 0.05 mm to 22.2 mm diameter projectiles to velocities in excess of 7.5 km/s. <p> Because of WSTFs remote location and attention to safety, the RHTL is capable of implementing test programs that propel projectiles at toxic or explosive materials and components such as batteries, aerospace fluids, and pressurized containers in a controlled laboratory environment. Release energies up to 2.3 kg (5 lb) TNT equivalent can be accommodated within the facilitys sealed target chambers. <p> At the WSTF, there are 1 inch, .50 caliber, and .17 caliber guns. Firing these guns requires an extreme amount of energy release, thus requiring the facility to be remotely located, housing underground bunkers and following access control protocol. <p> The two-stage gun uses standard smokeless gunpowder as its first stage and highly compressible gas for the second-stage to launch the projectile package. The smokeless powder charge sends a polyethylene piston at 2500 feet per second down the pump tube, compressing hydrogen gas. The tapered high-pressure coupling section collects the gas until the pressure ruptures a stainless steel petal-valve, accelerating the launch package down the barrel. In the evacuated expansion chamber a stripper plate separates the launch package by capturing the sabot as the projectile proceeds in free flight to impact the test sample. <p> Various high-speed cameras are used, some capable of 200 million frames per second, to capture the target impact and debris cloud. Because of the speed of the projectile, measuring the velocity requires the use of laser intervalometers (automated shutter devices). The data acquisition must operate at a greater bandwidth to capture the diagnostic information from the light detectors and temperature, pressure, and shock measurement.

Respondents are cautioned to mark any information confidential if it is to be treated as proprietary. <p> IV. Propulsion Test Capabilities <p> The NASA JSC White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) offers numerous ambient pressure and altitude stands to test rocket propulsion test systems as well as single rocket engines. Propellant capabilities include hypergolic and liquid oxygen/hydrocarbons. Both propellant and test article temperature conditioning is available, as well as the capability to provide saturated propellants to the test article inlets. <p> Six test stands provide vacuum test capability to altitudes greater than 100,000 ft (30,000 m) and three test stands provide ambient testing to an altitude of 5000 ft (1500 m) above sea level for the NASA, government agencies, and commercial industry. <p> Altitude Testing <p> Six test stands at WSTF provide vacuum test capability: <P> Engine and engine systems up to 25,000 lbf (110 kN) thrust <P> Altitude greater than 100,000 ft (30,000 m) engine firing with steam ejectors up to 250,000 ft (76,000 m) using vacuum pumps without firing <P> Propellants: liquid hydrogen, gaseous and liquid oxygen, hydrocarbon, hydrazine, Aerozine-50, monomethylhydrazine (MMH), nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), gaseous and liquid methane <P> Solid motors <P> Helium pressurants <P> Nitrogen pressurants <P> Vertical or horizontal firing <P> Temperature-conditioned propellants and test article, 40 to 120 F (4 to 49 C) <P>  Ambient Testing <p> Three test stands at WSTF support ambient firing at 5,000 ft (1500 m) above sea level: <P> Thrust from 25,000 to 60,000 lbf (110 to 270 kN) <P> Vertical or horizontal firing <P> Articulating thrust mounts <P> Hypergolic Propellants: hydrocarbon, hydrazine, Aerozine-50, MMH, N2O4, or solid rocket propellant <p> <P> Propellants <p> Propellants available for testing include liquid hydrogen, gaseous and liquid oxygen, hydrocarbon, hydrazine, Aerozine-50, monomethylhydrazine (MMH), nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), gaseous and liquid methane and solid rocket propellants. <P> Unique Propulsion Testing Capabilities and Expertise <P> Combustion instability and Pogo Determination <P> Dynamic oscillations in spacecraft engines and systems can often lead to disastrous results. Two of the more common oscillation phenomena are called combustion instability and POGO. The NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) maintains the capabilities to initiate instabilities by several methods for evaluation purposes and to test for engine instability and system POGO under a wide range of conditions. <p> <P> Hypergolic Propellant Handling <P> WSTF can dispatch propellant handling teams to support projects at any location.  The WSTF maintains expertise with Hypergolic propellants such as hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine , nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine. <p> <P> Engine Testing with Saturated Propellants <P> Spacecraft propulsion systems are often required to operate with propellants saturated with pressurant gas. This can negatively affect both engine and system performance. The NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) maintains systems capable of rapid propellant saturation, verification of the gas saturation level, and capabilities for engine and system tests utilizing saturated propellants. These tests can be conducted over a wide range of conditions. <P> <p> Propellant Tank Pressure, Volume and Temperature Quality Gauging <P> Due to the inherent inaccuracies of flight-type propellant gauging systems, the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) has demonstrated the capability to determine the liquid level in a propellant tank by means of a pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) application that uses monomethylhydrazine (MMH) as the liquid. <P> <p> Propellant Vapor Detection <P> White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) has an active program in development, evaluation, and qualification of toxic vapor monitors for ground support and spaceflight. Through several on-going test programs, WSTF has developed advanced methods of producing stable toxic and/or highly reactive gas streams from the parts per billion to the percent level in a variety of carrier gases. In conjunction, the methods for quantitatively trapping and analyzing these gas streams were developed. The gold salt hydrazine detector currently used in the space station and shuttle airlocks was invented, developed, and flight qualified at WSTF. <P> <p> Rocket Engine Performance Measurement <P> One of the goals of rocket engine hot-fire testing is to directly evaluate engine performance for the purpose of validating analytical design parameters or flight worthiness. Different performance parameters can be measured depending on customer requirements. The White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) performance measurement capabilities include vacuum thrust, mass flow rate, propellant pressure, and standardized performance parameter calculation for comparison to nominal engine performance. <P> <p> Propulsion Test Data Acquisition and Control Systems <P> The Propulsion Test Office at White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) currently operates the second generation of automated Data Acquisition and Control Systems (DACS). These systems have proven their merit in tests of space shuttle components, including the improved auxiliary power unit, orbital maneuvering subsystem, aft reaction control subsystem, and a myriad of reaction control thrusters. Custom control and monitoring software has also been developed and implemented for such applications as safely establishing closed loop startup and shutdown profiles for a liquid propellant rocket engine with turbopump feed system. <P> The four DACS incorporate current computing technology features for efficient and safe testing. <P> Extensive use of both high-speed memory networks and standard network communications allows for safely automated test operations and the distribution of test results in near real-time. <P> Graphical user interface technology provides optimum test article telemetry monitoring and control system interaction. The DACS provides customer data processing and analysis service both in real-time for test control and monitoring at WSTF, and posttest at the customers place of business. All improvements have resulted in reductions of both maintenance costs and energy usage. <P> The Propulsion Test Office at WSTF recently procured and installed the third generation of automated DACS that is designed and built on lessons learned with the previous generations. The following information reflects this third generation system. <p> <P> Training <p> WSTF can provide hands-on training to customer personnel in handling hypergolic propellants.

<DESC>There are many challenges facing our world today: Finding a cure for cancer; discovering safer and cleaner alternative energy sources; making transportation safer and more effective; producing durable, environmentally friendly materials; protecting our national assets; exploring Space, and rehabilitating our soldiers, just to name a few. <p> NASAs Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) shares common, complex problems with many industries. We are seeking partners interested in using our unique Propellants and Aerospace Fluids Testing and Analysis testing technical capabilities to help solve both space related and earthbound problems. <p> For the past 50+ years, this nation has made a great investment in space exploration and NASA JSC, resulting in JSC capabilities (disruptive technologies, expertise, knowledge, specialized skills, experience, facilities, labs and tools) that are used to better life here on Earth. Utilizing these national assets to further technological advances also saves money, not only for the taxpayer, but across industry, academia, and Government agencies. In todays global economy, the key to our nations future is dependent on our ability to advance technologies in all industries and operate in the most innovative, efficient and effective ways. <p> With the release of this Announcement, JSC looks forward to sharing its unique capabilities to meet the needs of others. Partnering will foster innovation through collaboration, assist in solving complex problems relevant to life on earth and create a more efficient and effective Government. <p> Interested parties should respond in accordance with the language provided in the Announcement. <p> I. Description and Purpose of this Announcement <p> NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) seeks to identify potential partners for utilization of JSC's unique Propellants and Aerospace Fluids Testing and Analysis resources to support government, university, and commercial activities. These resources include technical expertise, knowledge, specialized skills, experience, facilities, labs, and tools not reasonably available in the commercial sector. These resources are frequently referred to as capabilities throughout this document. These capabilities can be of great benefit to the nation by enhancing technological research and development, increasing the nations economic vitality, expanding human knowledge, and preserving United States critical skills. <p> These capabilities, as outlined in Section IV, have broad application within diverse industries including, but not limited to, energy, petrochemical, medical, transportation, advanced manufacturing, robotics, aerospace, commercial space, and first responders. The capabilities also have broad application in academia and other government agencies (e.g., Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security). <p> This NASA JSC Announcement of Unique Capabilities, hereafter referred to as Announcement, is solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided. Since this is an Announcement, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to the respondents. <p> The expectation is that NASA JSC will be fully reimbursed for all costs incurred in the performance of work as described in the agreement. The purpose of this Announcement is to engage prospective partners in dialogue leading to research and development (R&D) efforts utilizing these unique capabilities. In selecting potential partners, JSC will assess the best-fit use of its resources consistent with the NASA mission. <p> II. The Process <p> The government and partner will jointly define the partnership, develop mutually agreed to statements of work, cost, and schedule. The government anticipates some respondents may be interested in only one area or sub-area while others may be interested in broad efforts requiring more than one capability. Some entities may want to partner because of their direct needs, or there may be respondents who wish to utilize JSC capabilities to meet the needs of third parties. NASA will identify the appropriate legal instrument for partnering on a case-by-case basis. <p> III. Information Requested from Respondents <p> If interested, parties will submit statements of interest electronically, via email, to the Technical Point of Contact listed below. The statement of interest shall consist of a one-page summary and an additional one page of supporting detail if needed. The one page summary response form can be found here. Responses shall contain a minimum font size of 12.

<DESC> <br> THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of Market Research conducted by the Missouri National Guard to identify potential Contractors, and if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. <br> The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 561210 which maintains a corresponding Size Standard of $38,500,000.00 in annual revenues. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all businesses to include 8(a), small business and small disadvantaged business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.  <br>  <br> This Sources Sought is to notify companies that the Missouri National Guard is seeking sources to provide aviation weather monitoring services with equipment as follows: <br>  <br> 1.	General: This is a non-personal services requireemnt to provide Missouri Ready 2015 with contractor support to provide Simulated Structure Collapse Services (SCVS) reset. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. The NGB J3/7 provides the Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB) with subject matter expertise on joint doctrine, training, education, and exercises to ensure a trained and balanced National Guard force ready to support any mission of the several States or Combatant Commanders. <br>  <br> Description of Services/Introduction: The Contractor shall provide all personnel, utilities, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and any other item the contractor requires, to provide a vital realistic element to the Missouri Ready 2015 as defined in this Performance Work Statement. Contractor is responsible for all items except for those items specified as government furnished property and services. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract. <br>  <br> 1.1	Background:  In conjunction with the National Guard Bureau (NGB), Missouri NG is tasked to develop and support regional training and exercise activities aimed at enhancing domestic contingency readiness. Missouri NG ensures these functions are integrated and complementary where appropriate. NGB uses Structure Collapse Simulators (SCS) to simulate the collapsed state of buildings due to a natural disaster or a domestic terrorism event.   The use of these simulator venues supports regional training and exercises to enhancing domestic contingency preparedness exercises and evaluations of CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP), Homeland Response Force (HRF) and other CBRNE response capabilities.  A Structure Collapse Venue Site (SCVS) is a location where one or more SCS are used to simulate the collapsed state of buildings. <br>  <br> 1.2	Scope: The contractor shall provide SCVS reset for Missouri Ready 2015. Personnel assigned to this task shall possess the skills and expertise necessary to perform assigned tasks associated with this order. <br>  <br> 1.3	Objectives: This Performance Work Statement (PWS) establishes performance requirements for contractor tasks necessary to reset SCVS.  These simulators were built  to be  realistic, challenging, and maintainable, to  provide the  needed skill  lanes.    The training venues provide strategic and  tactical skills  challenges of  such  complexity that repetitiveness does not  breed familiarity with  the  training prop  and  training lanes.  The SCVS is of sufficient size  and  complexity to keep the Search and Extraction (S&E) teams training in  a realistic condition and  environment  so  individuals gain valuable experience  and   expertise working on  a  simulated  quote mark real  world quote mark  structure  collapse. <br>  <br> 1.4	Period of Performance: <br>  <br>  	Phase-In Period: 14-18 March 2015 (Preparation for Contract Performance) <br>  	Contract Period:  19-20 March 2015 (Exercise) <br>  	Missouri Ready 2015 After Action Review:  21 March 2015 (Contract Manager Only) <br>   <br> 1.5	General Information <br>  <br> 1.6.1	Quality Control:  Quality Control is the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor is responsible for the delivery of quality services/supplies to the Government (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.246-1, Contractor Inspection Requirements). The Contractor shall develop, implement and maintain an effective Quality Control System which includes a written Quality Control Plan (QCP).  The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services. The QCP shall implement standardized procedure/methodology for monitoring and documenting contract performance to ensure all contract requirements are met. The Contractors' QCP must contain a systematic approach to monitor operations to ensure acceptable services/products are provided to the Government.  The QCP, as a minimum, shall address continuous process improvement; procedures for scheduling, conducting and documentation of inspection; discrepancy identification and correction; corrective action procedures to include procedures for addressing Government discovered non-conformances; procedures for root cause analysis to identify the root cause and root cause corrective action to prevent re-occurrence of discrepancies; procedures for trend analysis; procedures for collecting and addressing customer feedback/complaints. The contractor shall provide to the Government their quality control plan to Contracting Officer or their designated representative within 5 working days prior to the Contract Phase-In period. After acceptance of the quality control plan the contractor shall receive the Contracting Officer's acceptance in writing of any proposed change to their QC system. <br>  <br> 1.6.2	Quality Assurance: The Government shall evaluate the Contractor's performance under this contract in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. This plan is primarily focused on what the Government must do to ensure that the Contractor has performed in accordance with the performance standards.  It defines how the performance standards will be applied, the frequency of surveillance, and the minimum acceptable defect rate(s). <br> 1.6.2.1	Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP): The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will monitor contractor performance and complete the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan Worksheet (Ref Part 7, Attachment 7.8) at the end of the contract period of performance or annually.

A quality rating may change from  quote mark Green quote mark  to  quote mark Red quote mark  without notice. We anticipate the COR utilizing the  quote mark Yellow quote mark  quality rating to alert the contracting office of quality issues that have the potential for a  quote mark Red quote mark  quality rating if corrective action is not taken. If the performance rating for any task in this order is  quote mark Red quote mark  during any time in the performance period, the COR will notify the Contracting Officer. <br> Rating	Description <br> Green	Yes, performance and technical specifications are being met at AQL. <br>  <br> Yellow	Yes, performance and technical specifications are currently being met at the minimum AQL, but the following service / deliverable needs contractor attention. <br> The Customer must identify what component of the deliverable and/or service requires attention. <br>  <br> Red	No, performance and technical specifications are not being met at AQL and the following service / deliverable needs immediate contractor resolution. <br> The Customer must identify what component of the deliverable and/or service is below the minimum AQL. <br>   <br> 1.6.3	Hours of Operation: The Contractor is responsible for providing services in accordance with the hours and dates included in Part 7, Attachment 7.4, unless Government facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings, or similar Government directed facility closings.

<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) notice. It is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The Department of Commerce, Office of the Inspector General (OIG), seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing E-mail Records Management Solution. This RFI is being posted by The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses. The Government is considering a NAICS code of 518210 with a size standard of $30.0M.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the service that can meet OIG's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement. A small business set-aside decision may be made as a result of the information received. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, 8(a), WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>Draft Requirement:</p>
<p>The OIG is developing a requirement for the following: (located at HCHB 1401 Constitution Ave., NW Washington, DC 20230)</p>
<p>OIG is seeking information in the form of capability statements from vendors who can assist us to meet the requirements of two joint issued memorandums from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) M-14-16, "Guidance on Managing Email" (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2014/m-14-16.pdf) and the M-12-18, "Managing Government Records Directive." These two memorandums gave agencies specific deadlines to implement electronic recordkeeping of e-mail and other records formats for temporary and permanent records. The "Managing Government Records Directive" (M-12-<br />18) mandated that agencies implement records management of e-mails, which are federal<br />records by a deadline of December 31, 2016. To assist you in providing us the information we seek we are providing the following link: (http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/prmd.html).</p>
<p>Currently, OIG is using Outlook on an Exchange 2010 platform with BlackBerry Enterprise<br />Service version 5.0 as the mobile device solution. There are approximately 350 e-mail boxes,</p>
<p>predominantly used by the 160 federal employees, group e-mail lists, and 30 contractors. We have approximately 85 BlackBerry devices and a plan to implement Smart-phone capabilities. OIG recently awarded a contract for a FedRAMP approved cloud email and migration is<br />expected to be completed by September 30, 2015. OIG is seeking information on e-mail records<br />management solutions that would integrate with OIG's FedRAMP approved cloud email that are<br />either FedRAMP approved, if in the cloud, or that can be hosted at OIG, if not in the cloud. The<br />information on OIG's General Support System is designated Sensitive But Unclassified or<br />Controlled Unclassified Information.</p>
<p><br />Requested Information/ Questions for Capability Statements to Address:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1. Vendors are hereby requested to submit a capability statement that addresses their ability to assist OIG in meeting the goals of the directive through automation.

On short notice, any ship could require repair/maintenance and the prime would be expected to be there and support. It is not uncommon for primes to have teaming partners to handle such needs. In other words, management responsiveness is essential for success as the prime. What is your company's strategy for surge/emergent requirements?</span></p>

Also, the Prime Contractor will coordinate all work with the NSA, Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY), to ensure that the proper integration plan is in place in order to prevent the violation of nuclear work boundaries. The prime will need to integrate schedules with customers such as Type Commander (TYCOM), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Ship's Force, and I-level work etc. All work must be properly integrated, scheduled and managed. The Prime Contractor needs to have a sound plan for managing subcontracts as well. What is your company's integration strategy in regard to managing subcontractors?

The accounting system would show the breakout of direct, indirect and overhead charges. In addition, the accounting system would be used to manage the business with vendors as required. While it is important to have an integrated schedule; it is equally important to have cost controls in place. The prime will submit timely invoices/vouchers to the Navy by Contract Line Item (CLIN), Contract Subline Item (SLIN), and ACRN level.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY: This is a Sources Sought request for information to be used for market research purposes, only. The Government is conducting market research to assist in determining the existence of small business manufacturers of scientific vacuum pumps. The Government is seeking responses from all businesses capable of manufacturing the required item(s). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE or PROPOSAL. Responses to this announcement are not considered quotes or offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The government shall not be held responsible for any costs incurred in response to this sources sought announcement. Participation is strictly voluntary. Information is also being requested through the Federal Register. See <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-01-28/html/2015-01622.htm">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-01-28/html/2015-01622.htm</a>.
<p>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION<br />Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule<br /><br />AGENCY: U.S. Small Business Administration.<br /><br />ACTION: Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Scientific Vacuum Pumps.<br /><br />SUMMARY: The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Scientific Vacuum Pumps. On October 1, 2014, SBA received a request that a class waiver be granted for scientific vacuum pumps under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 333911 (Pump and Pumping Equipment Manufacturing), Product Service Code (PSC) 4310 (Compressors and Vacuum Pumps). According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply this class of products to the Federal government. Thus, SBA is seeking information on whether there are small business scientific vacuum pump manufacturers. If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified small businesses to supply the products of any manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) small businesses, Women-Owned small businesses (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned small businesses (EDWOSB), or Participants in the SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) program.</p>
<p>DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted by February 12, 2015.<br /><br />ADDRESSES: You may submit comments and source information to Amy Garcia, Procurement Analyst, Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416; or by way of email to the Nonmanufacturer Rule Waiver program office at NonMfgRuleWaiverReqsts@sba.gov. Email communications should contain "Class Waiver - Scientific Vacuum Pumps" in the subject line.</p>
<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Ms. Amy Garcia, Procurement Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-6842; by FAX at (202) 481-1630; or by way of email to the Nonmanufacturer Rule Waiver program office at <a href="mailto:NonMfgRuleWaiverReqsts@sba.gov">NonMfgRuleWaiverReqsts@sba.gov</a>.</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8(a)(17) and 46 of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 637(a)(17) and 657s, and SBA's implementing regulations require that recipients of Federal supply contracts set aside for small businesses, SDVO small businesses, WOSBs, EDWOSBs, or Participants in the SBA's 8(a) BD Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. 13 CFR &sect; 121.406(b), 125.15(c). Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market. <br /><br />In order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. 13 C.F.R. &sect; 121.1202(c). The SBA defines "class of products" based on the Office of Management and Budget's NAICS. <br /><br />The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Scientific Vacuum Pumps, under NAICS code 333911 (Pump and Pumping Equipment Manufacturing), PSC 4310 (Compressors and Vacuum Pumps). The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for the product within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Register and on FedBizOpps.gov. More information about the Nonmanufacturer Rule and Class Waivers may be found on SBA's website at https://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/contracting/contracting-officials/non-manufacturer-waivers</p>

<DESC>Labor Market Survey: Pursuant to FAR 22.503 addressing projects within the scope of Executive Order 13502, USACE districts will need to undertake a labor market survey as part of their PLA evaluation process. Each task order may be evaluated on a project by project basis for possible PLA application. USACE district PDTs should consider the following:
<p>1. Issuing a Sources Sought Notice:<br />The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction&nbsp;community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:</p>
<p>100% SDVOSB Set-aside Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) in support of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Project Description: Contract work will consist of projects which may include, demolition, renovation, repair and/or new construction for facilities such as administrative facilities; academic facilities (applied and general instruction); base support and facility maintenance shops; physical fitness centers; vehicle maintenance and engine repair shops; lodging facilities (barracks, dormitories, and officers quarters); food service facilities; public safety facilities (police, fire and crash rescue); airfield structures (hangars, air traffic control towers, and may or may not include rigid and flexible paving); and research development and testing facilities at JBMDL, New Jersey and throughout the North Atlantic Division of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The major items of work to be performed under this contract include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Earth work construction, repairs and alterations; roads, parking lots, sidewalks, bridges, firing ranges, runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking aprons<br />&bull; Exterior facility construction, repairs, and alterations; doors, windows, brick facade, EIFS, siding, cast stone, block, and roofing systems (metal, shingles, single ply, and built-up).<br />&bull; Interior facility system construction, repairs, and alterations; electrical, piping, HVAC, communications, fire suppression, fire detection, and floor, wall, &amp; ceiling finishes.<br />&bull; Exterior utility system construction, repairs, and alterations; electrical, sanitary, storm, water, gas, and communication distribution.<br />&bull; Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project.<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project. PLAs are permissible pre-hire agreements under sections 8(e) and (f) of the National Labor Relations Act, which authorizes the use of these agreements between labor organizations and employers engaged primarily in the building and construction industry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Since USACE is not an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry, USACE will neither negotiate nor become signatory to a PLA.</em></span></p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation?</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br /><br />3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>6. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>7. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non- use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described 100% SDVOSB Set-aside Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) in support of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the 100% SDVOSB Set-aside Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) award?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor- management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor<br /><br />for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?</p>
<p>g. How will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals?</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email to Gregory Keaton, Contract Specialist, at<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gregory.C. Keaton@usace.army.mil </span>&nbsp;no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on&nbsp;10 February 2015.</p>

<a href="mailto:antoinette.r.aquiningoc.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Edgewood</a>
<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br>  <br> 1. PURPOSE.  The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), Joint Project Manager Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPMNBCCA) and the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC) Detection Branch is requesting responses from industry on their willingness to participate with ECBC and JPMNBCCA in a multi day technology review and nondestructive testing.  ECBC and JPMNBCCA are interested in determining the  quote mark portability quote mark  of commercial mass spectrometers to be interfaced with ECBC's ABOid Algorithm (e.g. having the algorithm work with different types of commercial Mass Spectrometers) for microbial detection and identification.  The limited 1-3 day testing would encompass industry coming to ECBC with their candidate Mass Spectrometers to collect spectra on pre-prepared biological samples.   The spectral outputs from the systems would then be analyzed using ECBC's ABOid Algorithm for microbial identification.   The Industry provided Mass Spectrometers would have to be capable of performing tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS analysis) covering a mass range between 300-2000 amu and requires a minimum of 100 MS/MS spectra (with as little operator intervention as possible). JPMNBCCA and ECBC will use the information resulting from the tests to optimize the Mass Spectrometer performance and interface requirements, as well as the ECBC's ABOid algorithm.  Results from the test will also guide future overall acquisition strategies.  <br>  <br> 2. BACKGROUND. US Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) has developed an innovative algorithm known as Agents of Biological Origin Identifier (ABOid). The ABOid algorithm can analyze mass spectra signatures and provide a microbial identification and classification output. Results are color-coded to highlight anything that could be considered a pathogen and whether it is toxic. For sequenced organisms, ABOid is capable of providing strain level identification, which is significant in that one can then reveal important diagnostic information for medical countermeasures. The JPMNBCCA has currently fielded the Joint Portal Shield (JPS), a fixed site biological warfare detection and identification system to multiple military bases in South Korea and the Middle East. The JPS is a networked system that can detect and identify up to ten biological warfare agents in less than 25 minutes. The JPS sensor is housed within Tricon shipping containers that provide commercial power and environmental conditioning. The JPS has been active in the field for 15 years and has become expensive to maintain and operate due to obsolescence issues. The JPMNBCCA is considering replacing the JPS sensor with a Biological Mass Spectrometer working in conjunction with the ABOid algorithm. This new system could be housed in the existing JPS Tricon, leveraging existing infrastructure and communications. <br>  <br> 3. TECHNOLOGY REVIEW DESCRIPTION.  Based on the information provided in response to this RFI, the Government may enter into a Vendor Demonstration Agreement with the individual responders. This Vendor Demonstration Agreement will request industry to provide a Mass Spectrometer and operators for a multi day technology review. For the purposes of this technology review, the Mass Spectrometer will be provided processed biological samples. The output of the Mass Spectrometer will interface with the ABOid algorithm. The result from the ABOid algorithm will be analyzed. Results will be kept confidential and only shared individually with the owner of each system. The Mass Spectrometer will potentially be challenged against representative non-lethal pathogens and toxins in 1-2 concentrations range from the following categories in a pure buffer as well as potentially in interfering buffers/additives: <br>  <br> a.  Vegetative Bacteria Cells. <br> b.  Spore forming Bacteria. <br> c.  Virus.  <br> d.  Toxin. <br>  <br> At the conclusion of the non-destructive testing, the Government will provide a report of the vendor's performance. <br>  <br> 4.  INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS.   <br>  <br> a.

The purpose of this interface document is to provide the interface parameters required for data from a mass spectrometer to integrate with ABOid software. <br>  <br> 1.1	Background <br> The ABOid software was developed by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) for identification of biological samples.  The Joint Project Manager, Nuclear Biological Chemical, Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBC CA) will use ABOid software to identify biological organisms from mass spectral data from participating systems.  <br>   <br> 1.2	Reference Documents - None. <br>  <br> 2.0	INTERFACE CHARACTERISTICS <br>  <br> 2.1	ABOid System Interfaces <br>  <br> 2.1.1	Utilize mass spectrometer capable of providing tandem mass spectrometry in positive mode that can cover a mass range between 300-2000 amu. <br>  <br> 2.2	Proteomics Based Solution Details <br>   <br> 2.2.1	Solvent: PBS, Ammonium bicarbonate, and/or either buffer in 0.1% Triton-X <br>  <br> 2.2.2	Concentration: The biological samples will be in concentration ranges of 10E7-10E3 cfu/mL for bacteria, 10E7-1E3 cpu/mL for virus, and 10 ng-0.1ug for toxins. Volume: Sample volume will be approximately 250 uL of processed microbial samples that contains tryptic peptides. <br>  <br> 2.3	Proteomics Based Sample Preparation/Digestion <br>  <br> 2.3.1	ECBC will process and prepare the microbial samples and will provide to the participating vendor (in ECBC's lab) to analyze by their operator(s) using their mass spectrometer. The sampling process will include lysis, isolation and preconcentration of proteins followed by denaturation and digestion of the proteins. The digested sample will be provided to the participant vendors of the mass spectrometers. <br>  <br> 2.3.2    If the Vendor has an established sample preparation protocol that can generate tryptic peptides from microbial samples, then such protocols can be used prior to the Mass spectrometry analysis by their candidate MS instrument. It should be noted that using vendors' preparation protocol will be measured against ECBC's sample protocol and processed samples from both ECBC and vendors will be analyzed on bench-top mass spectrometry instrument to measure their efficiency in the identification of the microbes and the number of peptides generated by each mentioned sample preparation protocols. <br>  <br> 2.4    Data Input Details <br>  <br> 2.4.1	ABOid requires a minimum of 100 MS/MS spectra (with as little operator intervention as possible). A recommended approach is as follows: <br>  <br> 2.4.1.1	Introduce tryptic peptide sample to MS instrument <br>  <br> 2.4.1.2	Acquire a full MS spectra <br>  <br> 2.4.1.3	Perform analysis on the full MS spectra and select all MS peaks that are over an acceptable S/N ratio. <br>  <br> 2.4.1.4	Acquire MS/MS spectra for all selected MS peaks defined in 2.5.1.3.  <br>  <br> 2.4.2	Repeat steps 2.5.1.2 thru 2.5.1.4 until a minimum of 100 MS/MS spectras are obtained.  To achieve this requirement, another full MS followed by MS/MS analyses may be required. This can be achieved through the reanalysis of the same sample until such minimum requirement is met. <br>  <br> 2.4.3	ABOid requires output from 2.5.1 in a single Comma Separated Value (CSV), DTA format or similar ASCII text file.   <br>  <br>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>AVOX - SS-OFR-15-0022</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) intends to make award to AVOX, as subsidiary of Depositary Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), 55 Thomson Place, Boston, MA 02210, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for legal entity reference data.</p>
<p>OFR Researchers require access to AVOX's product for accurate, up-to-date classification of the financial counterparties to credit default swaps (CDS) in order to build financial monitoring tools requested by FSOC and to carry out its research mission. Classification of counterparties into banks, pension funds, government entities, etc. is necessary for measuring net and gross volumes of risk accumulated in swaps by different groups in order to assess areas of relative risk and the channels through which risk might propagate through the system in the case of a financial shock. In addition, classification of financial counterparties enables OFR researchers to assess behavior of different financial entities in response to market events in order to predict responses in the market to financial shocks and in order to measure changes shifts in collection of risk in the market. OFR's existing access to CDS transactions and positions is provided by the DTCC, which is the only repository of such transaction-level data, so the classification of counterparties must match to DTCC firm ID numbers so that they can be used together with the transactional and positional data already at OFR. Additionally, AVOX is also under procurement by SEC researchers working with DTCC CDS data. In order to coordinate monitoring and research outputs with those of the SEC, OFR researchers need to rely on the same classification source as the SEC.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than 1400 (2:00pm ET) February 11, 2015. Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: MWOMACK, MFORBES.REF SS-OFR-15-0022. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested requirement. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to Avox.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors must provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.). Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>2. Whether your services are available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.</p>
<p>3. A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers your company currently provides these products/services for.</p>

<p>Politico Pro - SS-OFR-15-0021</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) intends to make award to Politico Pro, 1100 Wilson Blvd., Suite 601+, Arlington, VA, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for legal entity reference data.</p>
<p>OFR Researchers require access to Politico Pros product for accurate, up-to-date hyper specific policy news service that offers its subscriber's exclusive insider coverage on news stories, morning newsletters, afternoon briefings, and customized breaking news alerts on the Hill votes, committee meetings, newly introduced legislation, and financial services regulations. The service provides the ability for users to track laws and regulations before they are finalized by providing early and valuable behind-the-scenes information. While there are other news services that provide tracking of legislation and lobbying efforts such as CQ Roll Call, Amercian Banker, and BGOV, none provide the level of granular coverage that Politico Pro provides. Politico Pro has a uniquely structured reporting staff that has 5-10 reporters dedicated to each policy area. Due to such a large reporting staff, Politico Pro is able to provide more granular coverage of the back and forth discussions that occur before a law or regulation is finalized. Politico Pro is the only source with the early and valuable behind the scenes information that is essential for OFR to respond quickly and plan strategy to newly introduced legislation. This coverage cannot be provided by comparable news outlets or vendors. Politico Pro and the information therein can only be purchased through Politico Pro representatives; it is not available anywhere else.</p>

<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1) and 5.201, this is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract, and is not a request for proposals. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Office of Chief Procurement Office (OCPO), Acquisition Operations Division, Preparedness Section, 16825 S. Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, MD, 21727-8998, intends to award a sole-source contract to CNA Corporation, for a bridge contract to continue exercise evaluation support services until the award of a new competitive acquisition is completed for these services.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all necessary contract personnel, materials, service, equipment and facilities to moderate high seismic risk by providing expert consulting services, program evaluation, research and analysis, partnership development, outreach and educational materials, and regional support.</p>
<p>The time allotted before the existing contract expires is not sufficient to solicit new bids or proposals for continuity of services prior to the expiration of the existing evaluation contract. Furthermore, an interim "bridge" contract is necessary to maintain continuity of mission-critical services while allowing time to make competitive award(s) for future services. For this support, FEMA OCPO intends to award a contract to the incumbent contractor CNA Corporation, having a six (6) month base performance period, and having a (6) month option period, for an overall potential performance period of (12) months. The proposed contract is for the continuation of services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government, and information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government/FEMA will not be responsible for paying for any of the costs incurred and associated with the development of any responses submitted to this posting. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541611.</p>
<p>Questions or comments concerning this announcement may be submitted to FEMA OCPO by 10:00 AM Eastern Time, February 13, 2015 to: Ms. Amanda Heller, Contract Specialist via e-mail: amanda.heller@fema.dhs.gov. Phone calls will not be accepted.</p>

<p><br />MK 58 MOD 1 Description:</p>
<p>The MK 58 MOD 1 Marine Location Marker is cylindrical, a maximum of 21.70 inches long and 4.94 inches in diameter. The marker weighs 11.50 pounds (+ /- .50 pounds). The center of gravity is 7.93 +/- .50 inches from the base end of the marker (non-arming end of unit). Upon water submergence, a MK 72 MOD 1 water activated battery is activated. Current from the battery initiates a MK 13 MOD 0 electric Squib, which ignites starter composition of the first red phosphorous (RP) pyrotechnic candle. This starter composition ignites the starter pellet which in turn ignites the first RP candle. When the first candle is nearly burned out, its heat ignites transfer time fuses which carries ignition to the second candle starter composition. This starter composition initiates the second RP candle in the same manner as the first. The required burn time is between 40-60 minutes. The marker is armed by removal of an adhesive backed metallic foil strip. A pull ring removes the foil strip. A replaceable protective cover protects the ignition end of the marker in shipping and handling.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.  This sole source contract is required for Winter Flounder Collection for the FLEES Project.   <br>  <br> Contractors for this work must demonstrate experience specifically in the collection of wild winter flounder brood stock in the geographic region of the Gulf of Maine, as well as in vitro spawning and egg incubation success. Demonstrated field knowledge of site-fidelity for adult flounder is required, as well brood stock collection methods, and field identification of fish ready for reproduction. <br>   <br> Adult brood stock must be kept in flow-through marine aquaria of sufficient size to ensure they thrive. Experience with strip spawning techniques is essential, including egg fertilization and post fertilization techniques to ensure eggs successfully reach the egg membrane hardening stage. Fertilized eggs must be stored with in appropriately sized, covered, flow-through filtered marine aquaria (salinity above 28 ppt) with temperatures below 10 C. Fertilized eggs must be inspected daily using a dissecting microscope to ensure high fertilization success and that normal development is occurring.  This process will be repeated two more times, for a total of three eggs batches numbering a minimum of 3,000 eggs in each batch. Eggs must be shipped overnight to the US ACE testing facility. A final report detailing this process will be the final project deliverable. <br>  <br> The contractor will be required to file Letters of Acknowledgement with NOAA and comply with new NOAA permitting processes for the collection of wild winter flounder for research purposes, including: (1) filing the permit, (2) demonstrating the research nature of the work; (3) executing the permit conditions; and (4) submit a permit compliance report to NOAA at the completion of the collection.  <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of other qualified sources that can meet the requirements identified above.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent.  <br>  <br> All responses received within 15 days of the posting of this notice, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br> Submit any inquiries within 15 days of the posting of the notice of intent via email: erin.e.bradley@usace.army.mil (list W912WJ-15-Q-0071 in the subject line of the email) or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: Erin E.

However, one other firm desired interest in performing SDVS support by replacing all existing SDVS with a new system.

However, interested contractors may submit a narrative describing their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort via e-mail to Contract Specialist, TSgt Micael Jiggetts, micael.jiggetts@us.af.mil and Contracting Officer, Robert Gable, robert.gable.3@us.af.mil no later than 2:00 PM CST 13 Febuary 2015. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent to Sole Source.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The US Army Armament Research and Development Command (ARDEC) Benet Laboratories, located at Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, New York is seeking capability statements from firms that can provide the U.S Government with pneumatic equipment, air compressors, compressor replacement parts, and maintenance servicing for efficient operation of machinery for use in R&D programs.  Products include, but not limited to, hoses, air compressors, fittings, cylinders, pistons, and valves.  The procured equipment is used in such programs as base plate testing to ensure there are no defections during manufacturing that could cause premature failure and potentially harm Army personnel.  Spare parts include, but not limited to, pressure gauges, couplers, and regulators.  All pneumatic products, including spare and replacement parts, should be compatible with existing Ingersoll Rand Air compressors.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>

The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>

<p>(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<CONTACT>Donald Tinsley, Contract Specialist, Phone 530-478-6121, Fax 530-252-6126, Email dtinsley@fs.fed.us
<DESC><br />To implement an emergency aerial mulch treatment with Certified Weed Free Rice Straw to restore soil cover in critical High and Moderate Soil Burn Severity areas of the King Fire and reduce increase in flood flows, and sediment delivery on the Eldorado National Forest, Georgetown Ranger District and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) lands permitted by the Forest Service. Applications will be done aerially to slopes 15 to 60%. Mulching will reduce downstream peak flows by absorbing and slowly releasing overland runoff which is likely to be increased due to reduced soil cover and hydrophobic soil conditions. Mulching will also help to protect the native seedbed and retain moisture on the burned slopes to facilitate quick vegetative recovery of the treatment areas.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, using Streamlined Procedures For Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number is HSCG85-15-R-P45824 is issued as a Request for Proposals. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-79. This is a total small business set-aside. The NAICS Code applicable to this procurement is 721110 with a size standard of $30M for the requirement. The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis. To receive an award, the Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to: Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. S.W. Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692.</p>

Replacement products will be shipped/delivered FOB Destination directly to the VHA location at no additional cost to the Government.

<DESC>FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING DRAFT SOLICITATION. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.
<p>1. This pre-solicitation notice is being posted for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback concerning the attached DRAFT Solicitation. Response to the request for questions is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a Final Solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. The request is for final planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>2. This requirement is to provide a full range of responsive environmental remediation actions necessary to protect human health &amp; the environment. It includes rapid response and removal of environmental media contaminations and site restoration activities located on Base Realignment and Closure Bases (BRAC) in EPA regions 9 &amp; 10 (Western). The BRAC Environmental Construction and Services Requirements Contract (BECSRC) is being contemplated to include a 5 year ordering period with 24 additional months for performance completion of services.</p>
<p>3. The purpose of soliciting and awarding this Requirements Contract is to have a tool in place for "pop-up" interim Environmental Remediation requirements. "Pop-ups" are unplanned, out-of-cycle requirements that occur periodically, but erratically on installations included in the BRAC Program Management Division portfolio. The BRAC Program Management Division, responsible for remediation and transfer of Air Force property affected by BRAC legislation, manages the disposal of Air Force property in accordance with BRAC law and the BRAC Master Plan to achieve early environmental resolution and early property disposal to return value to the Air Force and local communities. Requirements contracts are set up with one contractor to provide service (FAR 16.503). Generally speaking, an IDIQ obligates the Government to a minimum quantity/dollar amount at the time award, while a Requirements Contract guarantees the contractor no such minimum. <br /><br />4. The contracting officer will conduct this source selection using a phased evaluation process which is sometimes referred to as a "down-select." To make the process more efficient, the contracting officer is limiting the amount of information that offerors must submit initially. The contracting officer shall notify offerors promptly in writing when their proposals are excluded from the competitive range or otherwise eliminated from the competition after which Evaluation Notices (ENs) will be sent to offerors within the competitive range as needed. Those offerors considered by the Contracting Officer to be within the competitive range will be asked to submit the Volume III (Pricing) and Volume IV (Sample Task Order) in Phase II of this source selection.<br /><br />5. All questions/comments pertaining to the DRAFT RFP shall be provided to the Government for consideration in the provided matrix Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet has a field for Section/Attachment Number, Applicable Region, Page # / Paragraph Reference and Question/Comment. Please ensure that both sheets and fields are completed in their entirety. <br /><br />The Government is specifically requesting industry input on the adequacy and feasibility of the BECSRC Western Pricing Matrix which includes tabs for Deliverables, Unit Pricing, and Labor Rates.</p>
<p>6. Request for Questions: The Government anticipates a final solicitation to be released 12 Feb 2015; however, this is subject to change depending on the amount of questions we receive. This notification is provided to allow early review of DRAFT solicitation documentation for this requirement. <strong>Questions concerning the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) and attachments are due by 4:00 PM CT on 6 Feb 2015 to: Mr. Richard Compton at <span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><a href="mailto:richard.compton.4@us.af.mil">richard.compton.4@us.af.mil</a>.</span><br /></strong><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Jonathan Swall (<a href="mailto:jonathan.swall.1@us.af.mil">jonathan.swall.1@us.af.mil</a>) and Contract Specialist, Mr. Richard Compton at <span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><a href="mailto:richard.compton.4@us.af.mil">richard.compton.4@us.af.mil</a>.</span></p>

<p>DFAS 52.223-9000, "ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS" (July 2013)</p>
<p>The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government's policies on Green Contracting. FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government's policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals. Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products. EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials. Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) required federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products. Moreover, it required that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009), required federal agencies to analyze internal processes and revise reporting requirements in order to achieve such results as improvement of water use and efficiency, promoting pollution prevention and elimination of waste. But more particularly as related to procurement, an emphasis was placed on efforts to advance sustainable acquisitions to ensure that 95 percent of new contract actions including task and delivery orders, for products and services with the exception of acquisition of weapon systems, are energy-efficient (Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated - FAR 52.223-15, and -16 when specific to computer products), water-efficient (Goals within Executive Order 13514), bio-based (FAR 52.223-1 &amp; -2), environmentally preferable (FAR 52.223-10) and/or Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT - FAR 52.223-16) certified, non-ozone depleting (FAR 52.223-11), contain recycled content, or are non-toxic or less-toxic alternatives (FAR 52.223-3 &amp; DFARS 252.223-7006), where such products and services meet agency performance requirements.</p>
<p>&sect; 1. Mandatory Use of Paper and Other Products with Recycled Content.</p>
<p>(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor affirmatively acknowledges that it will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm. In addition, by responding to this solicitation the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items (FAR 52.223-17).</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Notice of Green Alternatives in Offerors' Product/Service.</p>
<p>(a) When offering a product or service that contains "Green" components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products, and provide the certification required by FAR 52.223-4, when required.</p>
<p>&sect; 3 Affirmative Duty of Contractors to Adhere to Green Contracting Policy.</p>
<p>(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.</p>
<p>(b) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>Answer:<br /><br />If the OSHA or ACI test requires&nbsp;NIST to do this on an annual basis, NIST will remove the floor plugs to allow full access and travel of the crane hooks to the lower levels for complete inspection of the limits and wire rope. <br /><br />This type of test will be required to be completed during a scheduled shutdown when access to these controlled spaces are available. NIST will provide shutdown timeframes upon award.</p>
<p>NIST is installing a floor decking which will impede this test in the Guidehall. A section of this decking will have to be removed to perform this test on the Guide Hall crane after March 2015. <br /><br />The due date for quotations is extended as follows:<br /><br />From: January 29, 2015<br /><br />To: February 3, 2015&nbsp; by 3:30 pm eastern. <br /><br />All other terms remain unchanged.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is to evaluate the existing tank level indicating system and make upgrades to the Control Room monitoring equipment, while making the optimum use of the existing system equipment, namely the in tank equipment.  It is intended to eliminate the Control Room meters and the need for calibration as well as to maximize the alarm functionality.    <br>    <br>  The existing Tank Level Indication system consists of all of the equipment necessary to monitor 30 individual tanks aboard the Dredge MCFARLAND.  All of the in-tank equipment are Gems Sensors.  <br>    <br>  The Control Room equipment consists of two-(2) panels of 15 meters each.  Each panel is (Height-32.25 quote mark  X Width-24.5 quote mark  X Depth-13 quote mark ).  Each meter has a low level alarm light and a high level alarm light.  Each panel has an integrated audible alarm to sound in conjunction with any of those thirty-(30) alarm situations (60 alarm situations when considering both panels). Each panel has an alarm audible acknowledge button to clear whatever audible alarm condition is present.  <br>    <br>  Vendors responding should be prepared to provide a solution to the specified areas:  <br>    <br>    <br>   	 Automated, real time indication of contents of all thirty-(30) tanks    simultaneously displayed on Control Room screen/screens in the same location as that vacated by existing meter panels.   <br>   	High and Low level alarm functions for each tank.  <br>   	Audible and visual alarm annunciation, clearly indicating alarm situation and tank involved.  <br>   	Ability to acknowledge audible and visual alarms separately, but if the alarm condition self clears, the audible and visual alarm will not clear until acknowledged.    <br>   	Ability to program and set alarm time delay, individually for each tank so as to account for nuisance tripping during swash conditions around alarm set point.  <br>   	System components should be industry standard, as 'commercial off the shelf' as possible in order to increase maintainability of the system.  Replacement components should be easily obtainable.  <br>   	After Contract award and completion of system installation all plans, drawings, operating manuals and component cut sheets shall be deliverables of the Contract.  Three-(3) copies of each shall be furnished.  <br>   	List of recommended spare parts should accompany Design documentation.  <br>   	System shall be fully tested to the satisfaction of the Government (Due to the fact that entry into the tanks will not be available, the Government will accept +/- 5% as compared to current tank soundings).  Ship's force can assist in transferring tank contents to facilitate testing, but other testing (alarm features) may require the Contractor to simulate conditions in order to verify proper system operation.  <br>   	Provisions for training the Ship's crew in all aspects of System operation & programming, to include troubleshooting for repair, shall be provided as part of Contract Award.  <br>

<DESC><strong>Information to Offerors:</strong> The following paragraphs address numerous questions asked in response to the recently posted presolicitation notice.<br /><br /><strong>Period of Performance and Final RFP date:</strong> The anticipated period of performance for CLOIS has changed from the original draft versions which showed a 1 Oct 15 start date. You may have noticed this in your review of the updated TEP worksheets. At this time, it is anticipated that the phase in period for CLOIS will begin 1 Dec 15 and run through 29 Feb 16. Full performance of CLOIS would then begin 1 Mar 16. While the performance period is changing, this does not mean the RFP will be delayed. The presolicitation notice was issue in anticipation of being able to issue the final solicitation in the very near future. In order to allow industry to be prepared for issuance of the Final RFP, the notice advices that you should not expect it any earlier than 15 days from the date the notice was posted. As discussed during industry days, the proposal period has been set for 45 days. Combining these two facts, you can deduce that the earliest date proposals may be due would be 60 days from 27 Jan 15.<br /><br /><strong>Draft Documents versus Final Documents:</strong> Numerous documents have been previously uploaded to FBO. These documents were draft and cannot be used as the final solicitation. This DOES NOT mean the information in them is invalid. Final documents should mirror very closely with the documents you received in draft form. Several PWS appendices are undergoing minor revisions in response to industry questions. In most cases, the responses to the questions will allow you to see where the change was made. All documents must be reposted in final form with the final solicitation. The same type of documents which were in the restricted area of FBO for the draft documents will be in the restricted area for the final solicitation. If you do not already have access to a restricted access document and anticipate needing it for the final solicitation, you should request access now to speed the process once final documents are released.
<p><strong><br />Instructions for requesting access to the FINAL Solicitation Documents:<br /></strong><br />1) All parties interested in viewing the Solicitation documents must be registered on FBO.<br />2) Parties must request access via FBO to view/download the restricted access portion of the Solicitation package.<br />3) Parties who have already provided a completed Restricted Access Request Form will not need to go any further. If FBO requires a new authorization, we will use your previously submitted form to grant access once you request it. However, you must request access to the restricted access area documents when they are posted in order for us to have a means to give you access. If you do not do this step, we have no means of connecting you to the restricted documents. <br />4) Parties who have not previously provided a completed Restricted Access Request Form and received access MUST send an email to cartama.ramoscrafton@us.af.mil AND candon.haynicz@us.af.mil requesting the FBO Restricted Access Request form.<br />Fill the form out, sign it and return it in order to receive access. You must request access to the restricted access area documents in order for us to have a means to give you access. If you do not do this step, we have no means of connecting you to the restricted documents. Completing the process from form initiation to obtaining documents can take several business days. Please plan accordingly so your access is in place before the final documents are released.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong> Answers to previously asked questions on the DRAFT documents are continually being worked and will continue to post to the Special Notice leading up to the posting of the FINAL Solicitation documents. Once the Solicitation is posted all Questions must be pertaining to the Final Documents.</p>

<p><strong>CAC hosts Force 2025 and Beyond Human Dimension Realistic Training Industry Forum at Fort Leavenworth</strong></p>
<p>FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - The Combined Arms Center (CAC) will hold an industry forum to discuss how to prepare the Army of 2025 and Beyond, and seek assistance from industry's senior leaders in creating tough, realistic training.</p>
<p>The forum will take place from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Feb. 5 2015 at the Frontier Conference Center, 350 Biddle Blvd., Fort Leavenworth.</p>
<p>To build the Force of 2025 and Beyond, the Army is looking for innovative ways to use current and future technologies to enable training that replicates today's complex operational environment and prepares units to win in a complex world.</p>
<p>Two keynote speakers will address the Army's future training efforts.</p>
<p>Lt. Gen. Robert B. Brown, Commander of the Combined Arms Center, will talk about executing realistic training in support of the Human Dimension Concept. Realistic training replicates the physical, social, and cultural aspects of combat and integrates ambiguous problems requiring innovative solutions.<br /><br />Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Director of the Army Capabilities and Integration Center, will discuss the Army of 2025 and Beyond. Force 2025 will require land power concepts and capabilities for the Joint Force as integrated and innovative solutions within Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF).<br /><br />Their speeches will be followed by two senior leader panels discussing:</p>
<p>&bull; The complex operational environment, Force 2025 and Beyond, and desired realistic training.</p>
<p>&bull; The evolution of training toward one live-synthetic training environment and the Army's modernization challenges in enabling realistic training today.</p>
<p>These topics were discussed at similar engagements at an Association of the United States Army convention and the Inter-Service/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference.</p>
<p>Registration for this event is closed. An official recording of the event will be available on the CAC-T web site shortly after the Forum. <br /><br />CAC, Fort Leavenworth, is a major subordinate headquarters of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. It has often been referred to as the "Intellectual Center of the Army."</p>
<p>CAC develops and integrates Army leader development, doctrine, education, lessons learned, functional training, training support, training development, and proponent responsibilities in order to support mission command and prepare the Army to successfully conduct unified land operations in a joint, inter-agency, inter-governmental, multinational environment.</p>

Some of the existing piping will be left in place and receive new supports and new insulation and some pipe sections will be completely removed and replaced. The project will require abatement of the old insulation, vault demolition and replacement.

<CONTACT>Eric J. Brandenburg

<a href="mailto:FEMP@ee.doe.gov">FEMP@ee.doe.gov</a>
<DESC>DE-SOL-0006380 - ENERGY INDUSTRY DAY - PERFORMANCE CONTRACTING, BEING HELD AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
This FEDBIZOPS notice, regarding DE-SOL-0006380, has been updated to include date, location and time information for a series of five Energy Industry Day - Performance Contract events taking place in February, March, and April 2015 across the U.S.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), intends to host a series of Energy Industry Day events to facilitate discussions of partnering opportunities between small businesses and Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) on current and possible future requirements.
These Industry Day events are not mandatory, and non-attendance will not preclude vendors from responding to any future Request for Proposals that the Government may issue.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with attendance or participation at the Industry Day events and no procurement or source selection sensitive materials will be disseminated at the events.
The DOE, through the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), has an ongoing requirement for multiple Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to design, install, implement, maintain, repair, and provide financing for the development of energy, water, and renewable energy conservation measures at federally owned facilities across the nation.  As part of these projects, the ESCO is responsible for conducting a comprehensive energy audit and identifying improvements that would save energy and/or reduce utility bills at each facility.  In exchange, the ESCO receives a share of energy savings that directly result from the implementation of such measures.  The series of Industry Days will provide DOE with an opportunity to present an overview of energy savings goals to industry, specifically the building trades.  It is anticipated that opportunities will exist for building trades to participate alongside the ESCO when projects come into fruition.  
Targeted North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes include but are not limited to:
221320 Sewer systems 237130 Transformer station and substation, electric power, construction 237130 Electric light and power plant (except hydroelectric) construction 238210 Electrical Contractors 238210 Environmental Controls Installation Contractors 238210 Electrical equipment and appliance installation 238310 Building insulation contractors 333415 Air-Conditioning and Warm Air Heating Equipment and Commercial and Industrial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing 334413 Semi-conductor and Related Device Manufacturing 334512 Automatic Environmental Control Manufacturing for Residential, Commercial, and Appliance Use 335100 Electric Lighting Equipment Manufacturing 335312 Motor and Generator Manufacturing 335999 All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing 541380 Thermal testing laboratories or services 561990 Electrical meter reading services, contract 924110 Waste management program administration
These Industry Days are structured as a free resource to provide ESCOs and small business the opportunity to meet and confer regarding possible opportunities.  The anticipation is that ESCOs? subcontracting plans will be more readily met through early engagement with a pool of capable business partners in advance of any defined requirements.  These events are also intended to foster communication and promote opportunities for networking and future subcontracting between interested industry parties and the ESCOs.
No procurement or source selection sensitive materials will be disseminated by the Government at these events.  No information shared by attendees shall be considered source selection sensitive materials.  The Energy Industry Day events are part of ongoing Government Market Research for planning purposes only.  
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and the Government will not award any contract on the basis of this Notice.
Who should attend:  ESCOs and other utility and energy contractors and subcontractors interested in large scale utility and/or energy projects.  Space will be limited and each vendor will be restricted to two (2) representatives per company, per event.

On short notice, any ship could require repair/maintenance and the prime would be expected to be there and support. It is not uncommon for primes to have teaming partners to handle such needs. In other words, management responsiveness is essential for success as the prime. What is your company's strategy for surge/emergent requirements?</span></p>

The prime is expected to work with many different vendors, subcontractors and customers to ensure a successful availability and ability to provide a high quality product through sound Engineering practices, technical expertise and Program Management. Also, the Prime Contractor will coordinate all work with the NSA, Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY), to ensure that the proper integration plan is in place in order to prevent the violation of nuclear work boundaries. The prime will need to integrate schedules with customers such as Type Commander (TYCOM), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Ship's Force, and I-level work etc. All work must be properly integrated, scheduled and managed. The Prime Contractor needs to have a sound plan for managing subcontracts as well. What is your company's integration strategy in regard to managing subcontractors? What is your company's specific experience in working with the Public Shipyard and meeting the requirements of Norfolk Naval Shipyard for working in the Controlled Industrial Area? What is your company's specific experience with integrating non-nuclear work with Norfolk Naval Shipyard's managed Integrated Master Schedule? What is your company's specific experience working on nuclear powered vessels and managing nuclear interfaces to prevent the violation of nuclear work boundaries?</span></p>

The accounting system would show the breakout of direct, indirect and overhead charges. In addition, the accounting system would be used to manage the business with vendors as required. While it is important to have an integrated schedule; it is equally important to have cost controls in place. The prime will submit timely invoices/vouchers to the Navy by Contract Line Item (CLIN), Contract Subline Item (SLIN), and ACRN level. Cost of performance shall be segregated, accumulated, and invoiced to the appropriate ACRN categories. What accounting system and other best practice accounting methodology does your company currently use?</span></p>

All repairs, maintenance and modernization have Integrated Logistic Support (ILS). This means the ship and Navy receives the proper technical documents after upgrades have occurred and respond accurately and timely to the volume of Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRLs). What is your company's experience with ILS with respect to meeting the Government's requirements for CDRLs?</span></p>

<DESC>This notice is being amended to extend the due date for responses to 2/4/2015 at 9:00 am EST.
PLEASE NOTE:  The purpose of this RFI/Sources source is to aid the Social Security Administration in market research and procurement planning.  There is no solicitation at this point.  Please do not submit questions regarding the potential solicitation.
Again, this notice is strictly for market research and procurement planning purposes only.  Information obtained from vendors will be used in procurement planning for any resultant solicitation.  This includes but is not limited to determining whether a set aside is appropriate or determining if existing contract vehicles exist that may be appropriate. It is not necessary to respond to this notice in order to submit a response to any resultant solicitation.  However, note that there is no guarantee that any resultant solicitation will procured on a full and open basis.  
*ATTENTION: This is a Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice. It is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Request for Information ? Representative Payee Site Reviews Comprehensive Program Support
The Social Security Administration (SSA) is performing market research to identify potential sources that have the availability and capability to provide planning, oversight, monitoring, and execution of the Representative Payee Expanded Monitoring Program. Your responses to the information requested will assist SSA in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy.
Purpose: The Social Security Administration (SSA) is exploring the possibility of a single vendor to provide all centralized administration and act as the principal provider in a major effort to enhance and consolidate the Representative Payee Monitoring program.
Background: Social Security benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments provide an important lifeline for millions of elderly and disabled Americans, survivors of deceased workers, and millions of young children. From the early days of our programs, Congress recognized that not all beneficiaries are able to manage their benefits. Therefore, in 1939, Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative payees (payee) to receive and manage benefits or payments on behalf of those beneficiaries or recipients. For more information on the Representative Payee Program, visit http://www.socialsecurity.gov/payee/index.htm.  We presume all legally competent adult beneficiaries or recipients are capable of managing or directing someone else to manage, the benefits or payments to which he or she is entitled. We prohibit the direct payment of benefits or payments to legally incompetent adult beneficiaries or recipients and to children under age 15. If we determine an adult beneficiary or recipient is not capable of managing or directing someone else to manage his or her benefits or payments, we select a representative payee for him or her.
Once we appoint a representative payee, we monitor and assess the performance of a payee. We look for indications that the payee is not performing his or her duties adequately. Often when we discover that a payee is performing poorly, we can help the payee correct the poor performance by re-educating the payee about his or her duties and responsibilities, including the need to keep adequate financial records. If appropriate, we will remove a poorly performing representative payee. 
With the exception of certain state mental institutions, all representative payees are required to submit an annual report accounting for the use of beneficiary or recipient funds. We review these reports and investigate those payees who provide questionable responses. 
In addition to the annual accounting process, we monitor representative payees? fiduciary performance through an on-site review process. Some of these reviews are required by statute, and others are discretionary. We conduct these reviews to determine whether payees are performing their payee duties and responsibilities satisfactorily, and complying with our rules. The reviews include examination of financial records and supporting documentation. 
Scope of Potential Requirement: The contractor would conduct and report their findings of the representative payee reviews.  The contractor would be required to conduct and report on more reviews incrementally, for the first three years of the contract.
The following outlines SSA?s anticipated implementation plan for the contractor, regarding the number of representative payee reviews to be conducted and reported on throughout the first three years of the contract:
Year 1 (Base) ? 1,000 Organizational Payees & 400 Individual Payees (1,400 total )
Year 2 (Option Year 1) ? 2,000 Organization Payees & 1,000 Individual Payees (3,000 total)
Year 3 (Option Year 2) ? 2,600 Organizational Payees, 1,270 Individual Payees, 780 Fee for Service (FFS) Payees, 50 State Mental Hospitals, 300 Quick Response Reviews (5,000 total)
The contractor would be responsible for providing the following services and be responsible for the following duties during a representative payee review:
?  Interview the payee about how they handle the beneficiary or recipients funds, how they determine a beneficiary or recipient?s needs, and any services they provide; ?  Review the payees banking procedures (including accounting system and bank account titling), financial records, and documentation of how they managed the sampled beneficiaries or recipients Social Security payments; ?  Conduct home visits for all beneficiaries or recipients selected for review as determined by SSA. For all other beneficiaries or recipients, conduct home visits for all beneficiaries or recipients selected in the review sample; ?  Interview the sample of beneficiaries to confirm information provided by the payee, verify large or unusual purchases noted during the financial review, ask if the payee is meeting his or her needs, and if there are any problems with the payee; ?  Refer suspected cases of abuse or neglect, health or safety, housing, or wage related issues to the appropriate agencies. The contractor must provide us with the date of the referral, the name of the referral agency, contact information for the agency, and any referral or allegation number, if provided by the agency; and ?  If the beneficiaries are in immediate danger, the contractor will contact the appropriate authorities and SSA immediately.
The contractor would also be responsible for the following:
?  Train payees on recordkeeping practices and money management when the payee has recordkeeping problems; ?  Send a closeout letter to the payee when the review has no deficiencies and provide a copy of the closeout letter to SSA; ?  Conduct  follow-up activities to ensure deficiencies, such as minor recordkeeping or bank account titling issues have been corrected; ?  Notify us about issues that affect program eligibility or payment amount; ?  Send a final report to us documenting the results of the review, resolved deficiencies, third-party referrals, and deficiencies requiring our action; and ?  If the contractor discovers potential misuse, the contractor will notify SSA and we will determine if the contractor should conduct a review of all beneficiary or recipients served by the payee during the suspected misuse period.
The contractor would also be responsible for reporting, tracking, and data collection:
?  SSA would  require the contractor to develop, manage, and maintain a secure web-based data collection system to collect and track the representative payee reviews; and/or ?  Have the ability to deliver encrypted electronic copies of the database and data collected as needed to SSA.

<DESC>There is a need for a modern pressurized hydrant fuel system to adequately support fueling and defueling operations for large frame aircraft assigned to Robins AFB, Georgia.  The existing failing hydrant system is unreliable.  The fuel pits and lateral control pits cannot be sealed properly, causing them to collect rain and ground water.  The infiltration of water has corroded the hydrant adapters, piping, pumps, motors, and caused damage to the electrical components that support the hydrant system.  Obsolescence, coupled with extensive deterioration of piping, pumps, and control systems, makes any repair alternative infeasible.  <br>     <br>  Work will include construct a pressurized hydrant fuel system with 16 hydrant outlets.  Modify a pumphouse to provide 151 liter-per-second (2,400 gallon-per-minute) pumping capacity fuel filter separators, upgraded electrical system and automatic controls, and emergency generator.  Construct hydrant loop piping system with leak detection, cathodic protection, and pigging system.  Work includes site preparation and improvements, pavement, drainage control, supporting utilities, and physical security measures.  Demolish or decommission the existing hydrant system outlets, lateral control pits, piping and supporting infrastructure.  Project includes remediation of fuel contaminated soils.  <br>
