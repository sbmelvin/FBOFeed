<SUBJECT>A -- Research and Development of Change Detection System
<SOLNBR>M67854-05-R-9003
<RESPDATE>112904
<CONTACT>Beverly  Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone 703 784-0614, Fax 703 784-1379, Email beverly.j.williams@usmc.mil
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, is soliciting for research and development of counter-improvised explosive devices (IED) system.  The requirement for the system includes delivery of one complete change detection system with three-dimensional volumetric capability of detecting potential improvised explosive devices; demonstration and validation of the technical capability; demonstration and validation of the operational capability; technical and engineering support for delivery and test; and logistics and maintenance support.  Award will be made on a best value basis with technical and past performance, when combined, being considerably more important than cost or price.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price level of efforts contract as a result of this request for proposal.  The period of performance will be through 30 September 2006.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  SPECIFIC TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.  Build and deliver one complete integrated change detection system with properly finished and tested mechanical interfaces, mountings, and power and communications links within 120 days after notice of contract award.  The system must be capable of detecting potential IEDs and must consist of: an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of autonomous flight operations with immediate manual override; an integrated stabilized platform capable of securely mounting the change detection system; three-dimensional volumetric change detection payload with 14.4 mega pixel digital camera; fixed video camera; digital media storage with at least four gigabites; global positioning system unit; photography computer with fire wire capable of interfacing with change interface with change detection system digital camera; and consolidated Ground Control and Processing Station.  Demonstrate and Validate the Change Detection Technical Capability.  Test must be conducted at or during test venue as coordinated between MCWL and the Marine Expeditionary Forces.  The test plan will be developed by MCWL.  Demonstrate and Test Critical Operational Issue #1:  The change detection system must produce actionable intelligence in an operationally meaningful timeframe, to include the ability to: provide information suitable for an operational command to identify the most appropriate IED counter-measure mix for a given IED threat; make go-no-go decisions with respect to route selection and/or tactical deployment of human and material assets; make informed decisions with respect to deployment of Explosive Ordnance Detachment (EOD) personnel and assets; determine the nature, volume, and geo-location of IED threats along a specified route or in a specified area in an accurate and timely manner; and accurately (e.g. within 10 meters) geo-locate potential IEDs with a low probability of false alarm.  Demonstrate and Test Critical Operational Issue #2:  The system must demonstrate a false alarm rate low enough to be operationally acceptable.  The false alarm rate must be below that which could impact mission accomplishment (e.g., mission delay or cancellation, false assignment of low-density, high-demand assets (e.g., EOD teams)).  Demonstrate and Test Critical Operational Issue #3: With regard to training, the change detection system must be easy to operate, maintain, and repair by standard Marine operational resources in theater. Provide the necessary program management and system integration for a comprehensive United States Marine Corps evaluation of the change detection system at the agreed-to test venue.  Provide the necessary direct onsite technical and operational support for the agreed-to test venue.  This effort includes moving all the physical assets to the test venue, establishing a System Operating and Support Base, and executing the test plan as developed by MCWL.  Provide the necessary logistics and maintenance support for the IED system. Provide a detailed technical analysis and report upon completion of the test event.  The report shall include ground truth data collected during the evaluation, as well as, an assessment of system performance and operational reliability.  A System Operator’s Manual shall be prepared, as well as, any required Technical Manuals.  Offers submitted on a basis other than F.O.B. Destination may be considered non-responsive.  No bidders list will be maintained by this office.  Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies and procedures contained in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The following options are optional tasks, which may be exercised within the period of performance.  OPTION 1:  The contractor shall integrate a Digital Data Link (DDL) into the system to further reduce the “time-to-actionable-information” interval. The DDL shall include a Short Stack Video Transmitter in the aircraft and a ground-based data processing capability that should be able to handle up to 45 mbps.  The proposed DDL should be entirely integrated with the UAV airframe, and should provide the capability to transmit the captured and meta-tagged images directly from the UAV out to a range of 50 kilometers.  
OPTION 2.  The contractor shall build and deliver a second complete change detection system to form a 3-D Volumetric Change Detection Unit (a ground station with two (2) UAVs) for deployment in support of OIF operational forces.  The contractor shall provide six months of “in country System Operations and Support” during which time Marines will be trained on the change detection payload.  This team will provide support seven (7) days per week for 10 to 12 hours per day.  Inspection and acceptance will be at destination.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound (FISCPS) intends to procure System Staging Materials in support of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) on a sole source basis from Berg Equipment and Scaffolding Co, 21340 East D Street, Tacoma, WA 98421, the only known authorized distributor for the Bil-Jax/Plettac Perfect System product in this area.  This procurement is sole source based on the requirement for the materials to be used with the extensive current inventory of Bil-Jax/Plettac Perfect System scaffolding equipment.  Introduction of an alternate scaffold product would render existing system scaffolding incompatible.  Due to the unique nature of each manufacturer’s System scaffolding, intermixing different manufacturer’s System products poses a serious safety hazard.  Given this fact, the American National Safety Institute (ANSI) prohibits the intermixing of scaffolding products. ANSI A10.8-1988, Scaffolding Safety Requirements, Section 9 states the following:  “9.15 System-scaffold components manufactured by different companies shall not be intermixed”.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity supply type contract.  It may include the ability to either purchase or rent the staging materials.  The period of performance for the Base Year is date of award through 1-year thereafter.  Up to four 1-year option periods may be included.  FOB Destination at PSNS Bremerton WA.  This procurement will be conducted using FAR Parts 12 and 13.5, Acquisition of Commercial Items and Simplified Acquisition Procedures, respectively.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about 31 August 04. To be negotiated on a sole source basis with Berg Equipment and Scaffolding Co per FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, which will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests may be submitted via fax to (360) 476-5083 or email: dan.briest@navy.mil.

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SEPARATE RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

Design or Engineering Services are required for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Value Engineering, Cost Estimating, Quality/Constructability Review and Customer Survey Services.  Task Order work will be used at any Base worldwide, but will focus on work in the United States, Caribbean and Europe.  The majority of services are expected to be in the area of Value Engineering.  Value Engineering services shall include Value Engineering Team Studies and SAVE Certified Value Engineering Training Workshops.

Professional reports, including graphics, computerized databases, and reports (VEDIS and VERT files).  Electronic submissions are required.  Reporting shall also include, but not be limited to:  computerized Value Engineering Database Information System files (VEDIS and FACD Reports (VERT).  The Navy may provide additional/alternate project specific information, study types, proposed team makeup, alternate siting of study, etc.  These may include providing Certified Value Specialist (CVS) facilitator(s) and experts for "Sustainable Design" workshops, Function Analysis Concept Development (FACD) workshops, design charettes, Value Engineering Studies, Choosing by Advantages Workshops, etc.

Cost Estimating Services may also be required and shall include development of construction project programming documents such as DD Forms 1391 (in traditional format and NAVFAC Design/Build Project Program format), Parametric Cost Estimates (PCEs), computerized parametric cost models, preliminary and detailed estimates.  Work may include economic, life cycle and risk analyses, and other cost engineering support services associated with facility construction and environmental cleanup.  Cost estimating services may also include development of parametric Navy models and Navy Unit Price Book (UPB) entries for the Tri-Services Automated Cost Engineering System (TRACES).  Quality Reviews (QRs) and Constructability Reviews (CRs) shall consist of a team study by a multi-disciplined team of professionals.  For QRs, the team will concentrate on coordination aspects of the design documents rather than technical aspects of the design.  For CRs, the team will concentrate on the appropriateness of the design documents, based on the proposed materials, project location and current standard construction practices.

Facility Quality Surveys.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command has developed a statistically based survey of completed facilities used to determine the level of client satisfaction and as a post occupancy tool.  A professional service to be provided by this contract will be arranging, conducting and documenting client impressions of recently occupied facilities.  The surveys have several objectives:  to let us understand the key issues impacting our customer base and their level of satisfaction with the products we produce – the surveyor is an unbiased, third party soliciting educated opinions of their level of satisfaction in a standardized manner; to let us understand areas of needed improvements to process or criteria – this will require the surveyor to understand DOD criteria, its initiatives and the processes by which we plan, design, construct and manage; to let us understand where we need improvement in the manner by which we traditionally manage and deliver the product; and to define operational deficiencies generally characterized as design, construction or warranty related issues.  Individual(s) conducting the survey must be a registered architect or engineer with a minimum 5 years experience.  Local staff is desirable to minimize cost of surveys.  All survey data is recorded in electronic format.

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to E-mail via the Internet for routine exchange of correspondence.  Telephone and email accessibility on a daily basis is required.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluations factors for all services.  Evaluation Factors (1) through (6) are of equal importance; factors (7) and (8) are of lesser importance and will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:

1.  Specialized Experience:
(a) Recent experience (last 5 years) in performing Value Engineering, focused primarily on FACD or charette based concepts, Cost Estimating, Quality/Constructability Review and Customer Survey (or Post Occupancy Evaluation) Services for construction/facility type projects.
(b) Recent experience (last 5 years) in the application of Value Engineering to sustainable design principles.
(c) Knowledge of local codes, laws, regulations, permitting requirements, construction materials, construction costs and practices within the area of responsibility (AOR) of NAVFAC ATLANTIC (United States, Caribbean and Europe).

2.  Professional qualifications of the proposed team leaders and other team members including education, experience, professional registration, LEED certification, and the ability to provide qualified staffing to support at least 3 simultaneous workshops/studies/reviews.  FACDs, design charettes, facilitation, and Value Engineering Studies and Reports shall be led by SAVE Certified Value Specialists (CVS).

3.  Sustainable Design:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure projects using the LEED Green Building Rating System to identify credits and LEED level achievable for the project through an integrated team approach.

4.  Organizational ability to assemble teams and begin work promptly and not to exceed 30 days advance notice; ability to generate and distribute draft reports during the Value Engineering or Quality/Constructability Review study period and conduct resolution meetings as part of these efforts; ability to perform work to aggressive schedules and changing requirements, and availability of staff to support swift and accurate project submittals.

5.  Past Performance:  With respect to Value Engineering efforts, past performance should include total life cycle cost reduction and corresponding improved quality, issue resolution, sustainable design, and facility occupant and Commanding Officer satisfaction; and timeliness of past performance - ability to provide required project submissions on schedule, including providing draft reports during workshops and studies as well as routine submissions after workshops and studies are complete.  Experience with each NAVFAC Facility Engineering Command is preferable.

6.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technically accurate products – show process and list key personnel responsible.

7.  Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).

8.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with two (2) additional one year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $2,000,000 for the entire contract term.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial Task Order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Estimated start date is March 2005.  This proposed contract is being solicited as 100% set aside for small businesses; therefore, replies to this notice are requested from all small business concerns.  The small business size standard classification is NAICS 541330 ($4,000,000).

<DESC>Description:  Notice of Intent to procure services on a sole source basis as a bridge effort to continue coordinating, executing and managing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) National Exercise Program (NEP) Top Official Exercise Series.  The bridge effort is for approximately five (5) month period beginning 30 January 2005 and continuing 31 July 2005 and is bridging the work currently cover under N65236-04-D-7601 until the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) contract is awarded (N65236-04-R-0089) which solicitation is expected to close 30 December 2004. Specifically, this contract will complete the remaining activities identified under the NEP TOPOFF 3 (T3) schedule.  This sole source action will be to Applied Marine Technology Incorporated (AMTI) of Virginia Beach VA who is currently providing the support efforts for T3 under contract N65236-04-D-7601.  AMTI has executed critical activities that include large scale table top exercises, command post exercise, full scale exercise initial planning conferences, and advanced distant learning exercises.   Additionally, a tremendous amount of coordination has been exhausted supporting T3 venue states (New Jersey and Connecticut), Canada and United Kingdom participation. The remaining T3 exercise activities predicate the utilization of the current AMTI team.  With the remaining activities in the NEP Schedule culminating in the T3 full scale exercise (FSE) in April 2005, there is not sufficient time to solicit a competitive contract.  AMTI has the proven resources, engineering expertise and subject matter experts in place that have been supporting T3 activities.  The remaining activities that must be accomplished include a large scale game, national level seminar, direction and control seminar, top officials seminar, the full scale exercise, after action report conference and the lessons learned report. The requested support services under this contract must continue to study, train and exercise, execute, evaluate and disseminate information to promote and improve tactical joint operations requiring extensive interoperability supported by advanced communications and information technology not previously exercised in the joint fashion required by new threats against the US homeland.  The training and testing of essential capabilities has a significant impact on the preparedness and readiness of the United States Government and its coordination with international governments to effectively counter the threat of terrorism or a terrorist attack. The work under this bridge effort is estimated to be $20 million dollars. NAICS code 541330 and FSC Code J058 applies. NOTE 22 also applies.  Inquires may be directed to Ms. Paula Somers at (843) 218-5976 or by facsimile to (843) 218-5807 or by email paula.somers@navy.mil.

<DESC>This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 611430 and the SIC Code is R799.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Commercial Services,  Fixed-Price contract for providing Leadership Training and Development Programs.   The period of performance will be for a one-year base period and four option years.  The full scope of work anticipated will be set forth in the statement of work (SOW) of the solicitation document that will be posted no later than Friday, December 17, 2004.  Offerors are advised that hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available as the entire document will be posted on FedBizOpps.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licenses and inspects nuclear reactors, materials, and waste facilities to ensure compliance with applicable codes and standards during all phases of construction, testing, and decommissioning operations to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the effects of radiation.  To further its mission, the Commission conducts training programs for its managers, supervisors, and other staff that are designed to strengthen the participants’ effectiveness and efficiency in their current positions and to develop their skills and knowledge for future work activities.   For over 25 years, the NRC has conducted a variety of in-house supervisory, managerial, technical, and professional development programs. Since 2001, NRC has conducted three,12-month Leadership Development Programs (LPP) to train individuals (Grades 13 - 15) for supervisory positions and two,18-month Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Programs (SESCDPs), with an SESCDP for 31 individuals currently being implemented. Approximately 65 individuals have completed the LPP and 50 have completed the SESCDPs. These programs are functioning effectively and major changes to them are not anticipated.  The services called for under this contract will be offered at NRC Headquarters and its four regional offices, except for those pertaining to the SESCDP and LPP, which are normally conducted in Headquarters.  In 2004, the NRC completed a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) to review the content of the most frequently instructed in-house, NRC courses offered to Grades 7 - SES. The contractor may be requested to revise, as needed, and instruct, the following courses that were reviewed in the TNA: Coaching and Counseling Skills for Managers (2 days), Conducting and Participating in Meetings, (2 days), Effective Communication for NRC Inspectors (3 days), Effective Oral Presentations (3 days), Facilitation Techniques Workshop (2 days), Gathering Inspection Information Through Interviews (2 days), Human Resources Management Practices (2 days), Interviewing Skills and Techniques for Recruiters (1 day), Leading NRC Work Teams (2 days), Managing Change (2 days), Media Training (2 days), Negotiating Techniques: How to Gain Agreement (2 days),  Management Workshop--Exploring Emotional Intelligence (2 days), Performance Appraisal (1 day), Public Outreach Meetings (2 days), Selection Interviewing Workshop (2 days), Situational Leadership (1 day), Small Group Dynamics (2 - 3 days), Supervising Human Resources (5 days), and Technical Writing for Supervisors and their Staff (1 day).  The TNA reviewed the Participant Handbook for each course (the courses did not have Instructor Guides) to identify the following elements: learning objectives, course content for each learning objective, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Leadership Competencies covered in each course, the relationship of content to level of learning as identified in Bloom’s Taxonomy, sequencing and content flow, and instructional methods.  The TNA, which will be available to the contractor upon award, includes an analysis of the findings for each of the above elements.  In Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004, 32 separate technical and leadership courses were offered in-house, with each course presented two to eight times during each fiscal year.  Twenty-three out of the 32 courses offered were leadership courses.  We anticipate this level of effort to continue over the next five years.  Contracting services are needed to instruct the 23 leadership courses, as well as, the other activities described in the SOW.   This is not a request for proposal and responses to this notice are not required at this time.  Questions concerning this announcement should be addressed via e-mail to cac3@nrc.gov.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: E-Government Implementation Plan and Taxation Pilot in Uzbekistan.

NOTE: THIS IS A RE-ANNOUNCEMENT.  THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED BIDS FOR THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAVE THE OPTION TO SUBMIT A NEW PROPOSAL OR SUBMIT A PREVIOUS ONE.

The Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan (UzACI) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on an e-government implementation plan and taxation pilot in Uzbekistan.  In addition to evaluating current e-government strategies and policies and benchmarking them against other countries, the technical assistance will include organizing a government-wide workshop to discuss the current infrastructure and future options for e-government; developing a conceptual design and defining technical requirements for a target e-government enterprise architecture; conducting an environmental assessment; and elaborating a strategic e-government implementation plan.  The technical assistance will also cover the development and implementation of an e-taxation pilot program in Syrdarya, a small city near Tashkent.

Over the past few years, development of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Uzbekistan has become a major priority for the Government of Uzbekistan and one of the primary factors for the country’s economic growth.  A 2002 Presidential Decree called for the widespread introduction of IT technologies, including the creation of e-government, throughout the country.  Uzbekistan developed a National ICT Strategy as a result.  The ICT Strategy addresses many issues, such as increased efficiency in government management operations through electronic technologies, establishing an environment for free access to information, and enhancing intergovernmental communications.  However, it remains more of a vision statement than a concrete, sequential implementation plan.  Efforts have not been coordinated among government ministries and agencies, and most of the systems that have already been implemented are incompatible with one another.  The Government of Uzbekistan has not been keeping centralized statistics on the current state of ICT penetration, and critical legislation needed for e-government implementation has not yet been adopted.

With these needs in mind, the Government of Uzbekistan now recognizes that it is necessary to establishing a comprehensive e-government strategy and implementation plan separate from overall ICT development.  The Cabinet of Ministers and UzACI have requested assistance in developing an implementation plan that would define the Government of Uzbekistan’s current IT and organizational environment, and provide a sequencing plan for transitioning from the current to the targeted IT architecture, including coordination of government efforts; enhancement of networks and information systems; and development of new applications.  Such a plan must also realistically assess existing human resources capabilities and outline training needs.  In 2003, USTDA sponsored a Defintional Mission that recommended technical assistance to address these issues.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $502,600 grant to UzACI from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or Uzbekistan.   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to UzACI c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. January 21, 2005, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  UzACI reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  UzACI also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  UzACI is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Based on the complexity and importance of this project the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to the contractor offering the best value to the Government.  Therefore for this procurement, the technical evaluation factors when combined will be significantly more important than price.

This Advisory multi-step process will be solicited in two steps.  Issuance of this pre solicitation notice is the first step.  The second step will be the issuance of a Request for Proposals (RFP).  This initial step invites potential offerors to submit specific information as described below.

SUBMISSION DESCRIPTION/REQUIREMENTS

Pre solicitation Step

In the pre solicitation step, potential offerors will be invited to submit information which conforms to the following technical evaluation factors:

Factor No. 1		Experience on Similar Projects			300 points
Factor No. 2		Past Performance on Similar Projects		250 points
Factor No. 3		Qualifications of Key Personnel	                          150 points
Total possible points under pre solicitation submission:			700 points

Each submission will be reviewed in accordance with the minimum requirements listed for each factor.  After review of each submission, each potential offeror will be advised, in writing, by GSA either that it is invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) step of this procurement, or based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Notwithstanding the advice given by GSA, all potential offerors responding to step one will be advised that they may participate in the next step of this procurement process.  FIRMS THAT DO NOT SUBMIT WRITTEN RESPONSES TO THIS PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN SUBSEQUENT STEPS OF THIS PROCUREMENT.

RFP Step

The second step of this procurement will be the issuance of a Request for Proposal package to all potential offerors found to be viable competitors under the initial step of the procurement.  Should a potential offeror who was found to be a nonviable competitor request a copy of the RFP package, the Government will provide it.  Upon issuance of the RFP, potential offerors will be required to provide a notarized statement from a Treasury approved surety  stating that the offeror has bonding capacity equal to or greater than the estimated construction cost range of this project.  Offerors will also be required to provide evidence that they are licensed as a  general contractor in the State of New York.

The RFP will require the submission of two separate packages to be submitted simultaneously.  The first package will be a Technical Proposal and will include the offeror's response to the following technical evaluation factors:

Factor No. 4	  Project Management Plan                      				250 points
Factor No. 5	  Small Disadvantaged Business Participation                                  50 points
Total possible points under RFP submission:					300 points

The second package will be a Price Proposal.   The Technical Proposals will be opened first and evaluated by the Government.  Once the technical evaluation is completed, (the evaluation will include the Technical Evaluation Factors issued under both the Pre-Solicitation Notice and the RFP) the Price Proposals will be opened.  The Price Proposals shall be segregated from the Technical Proposals and placed in a separate envelope.  

The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, but if a decision is made to conduct discussions with offerors, the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range. (see FAR 15.306).

Each offeror's technical evaluation results from the pre solicitation step of this procurement will be carried forward into the RFP step of this procurement which will result in an offeror receiving a possible total point score of 1,000 (700 points from the pre solicitation step and 400 from the RFP step)

STEP ONE PRE SOLICITATION SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Firms responding to this pre soliciation notice will be required to submit six (6) copies of the requested information.  The information shall be submitted in an 8 1/2" x 11" bound format and should be organized to scorrespond with the technical evaluation factors listed below.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561499   THIS AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE SYNOPSIS IS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a non-commerical sole source purchase order with American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR), 17000 Commerce Parkway, Suite C, Mt. Laurel, NJ for management of the AAAR PM Supersites Program and Related Studies International Specialty Conference in Atlanta GA, February 7 - 11, 2005.  This management includes all logistics support and management of finances, as specified in  the AAAR-AH (Association Headquarters) Management Agreement.  AAAR is a nonprofit organization widely renown in the scientific community for aerosol-based research.  AAAR is the sponsoring entity of this conference, and manages logistics of it's sponsored conferences through the AAAR-AH management  agreement.  EPA in effect has elected to financially cosponsor this particular conference with AAAR, due to its benefit to environmental research, and therefore must abide by the AAAR-AH agreement already in place.  Therefore, EPA believes that AAAR is the only source capable of providing the  required services for this AAAR conference.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The period of performance is expected to be from January  2005 through December 2005  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and,  therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Submit your response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement  Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Rebecca Clausen, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.

<SOLNBR>05SP308041
<RESPDATE>011305
<ARCHDATE>12152005
<CONTACT>Rita Guilbert Manager, Acq & Asst Group 7022938161     RGuilbert@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) manages all of the operations, engineering, maintenance, and public visitor services activities directly related to Hoover Dam.  Hoover Dam is located on the Colorado River 30 miles south east of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Reclamation intends to issue a 'Concessions Prospectus'  for an individual or company to provide management services for the visitor services portion of the Hoover Dam activities. Hoover Dam is perhaps the most historically significant dam within the United States.  Hoover Dam sits across the Colorado River (Nevada/Arizona boundary) and forms Lake Mead.  The Dam which was built during the depression and completed in 1935 provides downstream flood protection, water for agriculture and human consumption, and power generation.  A major highway presently crosses the dam providing the main route between Southern Nevada (Las Vegas) and Northern Arizona. Over 1,000,000 people per year pay to tour  Hoover Dam, an equal number just stop and look around the top of the dam.  Reclamation operates a large tour/visitor services center and provides a multi-story parking structure on the Nevada side of the dam.  A parking fee is charged.  Reclamation provides exhibits related to the construction of the dam and conducts tours inside the plant as well as giving interpretive talks on top the dam.  There are retail outlets, run by the State of Nevada under the authority of the Randolph Shepard Act (blind vendors), providing souvenirs and food and beverage to the public.  Reclamation has two contracts, not concessions, with companies to provide ticket sales for dam tours, parking management and some associated retail sales.  Reclamation has recently developed  National Concessions Management Policies and Guidelines, and Hoover Dam intends to transition most of the existing contracts, visitor services management and support to a single concessionaire.  The scope of work would include ticket reservations and sales, marketing, parking management, development and merchandising of souvenirs  and  interpretation services, visitor security, facility general maintenance, and retail operations. The overall management and administration would be expected to assure that all operations run efficiently and provide good value and service to the public, by one company.  No subcontracts will be allowed. Visitor services are conducted everyday, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas, with spring and summer receiving the most visitation.  Tours conducted in the interior portions of the dam will continue to be conducted by federal Reclamation staff.  There may be an increased opportunity for interpretative services in several languages, and concessions on top of the dam. In Fiscal Year 2004 the above activities generated approximately $11.6 million in sales.  The initial opportunities will not require significant investment as all the facilities are government owned and fully functional.  The concessionaire would be expected to enhance the historic Hoover Dam experience while maintaining the dignity of the area.   Reclamation is in the process of investing more than 1.5 million dollars to refurbish and upgrade exhibits in the visitor center.  There is also an existing site plan to expand the visitor experience and still maintain a high level of security.  The timing for implementing the new plan is tied closely to completing the new bridge across the Colorado River just below Hoover Dam.  The new bridge will remove the traffic from Hoover Dam and allow the visiting public to enjoy the dam without the disruption of passing cars and trucks.  The bridge is scheduled to open in the first months of 2008.  Studies show the dam will not decrease visitation to Hoover Dam, and it may provide the opportunity to explore new options on top of the dam.  The highway relocation and bridge may allow Hoover Dam to develop public orientation and staging facilities in the future offsite. The concession contract will be for a base period of 3 years  with the opportunity of up to  5 one- year extensions (total of from 3 to 8 years).   The extensions will be dependent  upon concessionaire's performance and Reclamation's needs upon completion of the bridge project.  The PROSPECTUS will identify all criteria for operations. Reclamation intends to issue the subject PROSPECTUS and in the Spring of 2005 with the intent of implementing the new concessions contract sometime between October 1, 2005, and March 1, 2006.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the Prospectus are invited to submit a response to this request.  Responses should clearly state the firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address.  The firm's knowledge, skills, and experience that would qualify them for this work should be stated in the form of a resume and/or curriculum vitae.  Information received through this notice may be used by the Government, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No claim to the Government will be considered for the use of any information submitted.  Interested parties responding to this notice shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the information.  The information collected is considered market research and will not be returned. Responses should be provided to Rita Guilbert at rguilbert@lc.usbr.gov or fax at 702-293-8499 no later than Thursday, January 13, 2005.

<DESC>Title:  Uncooled and Cooled Imaging 
 
Sources sought for equipment to be used as part of an Imaging Infrared Reconnaissance and Surveillance Kit.  The equipment includes government or non-developmental commercially available IR imaging cameras, lens systems, displays, power supplies, cables and computer data interfaces.  

Background:  Department of Defense (DoD) Forces need to have the capability to observe a target area from long distances and under lower lighting than the present equipment provides for, under both day and night conditions.  They must be able to collect, store and transmit imagery at Near Real Time (NRT) in order to respond to the commander’s Primary Intelligence Requirement (PIR) for mission support.  The equipment must be small, lightweight, and reliable.  
Problem:  The present system does not have the desired night detection, recognition and identification (discrimination) range and low light capability.  SOF would like to determine if infrared hardware exists that will augment or increase the night discrimination performance.
The Government is seeking a COTS/GOTS small lightweight cooled or uncooled manually operated IR camera as a solution to this problem.  The camera system will be carried in a waterproof and shock resistant transit case (bag or housing) that is not part of this solicitation.  The Government or its system integrator can provide integration support such as cables, threaded adapters, or brackets to connect the system to the existing digital recorder or camcorder. 
Requirements: 
1)  Thresholds (T). The hardware only solution must satisfy the following requirements.  The failure to meet any of the thresholds will be cause for rejection.  
1.1) The camera system must be a GOTS/COTS non-developmental item is a threshold requirement (T).  Integration or machining of adapters is permissible and support is available from the systems integrator.
1.2) The camera system must be available for user assessment within one week from the end of this solicitation (T).
1.3) The camera system shall be adaptable to or use an existing 6-inch Newtonian reflective lens.  The manufacturer must be able to design and provide one prototype optical assembly within six month ARO that has the ability to correct the image of the 6 inch parabolic reflector and provide near diffraction limited resolution performance for an effective F-number of 1.2 or less (T).  
1.4) The camera supplier shall provide one standard manual focus lens per thermal camera with a focal length between 25mm and 75mm with F-numbers between 1.0 and 2.0 (T) or one additional secondary manual focus lens with a focal length between 100mm and 200mm with F-numbers between 1.5 and 2.5 (T).
1.5) Two-camera system are required.  One must collect target energy in the Midwave Infrared, MWIR, (3 microns to 5 microns) and the other must collect target energy in the Longwave Infrared, LWIR, (8 to 12 microns) spectral bands (T).  Different suppliers may be selected for the two cameras
1.6) The Camera weight (without optics and cables) must not be more than 8 pounds (T).1.7) No special tools shall be required to assemble or operate the camera or the lens (T).1.8) The camera must be operable via battery power (~12 VDC) and wall plug power adapter (~110 VAC, 60 Hz or ~220 VAC, 50 Hz) (T).1.9) The camera and lens combination must be designed for hand held operation or mounting on a tripod via a 1/4-20 thread (T).
 
2)  Objectives (O).  The solution should satisfy the following objective requirements.   
2.1 The camera characteristics of the MWIR or LWIR, cooled or uncooled camera should provide under ideal scenario and environmental conditions a 50% probability of detection for a person or probability of resolving two stationary people standing one-person width apart at a range of 5 Km when used with the existing 6 inch Newtonian reflector lens system (O).
2.2) Fixed or zoom optical systems with a maximum focal length and F-numbers consistent with the performance, size and weight objectives.
2.3) The camera weight (without optics) should be 5 pounds or less (O).
2.4) Adaptable to or use existing 6 inch Newtonian reflective lens.
2.5) The camera and lens should be easily assembled and fully operational in less than 5 minutes (O)
2.7) The diameter of camera system should not be more than 150mm (6 inches) (O).
2.8) The lens and camera system when assembled should not be more than 300 mm (12 inches long) (O).2.8) Upon set up, the camera will automatically go to default settings of every required function as predetermined by offerer (O). These settings may then be changed by user if desired (O). 2.9) Any required calibrations of the cameras will be performed automatically at offerer’s pre-determined time intervals (O). This calibration may be suspended by user if desired (O).
 
Existing Hardware Characteristics:
The present system uses the Stanford Photonics ICCD model XR4/M-OP and a Fujinon CCTV a 1" format, F2.8 - F18, 34-750mm zoom lens with c-mount that weighs less than 4.2 lbs.
 
Initial Evaluation:  The offerer must provide written information (15 pages or less including all tables and photos) in Microsoft Word format that describes the product and its capabilities as they compare to the requirements listed above. In addition to the above information, offerer will present his estimate of performance evaluation for the proposed hardware based on estimates of the Probability of Detection of personnel as a function of range or probability of resolving two people standing one person width apart at a range of 5 Km when used with the (1) Existing 6 inch Newtonian  Reflector, (2) Standard Lens, (3) Secondary Lens.  This estimate shall use the method described in “New metric for predicting target acquisition performance” Optical Engineering Vol. 43 No. 11, November 2004 pages 2806 – 2818.  Richard H. Vollmerhausen, Eddie Jacobs, and Ronald G.

<DESC>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Joint Warfighting Space Office at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to design and build a high quality imaging spectrometer system. The total program budget for the design and build effort is approximately $10 to $15M over 30 months. There will be a separately priced contract option for a complete data package on the design, manufacturing, support, and operation of the sensor payload.  

B. The objective of the Advanced Responsive Tactically Effective Military Imaging Spectrometer (ARTEMIS) project is to develop a hyperspectral sensor suitable for integration on a government provided spacecraft bus and interface to government furnished data storage and processing system as part of a rapid development experiment.  The objective of this effort is to achieve a sensor payload.  The sensor design includes an imaging spectrometer capable of covering the visible through short-wave infrared spectral range, and a high resolution panchromatic imager.  The total hyperspectral sensor cost includes the telescope; optics; the spectrometer including the Focal Plane Array; the control and read out electronics; pre-delivery characterization; documentation; integration support at a government facility and support during early in-flight calibration verification.    The completed design must include a plan for delivery of the flight hardware sensor subsystem with complete calibration within 15 months after contract award.  The proposal should include a contract option that may be exercised at any time during the contract period of performance, to provide a complete data package on the design, manufacturing, support, and operation of the sensor payload and/or spacecraft that will allow the government to procure additional sensors in a competitive selection process.  The data package includes but is not limited to: mechanical drawings, optical layout/drawings, electrical specifications and data flow specifications, electrical/mechanical/thermal interface drawings and specifications, test/verification procedures, common/unique support equipment, long lead/critical spares lists, software documentation, interface requirements for payload and/or spacecraft, and storage/handling procedures.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.
A.  INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that reduce mobility response times, reduce deployable support structures, increase deployed combat capability and effectiveness, and/or enable USAF members to do their job more efficiently.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 05, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 
B.  OBJECTIVE:  Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs.  AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander of the Air Mobility Warfare Center, the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander U.S. Transportation Command, and the Chief of Staff of the USAF. 

Within the fields of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support, current high-interest areas include:
 
·	Aeromedical evacuation enhancements
·	Air base opening capabilities
·	Aircraft threat mitigation
·	Autonomous landing capabilities
·	Enhancing aircrew situational awareness
·	Collaborative tools to facilitate C2 reach back capabilities
·	Expeditionary airbase/en route force protection
·	MAF/CAF interoperability, specifically organizational and process interoperability
·	NVG-compliant airfield lighting and NVG training
·	Precision airdrop and airdrop tracking
·	Real time in transit visibility 
·	Seamless and secure communication between MAF/CAF aircraft, C2 centers, and ground forces
·	Tactically-relevant aircrew training devices

AMB solicits white papers with the potential to enhance Air Force operations within any element of air mobility operations or their interfaces with the rest of the Defense Transportation System.  Submitters are encouraged to visit http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm to view a current list of AMB innovation areas.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and 13. Solicitation No. N68711-04-R-3613, REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL SERVICES AT VARIOUS NAVAL FACILITIES LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be a single award Firm-Fixed Price and Indefinite Quantity contract. The performance period will include a base year and four 12-month option periods. This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562111 and the size standard is $10.5 million dollars. The solicitation documents, incorporated provisions, and clauses are those in effect through FAR Circular 01-24. This solicitation incorporates FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212.3, 52.212.4, and 52.212-5, and are attached to the solicitation. PURSUANT TO SECTION 6001 OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 1976 (RCRA), 42 USC 6961, AND SECTION 66.0108, ARTICLE 6, OF THE SAN DIEGO MUNICIPAL CODE, OFFERORS MUST POSSESS (AT TIME OF AWARD) A VALID, UNREVOKED, AND UNEXPIRED CITY-GRANTED, NON-EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE SOLICITED CONTRACT. PROOF OF SAID FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO AWARD OF THE SUBJECT CONTRACT. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: Factor #1 Key Personnel, Vehicles & Equipment, and Reporting. Key Personnel: Provide a resume of Project Manager and Quality Control Manager to be assigned to the contract. Vehicles & Equipment: Describe in sufficient detail, vehicles and equipment to meet the work requirements identified in the performance work statement (e.g., leased or owned, how many, age, and status). Explain how offeror will maintain equipment and containers in a clean, sanitary condition, and minimize odors. Reporting: Provide the process the offeror will use to ensure refuse and recyclable materials will be segregated, weighed and documented in accordance with the performance work statement. Factor #2 Past Performance Provide a list of up to 10 contracts similar in size and complexity to the solicited contract that were completed during the past 3 years and a list of all such similar contracts currently in process. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Provide the information on Exhibit A for each contract. Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective. The evaluation of past performance will include the contractor’s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, record of conforming to applicable law and industry standards (i.e., Service Contract Act Wage Determinations); quality of workmanship, record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies; record of controlling costs; safety performance record, and adherence to schedules. The Government reserves the right to contact any other sources of information that may have knowledge or information on an offeror’s relevant past performance history. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to proposals of other offerors. Factor #3 Price The price proposal for the base and all option periods will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the offeror’s proposal. One or more of the following techniques will be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price: 1. Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 2. Comparison of proposed prices with the independent Government estimate. 3. Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information. 4. Comparison of proposed prices with resources proposed. A price that is found to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable. Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: Key Personnel, Vehicles & Equipment, and Reporting and Past Performance are equally important to each other and when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. THIS RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FREE OF CHARGE VIA THE INTERNET WORLD WIDE WEB AT http://esol.navfac.navy.mil ON OR AROUND SEPTEMBER 22, 2004 AND CAN BE FOUND UNDER SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NO. N68711-04-R-3613. No hard copies (paper sets) or CD-ROM of the RFP will be provided by the Government. Telephone and facsimile request will not be accepted. Notification of any changes (amendments) to the solicitation will be made only on the internet. It will be the contractor's responsibility to check the website daily for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Plan holders list will not be faxed and will be available only at the internet website address listed above.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-25

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for three(3) Spectroscopic Portal Monitors to be used by the NIST/Ionizing Radiation Division in developing a new ANSI Standard and its associated test and evaluation protocol for spectroscopic portal monitors for the Department of Homeland Security.  The Government anticipates making more than one (1) award against this solicitation.

NIST is developing a new ANSI standard and its associated Test and Evaluation Protocol for spectroscopic portal monitors for the Department of Homeland Security. To support this development it is necessary to test these devices.  

The main difference between monitors developed by different manufacturers is the distributions of detectors inside the portal monitor cabinets and the associated software. Due to this, it will be necessary to test systems produced by different manufacturers that can provide different geometries for the detectors and different software packages for data acquisition.  

NIST, together with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is planning to fully test these instruments against the draft ANSI N42.38 standards for spectroscopic portal monitors that is presently under development.  This standard specifies the operational and performance requirements for spectroscopy-based portal monitors used in Homeland Security applications.  

Spectroscopy-based portal monitors have the ability to detect radioactivity and identify radionuclides that may be present in or on persons, vehicles, or containers. Non-radionuclide identifying portal monitors are addressed by ANSI N42.35.  Operational requirements established by ANSI N42.38 include radiation detection and radionuclide identification, and those requirements associated with the expected electrical, mechanical, and environmental conditions when a monitor is placed in use.  The tests described in this standard provide a means to ensure that a monitor meets the requirements.  Successful completion of the tests described in this standard should not be construed as an ability to successfully detect and identify all radionuclides in all environments. This standard does not address portal monitors that may have the ability to reduce the effects of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) and reduce the nuisance alarm rate without the ability to identify individual radionuclides.

THE FOLLOWING GENERAL REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO LINE ITEMS 0001, 0002 & 0003:  (1) ALL THREE PORTAL MONITORS SHALL HAVE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE PACKAGES; (2) DELIVERY SHALL BE COMPLETED NOT LATER THAN 6 TO 8 WEEKS AFTER THE DATE OF AWARD; (3) ONE SYSTEM SHALL MONITOR PEDESTRIANS AND TWO SYSTEMS SHALL MONITOR VEHICLES; (4) ALL SYSTEMS SHALL HAVE NAI(TL) FOR GAMMA-RAY DETECTION AND HE-3 TUBES FOR NEUTRON DETECTION.

<DESC>WORK STATEMENT

“Definitional Mission” for Advisory and Assistance Services by Non-Governmental Sources for Morocco.”

Project Title:  Morocco: Water Resource and Wastewater Treatment Definitional  Mission

1		Scope of Work

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility studies or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative studies or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) as to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment. The designated COTR for this project is Leila Afas.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassies in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of each Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to various locations within Morocco to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy personnel.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

6.		 Project Descriptions and Profile

Morocco is an emerging market economy at the crossroads of Europe, Africa and the Middle East that imports $11 billion worth of goods each year.  Currently, U.S. exports comprise only one percent of Morocco’s imports, while European goods comprise more than fifty percent of the country’s imports.  Morocco has begun implementing an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), which provides preferential tariff treatment for most EU industrial exports to Morocco, putting the American companies at a disadvantage.  However, the recently signed United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will improve U.S. exporters’ goods and services competitiveness in this market.  Under the FTA, which goes into effect on January 1, 2005, U.S. exports will receive more favorable tariff treatment.  In fact, USTR indicates that the U.S.-Morocco FTA includes the best market access package of any U.S. FTA with a developing country. 

	Morocco is a semi-arid country where water resources are limited.  The country's congested urban centers and population growth have continued to contribute to the deterioration of the environment.  To meet the challenges of globalization and industrial competitiveness, Morocco continues to upgrade product standards.  Rapid urbanization of recent years continues to increase the problems of potable and agricultural water supply and wastewater treatment.   Morocco is much in need of education and models for recycling, conservation and efficiency to encourage the population to be more environmentally responsible.  Industrial controls, waste treatment and efficient equipment can actually decrease production costs while reducing environmental emissions.  As a developing country with a high birth rate, Morocco must decrease water residues in order to find alternative solutions to protect the environment and to improve quality of life.  

	With Morocco's long coastline, desalination research is a primary focus to increase potable and agricultural water supply.  Faced with the fact that 57% of the rural population does not have access to safe/clean drinking water, increasing the supply of safe drinking water to the countryside is also a priority for ONEP.  For the rural areas, the goal is to satisfy at least 80% of the rural population’s need by 2010, both for water distribution and sewage services.  Plans for increasing water supply capacity in Morocco to meet increased rural population and the agricultural sector demand offer a growing market to U.S. suppliers of water and wastewater equipment.

Morocco is looking for state-of-the-art water purification and wastewater treatment equipment for the current needs of the country.  ONEP produces about 80% of the potable water for the entire country.  The utilities companies, called "Regies," provide 12%; the private sector provides 6% and the Communes 2%.  The sewage services are actually provided by the "Regies" for large cities, except for Casablanca and Rabat, where concessions have been let to Lydec (France) and Redal (Portugal), respectively.  ONEP is now investing in the sewage sector and several communes have decided to sign a co-share management convention with ONEP for sewage services. 

From 2003 through 2006, the government plans an annual investment of about $250 million for potable water improvement.  This investment program aims at expanding the access to potable water in all cities by increasing the rate of connections to the existing network to reach 96% by 2010.  This plan will include a program to improve sewage in 24 large cities, 50 medium cities and 85 small centers.  It also envisages the creation of autonomous sewage systems in both urban and rural areas and will consist of collecting the urban effluents in the areas not connected to the existing sewage network.  Treatment plants and water purification equipment will be needed to process the urban effluents for cities located along the coast.  For sewage, the demand in investment is estimated at $6.5 billion by the year 2015. 

	The Moroccan Government is fully committed to the improvement of the country’s environment.  Since Regional Director Steingass’s visit to Morocco in February 2004, and the signing of the FTA in June, USTDA has received letters of interest from the Government of Morocco for assistance with a variety of environment projects in the potable and agricultural water supply and wastewater treatment sectors.
