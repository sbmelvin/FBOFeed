<DESC>Solicitation FA8053-13-R-0001 will be ISSUED ON OR ABOUT 18 March 2013. The Government's requirement is for a new personal service contract requirement consistent with DFARS 237.104(b)(ii)(A)(1) to fill temporary (less than 1 year) staffing gaps at 63 military treatment facilities (MTFs) with qualified clinical personnel (e.g., physicians and nurses) for the treatment of military health system (MHS) beneficiaries. While some of the required fills will be predictable and will have more than 30 days lead time, in some instances, required fills will be unpredictable and require rapid fill (the goal is within 30 days). Additionally, there may be instances where a quicker fill is needed and vendors may be asked to meet those requirements. The MTFs covered will include all Air Force CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam locations. The Government anticipates establishing multiple Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contracts to acquire the clinical direct patient care services.<br /><br />This action is set aside for Total Small Business in accordance with FAR 19.502-2, Total Small Business Set-Asides. The applicable North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 622110, with a small business size standard of $34.5M.
<p>This contracting office will issue no hard copies of the solicitation. All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments on or about 18 March 2013 from www.fbo.gov .<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 52.204-99, all offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/) in order to be eligible for award. Registration requires a DUNS number and may take up to three weeks to process. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award. Instructions for registering are available at the SAM website.</p>
<p>All inquiries should be made by email. Phone inquiries will not be accepted at this time.</p>

<RESPDATE>022613
<CONTACT>Ken Tilby, Contracting Officer, Phone 8015863465, Email kenneth.tilby@hill.af.mil - Melissa S Huston, Contract Negotiator, Phone 8017756535, Email melissa.huston@hill.af.mil
<DESC>OO-ALC/Market Research/Request for Information (RFI): AFLCMC/HBZKB is requesting information from interested sources about a potential requirement for Depot Logistics Support for the Command and Control Switching System (CCSS). The current contract was awarded on a sole-source basis to Raytheon Co. Raytheon is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the CCSS switches and most peripheral equipment. Raytheon has supported this requirement under three similar contracts for the past twenty five (25) years. The Government has limited rights to the CCSS data. <br /><br />CCSS is an advanced multilevel precedence digital telecommunication switching system developed for command and control, requiring highly reliable secure communications. These systems serve as the backbone for the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) and provide complete feature service to a community of users in a secure communication environment. CCSS is designed as a modular, expandable, high-isolation, redundant, non-blocking switch with emphasis on reliability and interface flexibility. The CCSS provides intra/intercommunication among subscriber lines, attendant consoles, trunks and data ports. It features extremely high crosstalk isolation, unlimited digital conference capability, and multilevel precedence and preemption call processing. CCSS switches interface with numerous cryptographic devices, as well as T1 bulk encryption equipment which permits circuit access to automated secure voice communications, Defense Switch Network (DSN), and commercial networks. Components on the CCSS system are state-of-the-art, non-developmental items.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This proposed acquisition will provide follow-on depot level lifecycle logistic support for CCSS switches. There are currently over 150 listed operational CCSS switches located at strategic worldwide locations. Critical users include: The White House Communications Agency, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as other DoD and Civilian Government agencies, and the Canadian government. Other users will be supported by the proposed contract as they join the DRSN.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will provide contractor logistics support (CLS), spare parts replenishment, repair of components, technical manuals, depot logistics support office (DLSO), field logistics support offices (FLSO), software support, engineering and technical assistance, system training, switch installations and relocations (includes de-installation and re-installation), and the capability to engineer, furnish, install and test (EFI&amp;T) future new CCSS equipment and configuration upgrades.</p>
<p>Your response to this RFI should describe your technical approach for providing depot logistics support to the CCSS. Your response should include a description of your past experience with the Raytheon line of switches used in the CCSS and identify any major cost, schedule, and risk drivers associated with your technical approach. The Air Force is in the sustainment phase of the CCSS lifecycle. Any cost information provided in response to this RFI will not be binding. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information requested except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs. It is anticipated all information received in response to this RFI will be unclassified. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as company private or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the Government. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the Government's review of their responses. Interested parties must respond in writing. Your response to this request must be submitted no later than Tuesday, 26 February 2013, addressed to the Contracting Officer, Ken Tilby via e-mail (Kenneth.Tilby@hill.af.mil). If you have questions, or require additional information, please contact Ken Tilby, Contracting Officer.</p>

The space must be available for occupancy on or before August 1, 2013.<br />USDA is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. USDA will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, USDA will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy USDA's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy USDA's requirements, as well as costs to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenants improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<p>TERM: The term of the lease will be 10 years.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: Space should be ready for occupancy within six (6) months of lease award.</p>
<p>OTHER: Submission by other than the owner of manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter for ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space. In instances where the offeror is representing more than one property, the offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of the owner.</p>
<p>1. Building name and address or site location and address<br />2. Location of space within building.<br />3. Rentable square feet offered and full service rental rate per-square-foot.<br />4. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and common area factor<br />5. Number of on-site, paved parking spaces<br />6. Contact information for Ownership or Authorized Agent.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to procure, on a Firm Fixed Price basis, an ultra-fast digital video camera manufactured by Shimadzu.

The Shimadzu ultra-fast digital camera, capable of one million fps with a minimum resolution of 300 pixels X 256 pixels, will be used at the Ordnance Test & Evaluation Division (OT&E) in Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA. This ultra high speed video camera will capture ultra high speed digital video for customers to perform engineering analysis and studies in warhead development in support of NAWCWD and its customers.
  This will allow NAWCWD and its customers to analyze warhead fragmentation and velocity of detonation among other things. OT&E requires an ultra-high speed camera that meets the above specifications and that is compatible with existing hardware and software. OT&E has an inventory of Photron cameras.

The Government intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with Sunair, 3131 SW 42nd Street, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33312, CAGE 12338, in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
  The basis for restricting competition is that Sunair is the original equipment manufacturer and is not willing to sell the data rights for the complex high frequency data capable radio assemblies.

The MTAOM is a vehicle/shelter based system that provides the interfaces to adjacent and higher command agencies.  This acquisition is under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 334290 - Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing.  
Solicitation will be issued for an anticipated FFP contract.  Delivery terms are 180 days after effective date of order with F.O.B: Destination, Inspection and Acceptance: Destination.

<CONTACT>Kimberly Loesch

<a href="mailto:Loesch.Kimberly@epa.gov">Loesch.kimberly@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The US EPA intends to procure on a sole source basis with Cedarville Engineering Group, LLC for the following services:  soil taxonomic, site characterization, soil hydrologic measures, and basic fertility chemical analysis on samples taken by the contractor in multiple urban sites.  The soils extracted for sampling will require identification to the lowest possible taxonomic level, using a range of soil taxonomic classifications.  This research will provide more specific data to be used in a report titled "Urban Soil Taxonomic Descriptions and Characterization of Soil Properties Applied to the Sustainable Use of Vacant Land" for the US EPA's Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory which is being prepared under a separate order awarded to Cedarville Engineering Group, LLC. The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability of handling all phases of urban soil site characterization, soil hydrologic measures, indentifying soils to a taxonomic resolution and quality that is consistent with samples collected in previous years and to carry out basic chemical/fertility (texture, organic matter, CEC, etc.) laboratory analysis.  This includes handling all administrative tasks (site selection-in collaboration with the US EPA, right of access, permissions) related to site work in urban core areas including, though not limited to Cleveland OH, Detroit MI, Omaha NE, Philadelphia PA, and the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii).  The necessity for this variety of sites across the country allows a cross section of soil types to be analyzed.  Cedarville Engineering Group, LLC. has unique capabilities that are specific to the taxonomic(s) for conducting site soils identification.  Cedarville Engineering Group, LLC has experi ence with the exact nature of this work based upon its experience in the urban soil taxonomic classifications based upon previous contracts with the US EPA.  No other contractor is known to have the experience and required expertise in this collaborative effort for gathering data that will be of use to the urban environment for meeting the challenge requested by US EPA's Regional Office under Consent Decrees for reducing stormwater flow to/and within their communities.  
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The anticipated award date is February 25, 2013.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. <br />This announcement serves as a Sources Sought synopsis issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a request for quotation. DO NOT submit a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis.
<p>BACKGROUND. <br />The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), Eglin AFB, FL, seeks potential business sources for development of a panoramic scene generation system for testing of visible and short wave infrared sensors. AFRL/RW's mission, as described in BAA-RWK-2013-0001 Research Areas 4 and 18, includes development of advanced weapon concepts, including test and demonstration of those concepts in hardware-in-the-loop test environments.</p>
<p>The Munitions Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base is responsible for development of advanced guidance and navigation concepts. These concepts might include panoramic vision systems that enable enhanced situational awareness, obstruction avoidance, terrestrial navigation, celestial navigation, object identification, object tracking, and other vision based functions. Sensed information can feed back into closed-loop control systems for flight control. Hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and sensor Man-In-The-Loop weapon targeting simulation of mission performance requires realistic stimulation of sensors for testing hardware and software closed-loop functionality.</p>
<p>Companies providing information should provide sufficient written information to indicate their capacity and capability to successfully perform research and development of relevant systems. If firms responding to this announcement are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) , they should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate if it is a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Information is sought regarding scene generation projection capabilities for HWIL stimulation of wide field of view and panoramic visions systems of the types described under the background section. Synchronized image updates at 60Hz or greater with flickerless intensity control (non-pulse coded) are desired. Spatially and radiometrically calibrated scene data, seamlessly projected to create at a minimum of 360 degree azimuth, 270 degree elevation image format is desired. Most optical sensors have a near focus capability, the minimum possible radius from the sensor to the image plane in order to maintain focus is expected to be around 2 meters. In other sensor types the near focus can be appreciably longer. The described capability should enable testing of sensors operating in the visible, near infrared and the short wave infrared spectrum. The range of operations should consider day and night operations. The sensors to be tested are assumed to measure within a single band, but multiple sensors may be tested simultaneously. A broadband projection capability that could be calibrated for the band a sensor being tested operates is needed. Simultaneous functionality within the visible and near/shortwave infrared is desired. Physical reconfiguration of the system to enable an alternate band would be acceptable if accomplished without major equipment reconfiguration. The ability to provide angular motion control of the optical sensor around an arbitrarily defined center point near the center of the panoramic environment is also desirable to provide rate data into the sensor under test.</p>
<p>Respondents should provide the following information:<br />A. Company name, mailing address, cage code, DUNS number, point of contact (POC), POC telephone number and e- mail address.<br />B. Business size status (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, Woman/Women Owned or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, small business, large business, etc.).<br />C. Experience in developing instrumentation grade projector systems of this type , description of the technical capabilities in regard to the projector systems, and capability to responding to the statement of need.<br />D. Capability of providing qualified and experienced personnel, with appropriate clearances, if required.<br />E. Past Performance. Do you have past performance as a prime contractor or subcontractor developing systems that meet similar requirements? If so, please provide the following information: Contract number, Name of Government Agency or Commercial Entity, Period of Performance, Dollar Value, Type of Contract (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, etc.), and an explanation of products provided as they relate to this Statement of Need. If your firm acted as a subcontractor or joint venture, name the prime contractor or other party, the specific work performed and percentage.<br />F. Does your company have the financial capability and financial stability, and/or adequate lines of credit to sustain and support a five-year multiyear contract at one or more locations, in the event there are difficulties with invoice payments? Do you have an approved accounting system in place to adequately track expenditures? <br />G. Do you typically engage in teaming arrangements? If so, please describe what kind of arrangements and types of services you would perform. <br />This Sources Sought is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses are limited to not more than 10 pages. The government will use this information, in addition to other information obtained, to determine its small business set-aside decision.

<DESC>1.	Statement of Purpose:
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is a diverse and distributed organization with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and Arlington, VA.  It also has 8 Regional Offices and the National Conservation Training Center separated across the United States.   Additionally, the Service has 700+ geographically separated field offices with a large variety network connections from commercial satellite in our more remote locations to a full DS-3 connective in the Washington, D. C. headquarters. The Service has a requirement for an integrated, multi-layered video capability that would support: 	Video broadcasting from the below locations to a static and mobile user base of 9000+ employees -	Washington, D.C. (Department of Interior) -	Arlington, VA (Headquarters) -	Hadley, MA -	Atlanta, GA -	Denver, CO -	Albuquerque, NM -	Sacramento, CA -	Portland, OR -	Bloomington, MN -	Anchorage, AK -	National Conservation Training Center, Shepherdstown, WV 	Flexible, multi-site, video teleconferencing and video broadcast capable of enhancing communications among all Service locations using existing video teleconferencing equipment, desktops and a variety of smart phone and mobile devices 	Video traffic, whether traditional video teleconferencing or broadcast, should efficiently use the limited network bandwidth of the Service Wide area network.  Multicast of streaming video is preferred. 	The capability to record video broadcasting, video conferencing and web conferencing events for later rebroadcasting or video library.  Broadcasting, rebroadcasting and video library (video products) must meet all federal mandated regulatory requirements to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The Service would need the capability to effectively store, edit and manage the content for video products.  The video products should be available on demand through variety equipment to include computers, smart phones and other mobile devices 	The Service will be required to store all recorded events with the ability to share the files with government and non-government agencies This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The purpose of this RFI is to identify current and emerging technologies capable of meeting the requirements listed above  Additionally, the Service desires a recommendation on what would be needed to integrate this equipment within the existing Department of the Interiors and the Services Information Technology infrastructure.  Any recommendations must be designed and implemented with an enterprise approach and flexible to enough to allow a multi-phased, multi-year implementation.
2. Project Description: 	 This project, when fully implemented will permit Service leadership to address all Service employees from anywhere, anytime using a variety IT devices.  Communications can be one-to-one, conferencing or broadcasting.  The successful solution should be designed to enable minimal set up time with minimal notification.
The USFWS currently owns a Cisco Codian 40 port video bridge and approximately 100 video teleconferencing systems spread out across the Service.  These systems are typically manufactured by Tandberg, Cisco or Polycom.   The Services video teleconferencing infrastructure is primarily internet protocol based with limited dial in ISDN capable.  These systems operate in standard definition limited to 384KB duplex video stream.
The Service vision for the Unified Video Communications project is to continue to use our existing video systems and to leverage the latest technologies in video conferencing and broadcasting to a variety of computers and mobile and smart devices.  The current capability requires scheduling time for systems and facilities.  The desired design still includes these systems and facilities, but will also be able to establish video communications ad hoc or on-the-fly with one or multiple parties.

3. Request for Information:
This Request for Information must include:
	The capabilities of existing and emerging technologies that meet the project description above.  	At least three case studies on how this technology is being used today by organizations with similar diverse and distributive architectures like the Service 	A recommended architecture that could be integrated with the Services existing IT architecture 	Capabilities of extending 2-8 cable TV channels (national news, CSpan, etc.) to the desktop 	An overview of the financial investment needed to implement, operate and maintain the recommended architecture.  This overview should anticipate an initial investment the first year with further expansion in the next 5-years.  Included in the costs, the overview should capture recurring costs, licensing, technical refresh, training and personnel full-time equivalent requirements 	The service provider and service provider deliverables must adhere to DOI information security policy.

<p>Specifically, NIST is requesting capabilities statements from prospective contractors capable of providing the following services, at a minimum:</p>
<p>a With the completion of the installation phase of the Thermal Shield Project , NIST has a requirement for engineering expertise that is deep-seated in the Thermal Shields's operation. From time to time the Shield is in need of repair or upgrade. This agreement is to cover the engineering expertise necessary for the NCNR staff to repair or upgrade the Thermal Shield in a timely manner.<br />b The services will be conducted on an "as needed basis" over the phone. <br />c The contractor must be familiar with the equipment and its operation. The engineering expertise must be diversified enough to be able to address mechanical, electrical, physics, and especially software issues without being trained on the installed system.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide engineering services pertaining to the Thermal Shield via telephone and/or e-mail.<br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide this instrument are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT- National Guard Bureau, United States Property and Fiscal Office for Oregon (USPFO for Oregon), intends to solicit and award a sole source contract to Astronics DME Corporation, 12889 Ingenuity Drive, Orlando, FL 32826  to purchase additional components for the existing Model 13505 Common EO Test System. The Black Spot Tester Model 13657 will attach to the Model 13505 Common EO Test System and use the supporting software upgrade for the purpose of testing Image Intensifier Assemblies for the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG), the Night Vision Monocular and the Aviator's Night Vision Imaging System. This device will replace the current manual visual inspection and, in turn, remove the human error that is commonly associated with this test. The software upgrade will improve the evaluation process for the 12 tubes so that we can reduce the number of acceptable tubes that are currently being disposed of due to human error. There are more than 500,000 NVG currently being fielded that use these tubes.

<a href="mailto:john.c.vandiver@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District is issuing this notice of sole source intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source for installation of an Electronic Security System that meets the specifications detailed below for HQ SOCSOUTH, Miami, Florida.   <br>  <br> The Government intends to procure the proposed contract action from Carothers Construction, Inc pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  However, other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  While this notice is not a request for competitive proposals, all information received before (15-February-2013) will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   <br>  <br> The material specifications are as follows: <br>  <br> This proposed procurement is for installation of an Electronic Security System (ESS) in the 123,842 SF Design/Build Headquarters facility for SOCSOUTH, which is a state-of-the-art command and control center comprised of real property, a back-up power plant, utilities, parking and other site improvements, that is currently under construction by Carothers Construction Inc under contract W91278-07-D-0026 Task Order 0005. The ESS includes installation of all cabling and end instruments including system control hard and software throughout the facility required to make the ESS fully operational.  The ESS will be operationally integrated with all building systems and connected for remote monitoring to several locations off site.   <br>  <br> Carothers Construction, Inc, has been found to be the best company that can install the ESS. The contractor has been responsible for design of the infrastructure required to support the ESS. The installation of the ESS is so integral to ongoing work that there is the potential that having a third party contractor on site would pose a scheduling and work interference risk to the government.  In addition, attempting to contract this work through a competitive process without impacting the current scheduled completion date is not possible. Additionally, having a third party contractor install the ESS after current contract completion to avoid construction conflicts is not an option since this would further delay operational certification of the facility until the ESS can be installed and certified.   <br>  <br> Notification and supporting documentation regarding this action may be submitted in electronic (pdf) format to Mr. Chris Vandiver john.c.vandiver@usace.army.mil. Responses must be received before 3:00pm Central Time on February 15, 2013. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. A solicitation is not available. <br>

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) manages the basic research investment for the U.S. Air Force (USAF). As a part of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), AFOSR's technical experts foster and fund research within the Air Force Research Laboratory, universities, and industry laboratories to ensure the transition of research results to support USAF needs. Using a carefully balanced research portfolio, research managers seek to create revolutionary scientific breakthroughs, enabling the Air Force and U.S. industry to produce world-class, militarily significant, and commercially valuable products.
<p>To accomplish this task, AFOSR solicits proposals for basic research through this general Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This BAA outlines the Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program. AFOSR invites proposals for research in many broad areas. These areas are described in detail in Section I of the BAA, Funding Opportunity Description.</p>
<p>AFOSR plans, coordinates, and executes the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) basic research program in response to technical guidance from AFRL and requirements of the Air Force; fosters, supports, and conducts research within Air Force, university, and industry laboratories; and ensures transition of research results to support USAF needs.</p>
<p>The focus of AFOSR is on research areas that offer significant and comprehensive benefits to our national warfighting and peacekeeping capabilities. These areas are organized and managed in five scientific directorates: Dynamical Systems and Control (RTA), Quantum &amp; Non-Equilibrium Processes (RTB), Information, Decision, and Complex Networks (RTC), Complex materials and Devices (RTD), and Energy, Power, and Propulsion (RTE). The research activities managed within each directorate are summarized in Section I of the BAA</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation: <br />W912L7-13-T-0001 <br />Agency/Office: <br />National Guard Bureau <br />Location: <br />USPFO for Tennessee <br />Title: <br />W-Linen Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in Lavinia, TN.
<p>Description(s):</p>
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0001 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812320 with a Small Business Size Standard of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the contractor with the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills.

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet.

<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

The Offeror shall submit information on contracts considered most relevant in demonstrating the Offeror's ability to perform the proposed effort. The Offeror shall submit a list of contracts either currently being performed or that have been completed within the last five (5) years for work similar in nature. Explain in detail the site conditions, mobilization efforts and the specific plantings completed to include number and type, planting locations, difficulties encountered, etc. For each relevant contract, the Offeror shall provide the name, contract number, address and telephone number of the contact. <br /><br />11. If subcontractors will be used for more than 50% of the work, then include a summary of their work experience and at least five of their most recent jobs performed for similar type work, with name, address, POC, telephone number of owner or prime contractor.<br /><br />12.&nbsp; Schedule B - Supplies/Services/Prices<br /><br />13.&nbsp; Section K - Certifications and Representations<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria:<br /></span><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered in accordance with FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical capability/ability and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer or other than the highest technically rated offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br /><br />1. Price - The costs will be evaluated upon the Offeror's ability to demonstrate associated costs with the project in order for the Government to determine reasonableness of price. A comparison of the proposed prices, government estimate and/or market values will be used. Cost realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort may be conducted. The Government will evaluate whether costs reflect a clear understanding of the program requirements and are reasonable and consistent with the various elements of the offer/quote. Offerors are put on notice that any offer/quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity of contract requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the offer/quote. In addition, the offeror must meet the requirement for responsibility as defined in FAR 9.104. <br /><br />2. Technical Capability - The Government will evaluate an Offeror's technical capability to determine an offeror's ability to meet the requirements identified in the plans and specifications. The merit of the offeror's proposed approach to accomplish the work identified in the plans and specifications will be assessed. This includes the reasonableness of the proposed work plan, scheduling and necessary certifications for achieving the project objectives. For an offer to be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of all requirements and demonstrate that, as a contractor, they have the technical capabilities identified above. The Technical Capability focuses on strengths, weaknesses and deficiencies in the Offeror's proposal. Offerors are advised that any strengths accepted by the Government may be incorporated into the contract as the minimum performance requirement. For the purposes of the proposal, a deficiency is defined as a "failure of a offeror to meet the Government requirement". The technical capabilities will be evaluated against the Offeror's ability to provide for sufficient staff and personnel with sufficient expertise to accomplish the contract requirements. The technical capabilities will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's ability to plan, control and integrate personnel necessary for successful contract performance. <br /><br />3. Past Performance - The offer/quote will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's relevancy and quality of past experience in performing the work described in the plans and specifications.<br /><br />Where the relevant present and past performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken, not just planned or promised action. If the Offeror clearly demonstrates that management actions employed in overcoming problems resulted in improvements achieved or problems rectified, this may allow the Offeror to be rated higher than might otherwise be indicated.<br /><br />All offerors will be given an opportunity to respond to any adverse past performance information obtained by the evaluation team for which the Offeror did not previously have an opportunity to address. Adverse past performance information is defined as information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element in past performance or contained in Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Past Performance Information System (PPIRS) or any less than satisfactory comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br /><br />Offerors without a record of relevant present and past performance, or for whom information on present and past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on present and past performance but will receive an "unknown" rating for the past performance factor.
<p>4. Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to price. Price may become more significant in contributing to the source selection decision if competing proposals offer comparatively equal Past Performance and Technical Capability. The Government will select the offer that represents the Best Value to the Government as stated above as well as the relative importance criteria established in the previous contract. <br /><br />Telephone, written, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will not be honored.&nbsp; Potential Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any subsequent amendments.&nbsp; Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).&nbsp; You may request an application via phone at 866-606-8220 or register online at <a href="https://sam.gov">https://sam.gov</a>. <br /><br />A formal site showing/pre-proposal conference has been scheduled as follows:<br /><br />DATE:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday, February 14, 2013<br />TIME:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9:00 a.m. Central Time<br />LOCATION: Coco Marina<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 106 Pier 56<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chauvin, LA</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>(i)</p>
<p>(A) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(aa) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(bb) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(cc) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(B) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)<br />(1) (i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)<br />(1) (i) (C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(ii) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>
<p>(ix) FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) is hereby incorporated by reference, with the same force and effect as if it were given in full text. The following have been tailored to this procurement and are hereby added via addenda:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Technical Acceptability<br />(ii) Price</p>
<p>The lowest priced offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If found technically acceptable award will be made without further consideration. If found technically unacceptable the government will evaluate the next lowest offer for technical acceptability until award can be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. Past Performance will not be evaluated, therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration</p>
<p>This will be a lowest price technically acceptable purchase. Technical acceptability - at a minimum - will consist of meeting all characteristics, including those above and the following:<br />Minimum Qualifications: QTY (13 EA) Cavitron Jet Plus or Equal.</p>
<p>Product should include a unit that is capable of performing a combination of ultrasonic scaling and air-polishing procedures. The unit must have a purge feature that allows the purging of waterlines to be conducted in order to maintain/comply with infection control standards. The unit needs a handpiece cable that allows a water/lavage control while in use. The unit needs to automatically maintain power as the Cavitron tip comes into contact with the tooth surface.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) Each offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Alternate I, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items (Apr 2011), and the provision DFARS 252.212-7000 (Jun 2005), Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, or ensure the Representations and Certifications are updated at www.sam.gov.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 to Solicitation W81XWH-13-R-0022 is to answer offerors' questions. If additional questions are submitted before the deadline for question submission they will be answered in a subsequent amendment.  This amendment includes 12 attachments - information related to the CoN process (see Q6 and A6) and a revised PWS reflecting changes made due to questions answered below.  Attachments can be accessed by clicking the Additional Documentation link beneath the Additional Info heading at the bottom of this page.  <br>  <br> See Amendment 0001 for Q1 and A1.  <br>  <br>  <br> Q2.  PWS Deliverable Number 1 states that the Software Package must be delivered within 5 days of the award.  We have a highly flexible CTMS which is already built and COTS, but is configured to the needs of each customer. Given the way that this requirement is phrased, it sounds like the complete software needs to be delivered within 5 days of the award, is this correct? Does this mean that the Army is not interested in having a tailored solution configured to your needs? It wouldn't be possible for any vendor to configure a system to meet the Army's unique needs (or anyone's needs for that matter), given the 5 day window. <br>  <br> A2: Deliverable #1 is referring to a non-configured copy of the software to be used to complete the CoN process, to be delivered within 5 days of the award.  Deliverable #3 refers to the additional twenty (20) software licenses that are due 5 days after option year 1 award. Deliverable # 4 refers to the Implementation Plan on how the vendor will configure the system to meet the government requirements.  This plan will be updated and provided to the government within 10 days of option year 1 award, and configuration is to be completed during the option year 1 period. <br>  <br>  <br> Q3:  I did not see any mention of 8(a) vendor preferences in the solicitation; are there any? <br>  <br> A3: There are no 8(a) vendor preferences.  <br>  <br>  <br> Q4:  One of the requirements states that the proposed solution is  quote mark Required to run on the following operating systems: Windows Server 2008 OS quote mark .  Does this mean that the entire system needs to run on Windows Server 2008, or just the database, or just the web servers, or something else? <br>  <br> A4: It is highly preferred that the entire package can be run on Windows Server 2008.  However, we could implement another OS if required.  <br>  <br>  <br> Q5:  One of the requirements states that the system must run on Internet Explorer 8 or higher.  Can you provide any guidance on how frequently CSSD updates their browser support? <br>  <br> A5: CSSD rarely updates IE browsers. CSSD is currently on IE 8 but will be moving to IE 9 in the near future. The PWS has been modified to state,  quote mark The system must run on IE 9 quote mark  (Attachment 1 to this amendment). <br>  <br>  <br> Q6:   Task 1 requires that  quote mark The contractor shall remediate network security vulnerabilities discovered during Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) testing in order to obtain a CoN. quote mark   The attachment that came with the solicitation mentions CoN checklists.  For the initial submission, in order to better address the requirement  quote mark The Offeror shall describe how the how the Offeror will collaborate with USAMMDA to remediate any security vulnerabilities discovered during the software testing in order to obtain a Government Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) quote mark , is it possible for you to provide us with the CoN checklists and other CoN requirements not detailed in the solicitation Attachment 1? <br>  <br> A6: Various security checklists (STIGs) that may or may not be used during the CoN process along with a sample of the initial CoN checklist are attached to this amendment (Attachments 2 - 12).  These checklists are merely a guide to reflect the type of tests that are conducted.  Characteristics of the actual software system proposed by the resultant awardee will determine which checklists are used during the CoN process.  <br>  <br> The STIG checklists supplied mention the Severity code of CAT I, CAT II, and CAT III. The CoN approval process requires that all CAT I findings be remediated. No CAT I findings are allowed during testing. CAT II and CAT III findings are less severe, and while they will be documented, they should not hold up the CoN process. <br>  <br>  <br> Q7:  The PWS states that CSSD requires  quote mark software licenses for twenty (20) users quote mark .  With our previous installations, we have not used a user-based license pricing model.  Does CSSD require a user-based pricing model, or are other models acceptable as long as they allow 20 users for the system (for example, an Enterprise license)? <br>  <br> A7: Yes other pricing models are acceptable as long as they allow 20 users for the system. <br>  <br>  <br> Q8:  The PWS also states that Deliverable 1 is  quote mark Software Package, including one copy of software and license, installation guidelines and operating instructions quote mark , and which is due  quote mark Within 5 days of contract award quote mark .  While we can provide a client with a copy of the code and installation guidelines, typically we work with the client's IT group to install our solution on the client servers.  Is it the case that CSSD would likely expect both:  a copy of the software for their files/records, and assistance in installing it on USAMMDA servers? <br>  <br> A8:  CSSD expects that within 5 days of the contract award we will have a copy of the software and license, installation guidelines, and operating instructions. The PWS states that  quote mark The contractor shall remediate network security vulnerabilities discovered during Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) testing in order to obtain a CoN. The contractor shall work collaboratively with USAMMDA staff to accomplish this task quote mark . CSSD will contact the vendor as needed for assistance with installation on the USAMMDA servers as part of the collaborative effort to remediate network vulnerabilities.  This support requirement does not fall within the 5 day deadline. <br>  <br>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the U.S Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), is seeking companies capable of  developing a transparent ceramic armor design which consists of the compositional grading of a ceramic-glass interface referred to as a Functionally Graded Material (FGM) approach (Figure 1). Specifically, this entails the interpenetration of two phases- the transparent polycrystalline ceramic phase with an amorphous glass phase. Specific materials of interest are: transparent nanocrystalline ceramics such as magnesium aluminate spinel and aluminum oxynitride spinel and silicate glass types, e.g., soda-lime, fused silica.  <br>  The transparency, while critical, involves post-processing steps of polishing the ceramic surface and is not the focus of this effort. This effort is focused on the mechanical properties enhancement that may be achieved by the FGM approach (versus the existing  quote mark laminate quote mark  interface design wherein a ceramic slab is essentially  quote mark glued quote mark  to a glass slab using a transparent polymeric material). The preferred extent of the compositionally graded phase thickness is approximately 0.1 inch but may vary up to 0.25 inch.   <br>  An example approach of the process might be to start with a physical mixture of nanocrystalline ceramic powder (A) and glass powder (B) that can be compositionally graded by mass or volume percent and sintered in that configuration. For example, as illustrated in the figure below, starting with 100% of A and 0% of B, then continuing, 90% of A and 10% of B, 80% of A and 20% of B, etc., until 0% of A and 100% of B is achieved. The volume or mass percent would need to be tightly controllable. The process is required to have the capability to sinter the nanocrystalline ceramic to near theoretical maximum density. It is preferred that the manufacturing process be able to produce a 12 quote mark x12 quote mark x1 quote mark  square geometry product , but this is not a requirement for this effort. Supporting evidence of the realization of this design with applicable microscopy which shows the microstructural detail and confirms the presence of the ceramic - glass FGM phase is required.  <br>    <br>  Firms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video, etc. and provide information of previous experience related to this type of work.  The information provided will not be returned. All data should be sent at no cost to the US Government NO LATER THAN February 21, 2012 to the US Army ARDEC. ATTN: Pamela Penaherrera Bldg 09 Picatinny, NJ 07866-5000, email: pamela.e.penaherrera.civ@mail.mil. In addition, please provide the firm's name and address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, and size of business (small/large).  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept written questions by email. This is a market survey to be used for informational planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  <br>    <br>    <br>

Without this experience with US DOD Tier I/II forces, both the safety of the Soldiers and civilian population is put at risk. <br>  <br> 2.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 534 - Charleston, SC is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 90 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>If the offeror is not the manufacturer of the quoted items, the Offeror shall submit evidence at the time of quote submission that clearly verifies that the Offeror is an authorized distributor and/or reseller of the quoted product and will provide the items on or before the specified delivery date. <BR> <BR>The buyer is allowing sellers to submit bids for alternate items, provided those items meet all of the salient physical, functional or performance characteristics specified by this solicitation.  Sellers MUST enter exactly what they are bidding (state either brand name, or equal, including make, model and description) into the blank description field in order for the bid to be considered.  The Buyer will evaluate "equal" items on the basis of information furnished by the seller or identified in the bid and reasonably available to the buyer.

<DESC><br />AMENDMENT TO NOTICE ISSUED TO CORRECT THE RESPONSE DATE WITHIN FROM FEB 6 TO FEB 11.<br /><br />Program Summary
<p>DLA is soliciting parties interested in a prime service integrator initiative for HMMWV Industrial Support Successor Contract. The contractor shall function as the Prime Service Integrator in support of all production/maintenance line of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) for which the Services assign to DLA line side parts support. The successor contract is scheduled to start in Jan 2014. This program requires the Prime Service Integrator to own, manage, kit, forecast and deliver inventory to the customer. The billing and payment cycle begins at the time of use by (or delivery to) the customer. Current performance sites are Red River Army Depot (RRAD). Limited stock deliveries are also provided to Maine Military Authority (MMA).</p>
<p>The Contractor will not be expected to perform the actual production/maintenance of HMMWVs, but will be expected to perform logistical support to maintain the production/maintenance lines by providing line side part support through supply bins and stocking points to ensure the parts are there when needed by the production/maintenance workers. As part of that logistical support the Contractor will both purchase parts directly and acquire parts from the Government, specifically DLA and TACOM. This initiative is designed to optimize the supply chain by having a prime service integrator:</p>
<p>1) Tailor its support to production/maintenance lines of a single weapon system and its variants,<br />2) To push its managed inventory to the line side bins and stocking points when and where needed by the production/maintenance workers, and<br />3) Allowing DOD to pay for materiel only when delivered for point of consumption use to the end user (Integrated Logistics Partnership Concept) by moving the point of inspection and point of sale to the point of use.</p>
<p>Please answer the following questions with specific examples and descriptions of your current or past experience in light of the requirements described above. If possible, please provide proper program names, contract numbers, and points of contact with each example.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #1

The purpose of this Amendment is to add the following sentence to Section III. NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE of this announcement:

The size standard for this NAICS code is $14M.

===============================================================

This market survey announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy at 3.2.1.2.1. 
	
This is a market survey.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey and/or meetings.  Any cost associated with market survey submittals and meetings is solely at the interested vendor's expense. 

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined for the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP).  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

I. INTRODUCTION

This market survey is the second announcement regarding the FFSP. This market reseach is a continuation of the information gathering process initiated under Market Survey 11279, which was posted on the FAA's Contract Opportunities website on 10 November 2011. 

The FFSP Program Office is looking to conduct communications with industry for assistance in identifying any vendors possessing special knowledge and unique capabilities. 

These communications and/or meetings are being conducted prior to the formal start of the acquisition process and will not be subject to any evaluation.  This is not a down select of any kind and non-participation will not disqualify vendors from subsequent consideration. 

Information gathered during the previous market survey and theses communications and/or meetings may be used in the development of the acquisition and the future draft Statement of Objectives (SOO). Information provided may also be used to assist the FAA in determining the eventual composition of the infrastructure under which flight services may be provided.  

Any proprietary or confidential information provided during communications and/or meetings should be appropriately marked and identified. Information not identified as proprietary could potentially incorporate in the FFSP requirements.

II. PURPOSE

The purpose of this market survey is to offer interested vendors and industry groups the opportunity to participate in communications with representatives from the FFSP Program Office regarding innovative methods and approaches to provide future flight services, which encompasses a portfolio consisting of Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS), Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) and Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS).  FFSP will be a service-based program; therefore, the FAA is not interested in pursuing a system-based solution.

III. NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE

The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330, Engineering Services. 

IV. TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION

Current and anticipated Federal budget constraints demand that the FAA continually evolve more cost effective methodologies of providing Flight Services to the General Aviation Community and other existing or potential Flight Service users while maintaining or enhancing the level of safety that can be derived through utilization of those services.  

The FAA envisions that FFSP will not be specialist-centric. Rather, the FAA anticipates that FFSP will provide easier access and enhanced functionality for pilots. Flight services will be automated to a greater extent, allowing both pilots and specialists to access the same data/information. 

The table provided in "Attachment A: Current and Potential Delivery of Flight Services" compares the delivery of flight services today with that anticipated for flight service improvements.
	
Interested vendors should be prepared to discuss the following topics during the communications and/or meetings: 

1.	Commercial and industry best practices that can be utilized to enhance providing flight services. 

2.	Innovative methods that the FAA and Industry might utilize to provide flight services. This includes, but is not limited to: 

	Restructuring, reducing, modifying, and/or enhancing flight services while considering effects on safety.

	Easier access and enhanced automated functionality to provide flight service for pilots while considering effects on safety.

	Government Furnished Information (GFI), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and/or Government Furnished Property (GFP) that potential industry partners may find beneficial in providing more cost effective safety enhanced flight services (Wx Products, Traffic Flow Data, etc.) and reduced transition risk.

	Potential to leverage 'Cloud' computing (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS) in a new flight services model (Storage / new applications).

NOTE: Although areas of interest are identified above, respondents are not restricted or required to address these areas and should not consider the areas as constraints in the response.

3.	Transition requirements concerns.

4.	Potential integration of NextGen Programs into flight services.  

5.	Alternative acquisition approaches to provide flight services that could provide continuous improvements in terms of efficiency at a reduced cost to the FAA while still considering safety. 

6.	Opportunities to encourage and increase small business participation in the delivery of flight services.

V. FFSP DOCUMENTS PREVIOUSLY POSTED

Previously released FFSP documents have been posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities web site, at www.faa.gov/faaco under Market Survey Announcement #11279 dated 10 November 2011.

<DESC>Previous Posting with changes are located at: The National Park Service (NPS) has issued Modification 2 to the Solicitation of a Prospectus to operate Lodging, Food, and Beverage, Retail and Other Services at Peaks of Otter with an option to include Operations at Otter Creek or Doughton Park or Both within the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Modification 2 provides one additional answer to a question asked by the due date of January 2, 2013: Is there an environmental report available for Peaks of Otter, Doughton Park, and Otter Creek that addresses any asbestos, lead, underground fuel tanks, etc. on the properties?
All documents related to the Prospectus are still available on the National Park Service Commercial Services website: http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm.
All offers must be received by the NPS at the following address no later than 4:00 p.m. on February 6, 2013 in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract. Please send proposals to: National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office, Attn: Commercial Services Office AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA 30303
To request a copy of the prospectus to be delivered via Federal Express, send a check for $50.00 payable to the National Park Service to Mark Morgan at the address listed above. Please include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number. You may also pick up a printed copy at the Superintendents Office at Park Headquarters for $45.00 (checks only).
If you have already obtained a copy of the Prospectus or choose to retrieve a copy from the NPS website please notify mark Morgan via email at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov, so you are placed on the mailing list to receive notifications of any future modifications or other correspondence.
One additional site visit questions and answers for Solicitation CC-BLRI011-13
Q: Is there an environmental report available for Peaks of Otter, Doughton Park, and Otter Creek that addresses any asbestos, lead, underground fuel tanks, etc. on the properties?
A. It is not clear what is meant by the term environmental report so we are unable to state whether the requested document is or may be available. However, the NPS has reviewed pertinent records concerning the existing Concession Facilities and found the following information:
The Service has reason to suspect there is asbestos or asbestos-containing building materials (ACM) in pipe insulation and the 8x8 floor tiles in the basement of the Bluffs Coffee Shop at Doughton Park. However, the Service has not performed any testing to either confirm or deny the presence of asbestos or ACM in the Bluffs Coffee Shop at Doughton Park.
In 1987, the Bluffs Service Station at Doughton Park had a release of gasoline, which was documented, mitigated, and monitored through the installation of ground water wells.
In 2006, the Bluffs Service Station at Doughton Park ceased to operate and the three (3) underground fuel storage tanks (UST) were removed.
In 2007, a Type II ground water monitoring well was installed at the Bluffs Service Station at Doughton Park. Records show that monitoring ceased in 2010. The Service does not know whether further monitoring (or any other mitigation measures) is required on this site. The North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (NCDENR) has advised the Service that Forever Resorts is still the responsible party.

<DESC>* Can the C-Channel frame (that I assume is used as a hold down for the pin) be removed to provide access for our machine tool? <br /><br />THE C-CHANNEL YOU ARE REFERRING TO WILL BE REMOVED BY THE GOVERNMENT PRIOR TO THE CONTRACTOR BORING THE HOLE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL REMOVE THE C-CHANNEL IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE EXISTING PIN.<br />
<p>* How will the anchor bar be secured to ensure that it does not move during machining and pin installation? <br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT WILL PIN THE MITER GATE IN PLACE AND STABILIZE THE GATE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO REMOVE THE PIN.</p>
<p>* What is the distance between the bottom plate and the bottom of the concrete trough (dimension A on the attached sketch)? What is the overall depth of the trough (dimension B)? <br /><br />SEE THE ATTACHED SKETCH WITH DIMENSIONS.<br /><br />* May we use several bolt holes that attach the plates to the c-channels to secure our machine? <br /><br />THE CONTRACTOR MAY USE EXISTING BOLT HOLES IN THE C-CHANNEL BUT THEY MAY NOT DRILL NEW BOLT HOLES.<br /><br />* Is tack welding an acceptable method of securing the machine tool to the c-channels? <br /><br />NO WELDING IS ALLOWED ON THE C-CHANNEL.</p>
<p>* We assume that the 0.25" lip on the pin should be maintained, meaning that if the diameter of the pin body increases to &Oslash;7.25", the lip diameter will increase to &Oslash;7.75". Is this assumption correct? <br /><br />YES. NEED SOME HEAD STICKOUT BUT EXACT DIMENSION NOT CRITICAL IT MUST STILL CLEAR THE EXISTING BOLTS.</p>
<p>* Will 120V 20Amp or 240V electrical service be available for our use on site? <br /><br />THERE ARE 120VAC, 20 AMP RECEPTACLES AVAILABLE BUT THERE IS NOT A 240VAC AVAILABLE.</p>

Web-Based Virtual Classroom with Interactive Learning Environment
SF 30 Amendment Continuation Sheet:
C.  Page 41, Paragraph E.2, FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Additional evaluation criteria is added.
     Determination of whether a proposed system is technically acceptable at a core requirement or sub-requirements level can be demonstrated in a number of ways:  access to a sandbox class (sample on-line class) in a test system for viewing compliance with the requirement, independent evaluation or narrative vendor description, for example.  However, the technical review committee will place heaviest reliance on the evidentiary material that can be independently verified by the committee, such as a sandbox review.  

The proposals may be submitted in either by mail or email and in either Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.  The technical and cost proposals should be in separate documents.  The technical proposal should not exceed 30 pages and the pricing proposal should not exceed 3 pages.  The pricing proposal should provide detail of all costs associated with the system as proposed in the RFP.  

The proposals will be evaluated based on lowest price technically acceptable proposals.  All evaluation factors (core requirements) except price, are in effect, evaluated on a "Go, No Go" basis.  Your proposal will either meet ALL core requirements or fail.  Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to price.

D.  Instead of using the SF1449, block 20, to include prices, use the attached bid schedule defined as Attachment 1.

E.  All questions and answers to this solicitation so far are summarized and are included as Attachment 2.

F.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

Attachment 2
Questions:
1)	Current usage levels for the platform in place at VA Nebraska are 1,000 users.   Our experience is that usage typically grows over time.  
2)	The solicitation indicates the following requirement, "Capacity to accommodate up to 1,000 users at any point in time."  Does this statement meant that: a) the system must be able to handle 1,000 concurrent users - i.e. 100 users online simultaneously; b) the system will have over the course of year; or c) both of these requirements? 
ANSWER:  The system needs to handle up to 1000 actively enrolled users and the system must accommodate up to 1000 concurrent (logged in) users. Your proposal should address 1,000 concurrent users.  There is talk of the possibility of growth.  If you wish, you may submit an additional alternate proposal that discusses additional users, which may be submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF document format.  It will not be used in the RFP evaluation. 
3)	We have found that customers want to expand to other modules such as the Community Engagement module or the Content Management module.  Is there a specific format we should use for this? 
ANSWER: Alternate proposals may be submitted in MS Word or Adobe PDF document format but will not be used in the RFP evaluation.  Alternate proposals must be a separate document from the main proposal.
4)	We will plan to submit our response as a digital/email copy.   Is Word format acceptable?  Is PDF format acceptable?    What time would you like responses submitted by? 
ANSWER: Either Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format is acceptable, although MS Word is the preferred document format.  Proposal submission may be either hardcopy or softcopy (digital/email) although softcopy is preferred. 
5)	We understand the current due date is January 31st.   We would like to request a small extension - ideally to February 5th, so that we have adequate time to develop a full response.  Will you be able to extend the due date and if yes, can you please let us know what date/time?  
ANSWER:  Amendment A00001 extends the proposal date until Feb 6, 2013 at 2 PM CST (Central Standard Time). 
6)	Who is the current hosting provider of the Blackboard based VLE currently in use by the MWM VERC?
ANSWER: Blackboard Corporation currently hosts the VA/VERC VLE education system.
7)	Is there a requirement to migrate existing VLE artifacts and data to the new VLE- classroom material, interactive training, and/or user information to include previous student activity?  If so, can you provide general requirements of the migration needs.  
ANSWER: The current VLE education system (currently hosted by Blackboard) has Classroom curriculum for 32 classes.  These classes have study videos, powerpoints, quizzes, exercises, discussion forums, blogs, journals, Wikis, document libraries, grade books, and grading rubrics. Several of the classes have links to upcoming collaborate sessions for virtual training and recordings of past sessions. These classes and all associated content will need to be migrated to the VLE education system if it is not the incumbent. The migration process must be such that the VHA does not have to rewrite, reformat or manually enter information that is in the current VLE system.  A number of sessions of those classes will be in-progress and must be migrated in a manner that does not interrupt the education process.
8)	Will this virtual learning environment be subject to Section 508 Compliance requirements?
ANSWER: Yes - This VLE education system must be Section 508 Compliant. 
9)	 For the base year effort, when within that time period would you expect the solution to be deployed?  We are trying to determine how much time we will have to modify our product to meet the VA requirements before it is deployed. 
ANSWER: The current VLE system contract terminates March 31st 2013.  We will have active classes during this time period.  A new VLE system, meeting all core requirements, including training and support would need to be available at date of submission.
10)	  The original posting date was 1/23/2013 with a response date of 1/24/2013.  This looks to be an error.  If so, can you provide the actual date you're needing responses by?
ANSWER:  The solicitation states issued 1/18/2013 with a response date of 1/31/2013 at 2:00 pm.  It has been extended by Amendment A00001, copy attached.
11)	 Is this a Request for Information (RFI) or Request for proposal (RFP) and whether or not there are any desired or required elements for the response?    For example, page limits, format, web addresses for demonstration, etc.  
ANSWER:  It is a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the requirements are defined in the solicitation VA263-13-Q-0434.  If you have not been able to download a copy from FedBizOps, please contact the Contracting Officer for an emailed copy.  Further description is provided in Amendment A00001. 
12)	  Let us know how many total FTE's (Key Personnel) are required under this requirement?  Do you need resumes?  
ANSWER:  Your key personnel are as many as you need to meet the core requirements.  Prove that you can perform ALL of the core requirements.  The proposal is lowest price technically acceptable.  Amendment A00001 changes the phrase, "technical and past performance, when compared with price, are of equal importance."
13)	  What are the things, do we need to submit with the Quotes?  
ANSWER:  Determination of whether a proposed system is technically acceptable at a core requirement or sub-requirements level can be demonstrated in a number of ways:  access to a sandbox class in a test system for viewing compliance with the requirement, independent evaluations or narrative vendor description, for example.  However, the technical review committee will place heaviest reliance on the evidentiary material that can be independently verified by the committee, such as a sandbox review.  Additional evaluation criteria added in Amendment A00001.
14)	  What would be the place of performance?  
ANSWER:  Since the requirement is web-based virtual classroom training with interactive learning environment, your staff will be at your location of business.
15)	  Is this solicitation to replace a current system or to add new capabilities to an existing LMS deployment.  
ANSWER:  The existing contract expires March 31, 2013.  This contract will replace/allow on line classes to continue.

VHA NCO 04 - 693 - Wilkes Barre, PA is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Sole source acquisition with Dr Candice Monson, to procure <br> Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Training. Training will include two-day training sessions at three locations. <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services: This acquisition is for Cognitive-Behavioral <br> Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) Training required at Fort Lewis, WA, Fort Polk, LA and <br> Hawaii, by Dr. Candice Monson and her certified facilitators. USAMEDCOM Operation <br> Order (OPORD) 10-70 Comprehensive Behavioral Health System of Care Campaign Plan (CBHSOC-CP) requires that all Army active duty Social Work personnel, Nursing <br> Case Managers, Psychiatric Case Managers, Nurse Practitioners and licensed behavioral health providers be trained to provide evidenced based treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting <br> from a single source. For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold,contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).  Reason for Cited Authority: The Soldier and Family Support Branch of the Department of Behavioral Health Sciences has requested that we bypass competition and enter into negotiations with Dr. Candice Monson. Dr Monson is the the sole proprietor and creator of the Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy treatment modality and the Cognitive Processing Therapy Manual, which is currently used at the AMEDD Center and School. AMEDD cannot adequately (with theoretical integrity) provide the quality of training required without Dr. Monson's team direct involvement. Therefore Full and Open Competition need not be provided for. <br>  <br> 5. Contracting Officer Certification: I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br> Signature: //orginal signed 1/15/2013//

<AWARDEE>STERLING MEDICAL ASSOCIATES, INC;411 OAK ST;CINCINNATI;OH;452192598
<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Care Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 is hereby publishing a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Sterling Medical Associates, Inc. 411 Oak Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45219, a large business.  The Central Texas Veterans Healthcare System located in Temple, Texas has a current community based outpatient clinic to provide primary care services and ancillary medical care services to veteran patient beneficiaries within the local LaGrange, TX catchment area.  Community Based Outpatient Clinics or CBOCS are established with geographical catchment areas that have an established veteran patient population outside of the greater metropolitan areas that larger VA Medical Centers are normally located.  CBOCS allow veterans greater access to care and take away the burden of traveling to larger cities often hours from their homes.  CBOCS often provide shorter waiting periods to receive care.  The LaGrange, TX CBOC is currently owned and operated by Sterling Medical Associates, Inc.  This six month contract is awarded on the basis of Unusual and Compelling Urgency, FAR 6.302-2.  The amount of the contract is an estimated $377,500.00.  The contract is a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract since it is not possible to accurately predict the absolute amount of veteran patients seeking care at the LaGrange, TX CBOC, currently the estimated population is 1200 veteran beneficiaries.  A request for quote/request for proposal will not be made available as this is a direct sole source award to Sterling Medical Associates, Inc. Direct patient care cannot be interrupted at any time.  This award allows for non-interruption in the healthcare of veteran beneficiaries living within the LaGrange, TX catchment area.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition<br />Denver Federal Center, Service Center<br />Contract Number: GS-08P-08-JA-D-0018
<p>1. Identification and description of action being approved:</p>
<p>The Denver Federal Center Service Center proposes to increase the maximum order limitation under the subject IDIQ contract for Option Year IV, May 15, 2012, through May 14, 2013. This increase covers the remaining performance period of February 1, 2013 through May 14, 2013 and will be accomplished through use of other than full and open competition procedures.</p>
<p>2. Description of supplies or services required:</p>
<p>The proposed modification is in support of Contract number GS-08P-08-JA-D-0018, Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Repair and Alterations (R&amp;A) Contract for the Denver Federal Center Service Center, Lakewood, Colorado. This is a line item IDIQ contract for minor repairs and tenant finish projects on the Denver Federal Center under $100,000 per task order. The vast majority of work performed under this contract is moving or installing gypsum board walls, painting, laying carpet, fire protection, minor electrical work and installing acoustical ceiling systems. The IDIQ contractor is located on site at Building 41 adjacent to the Denver Federal Center Service Center allowing for rapid deployment and delivery of projects for emergent and sensitive requirements.</p>
<p>3. Identification of statutory authority:</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.</p>
<p>4. Demonstration that the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:</p>
<p>The increase in the maximum order limitation for Option Year IV is considered urgent and compelling based on the fact that if this increase is not approved, the Denver Federal Center Service Center (DFCSC) will not be able to provide critical repairs and alterations in a timely manner as required. This inability will affect the overall performance at the Denver Federal Center Service Center.</p>
<p>A medical condition caused the recent retirement of the Contracting Officer for this contract and subsequently, the roles and responsibilities for the management of the IDIQ Contract were not clearly defined in a timely manner. The loss of a critical project team member and the failure to adequately track the total Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for Option Year IV led to the DFCSC Project Management Team scoping and defining six projects estimated to be worth a total of approximately $180,000. Tenant agency funding has been secured in a reimbursable work authorization (RWA) based on the proposals provided by the IDIQ Contractor's rates and costs. Without an increase to the MOL for Option Year IV, the DFCSC anticipates having to request schedule and monetary increases from the tenant Agencies.</p>
<p>The present Repair and Alterations Contract allows for a maximum order limitation in the amount of $750,000 for Option Year IV. To date, the total amount obligated on this contract is $735,000 (within $15,000 of being fully obligated). It is anticipated that an increase in the MOL will be required to cover repairs and alterations for the remainder of Option Year IV due to potential unforeseen conditions and other change orders on existing task orders as well as the scoped and defined projects already estimated by the IDIQ Contractor to include the following:<br />&bull; Building 41 US Bank Refurbishment $23,000<br />&bull; Building 41 OPM Remodel $60,000<br />&bull; Building 25 NIOSH Tenant Improvement $33,000<br />&bull; Building 41 Dry Erase Walls for Collaboration $7,000<br />&bull; Building 85 Insulation $3,000<br />&bull; Building 810 BMS TI $15,000 <br />&bull; Building 810 HR TI $40,000<br />&bull; Total Project costs $181,000 <br /><br />It is anticipated that an additional $200,000 is needed to cover the remainder of Option Year IV. This total includes $181,000 for the proposed projects and a 10 percent contingency for possible changed orders for unforeseen conditions on the awarded task orders.</p>
<p>If this request is not implemented immediately, the Denver Federal Center Service Center will not be able to accomplish needed repair and alterations in a timely manner and will add additional cost to the previously defined projects. Additional cost and schedule impacts for these projects are anticipated as follows:<br />&bull; Since a proposal for each project had already been requested from the current IDIQ Contractor, they had a reasonable expectation of performing the projects. There is no mechanism to fairly compensate the Contractor for the time and effort to submit the proposal if the task order is not awarded to the current IDIQ Contractor.<br />&bull; All budgetary funding requests will have to be resubmitted to reflect an alternate acquisition strategy leading to a duplication of work for all involved in the approval process and schedule causing delays due to internal and external routing of budgetary request documents. <br />&bull; The current IDIQ contractor maintains an office area and management staff saving GSA mobilization fees and limiting overhead costs. It is anticipated that proposals from alternate offerors will be higher due to increased overhead costs. <br />&bull; An offeror unfamiliar with the Denver Federal Center will need to provide proposals that require a rapid turnaround that may result in inaccurate pricing. <br />&bull; The previously scoped and defined projects will have to be formally solicited to another offeror and the Contracting Staff will incur additional workload to solicit these projects using a solicitation process in lieu of a task order process. <br />&bull; Additional site visits will be required with alternate offerors that would involve the tenant agency attending a site visit again. <br />&bull; GSA's mission is to provide superior customer service in a timely manner. Without this extension, we will be unable to provide this level of timely service to our tenant agencies.</p>
<p>Any delays in acquisition will impose a hardship for our tenant agencies on the Denver Federal Center. Therefore, it is requested that the maximum order limitation for the remainder of the option year be increased by $200,000 from $750,000 for a total of $950,000.<br /><br />5. Demonstration that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>The required additional repair and alteration projects will be awarded under the same line item pricing structure for the IDIQ Option Year IV consistent with the current contract. These prices were arrived through negotiations with an 8(a) set-aside contractor and were determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>6. Description of the market survey conducted:</p>
<p>A market survey will not be conducted since the work will be performed under the same line item pricing structure for the IDIQ Option Year IV consistent with the current contract.<br /><br />7. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>The Public Buildings Service and the Denver Federal Center Service Center Division's standard of providing quality and timely service would be negatively affected as discussed above in Section 4. Due to the failure to correctly track the MOL, six projects have been scoped and proposed upon by the existing IDIQ Contractor. We anticipate cost and schedule overruns as well as an increase in Government Associates' workload if the extension is not granted. The DFCSC cannot award a new Repair and Alteration IDIQ line item contract in a short timeframe due to the upfront work required to ensure a quality contract that meets our needs efficiently. The DFCSC is working on a new R&amp;A IDIQ contract, but the specifications need to be reviewed and evaluated, the description of the line items need to be rewritten, and several line items need to be deleted or added or combined into assemblies. The expectation was to extend this existing IDIQ contract for up to six months starting May 15, 2013 to accommodate these changes.</p>
<p>8. Statement of actions to overcome barriers to competition:</p>
<p>The Denver Federal Center Service Center has taken steps to ensure that an increase to the MOL will not be sought for the future line item IDIQ contract. We now have representatives from the Project Management and Contracting teams tracking the MOL, so that the information is known by more than one individual. This redundant tracking will eliminate the risk that an illness or other incapacitation will cause a similar breakdown in our processes and the service center will be better able to strategically utilize the line items within the MOL.<br /><br />9. Contracting Officer's Certification:</p>
<p>This justification for other than full and open competition to increase the MOL for Option Year IV of this contract is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. No additional supporting data is required to form the basis for this justification in accordance with FAR 6.302, "Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition."</p>
