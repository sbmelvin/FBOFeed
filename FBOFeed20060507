<DESC>The Senior Planning and Program Development Specialist is a key member of the Planning Team within the OMA Planning Division.  He/she will support the OMA Senior Development Advisors (SDA) assigned to the COCOMs to coordinate the evaluation, review and development of COCOM activities and USAID assistance programs and plans deemed of mutual interest and objectives within the COCOM area of operations.  This would include Theater Security Cooperation Plans, Information Operations Plans, emerging Stability Operations proposals, and USAID Mission and Bureau annual and sectoral planning documentation, among others as appropriate.  The Security Cooperation Plans represent DODs annual planning and budget document for most non-warfare programs.  

The Senior Planning and Program Development Specialist will assist the SDAs to link together USAIDs regional bureau headquarters and their field missions with the COCOM planning groups so that programs and budgets are developed that reinforce and support joint objectives and approaches in the region.   The Senior Planning and Program Development Specialist will also collaborate with the OMA Operations Division Program Manager/COCOM backstops to support the OMA Senior Development Advisors (SDA) who are assigned to the COCOMs to lead or facilitate the evaluation and development of USAID assistance programs of mutual interest that may lie outside of the Theater Security Cooperation Plan.  Of particular importance will be the development of Stability Operations plans and programs.  The PSC will help create new structures and interface systems that accommodate those additional activity reviews and program development; work on joint budget initiatives wherever appropriate; and ensure program integration.
