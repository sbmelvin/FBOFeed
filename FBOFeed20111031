<DESC>Program Description:<br />Applied Technologies for Landing Systems (ATLAS) was established to develop and administer an indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for providing engineering services in support of Air Force landing gear systems and related infrastructure (depot and field). Landing Systems includes: landing gear structures, rolling stock (wheels and brakes), antiskid systems, materials development/characterization, processes (e.g. Depot repair processes), business data (e.g. mgmt of systems integration). The engineering services are to support specific objectives which are generally built around mission safety, improving system life cycle cost, operational capability and performance, sustainment including maintainability &amp; support, and safety &amp; environmental friendliness. These engineering services efforts are in the areas of new design, technical documentation, diminishing material and manufacturing sources, environmental improvement issues, reliability, productivity, efficiency, and cost saving. One of the primary objectives of the program was to enable the ability to address rapid acquisition issues for the Applied Technologies for Landing Systems Program. ATLAS II Bridge does not include repair work and limited production runs. This is projected to be an interim contract between the current ATLAS II and possible future ATLAS III contracts. <br />Applied Technologies for Landing Systems (ATLAS) II Bridge

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice for Mammography 
The Veterans Affairs James J. Peters Medical Center, Network Contracting Office (VISN3) is issuing a pre-solicitation notice. Females over age 40 represent a small percentage of total patients in Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 3. Therefore, the mammography volume is not sufficient to enable us to provide comprehensive breast imaging services meeting quality and regulatory requirements at each of our facilities. The VA New Jersey Healthcare System (VANJHCS) is seeking breast imaging, screening and diagnostic services, and breast interventional services for veterans (and selected non-veterans) cared for at our medical center and community outpatient clinics, throughout the state of New Jersey. Services requested include all breast imaging and other diagnostic procedures for detection and diagnosis of breast disease in men and women. Inability to provide all services listed will not preclude a Contractor from submitting a proposal.
The contract period will run from date of award through September 30, 2012 with four one year options for renewal. This solicitation will be posted within the next 2 business days. This procurement will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 13, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

This Request For Information (RFI) is for planning and market research purposes only and should not be considered as a request for proposal or as a solicitation to do business with the Government. There is no solicitation package available at this time
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this RFI is to assist us in developing an acquisition strategy,&nbsp; performance work statement, and performance specifications to enhance the operation of wireless devices including cellular phones, smart phones, Blackberry devices, tablets and pagers of the Library of Congress (LOC). In addition, many Library of Congress staff rely on wireless devices to support their own communications needs. Beginning in 2003, the Library installed a Distributed Antennas System (DAS) referred to as the In-Building Wireless System to distribute cellular frequencies to specific spaces of the Library, mainly public spaces frequented by Congressional staff and the public.</p>
<p>The technology employed by the system is also outdated, limiting its capacity, and failing to support higher data rates and advanced wireless protocols. The performance of the system is steadily degrading resulting in permanent loss functions of voice and/or data services of in some spaces of the buildings.</p>
<p>It's the Library's intention to replace the system and upgrade technologies before the system degrades to a level that renders it inoperable for the original requirement. A study for replacement is requested to develop requirements, implementation plans, system design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any of the information furnished pursuant to this RFI request.<br /><br /><br />The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541618, Other Management Consulting Service, and size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />Please submit expressions of interest electronically in your own format to include documentation of capabilities in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company and its service possesses the necessary expertise and experience to compete for any acquisitions. <br /><br /><br />Additionally, interested parties are invited to provide best practices or designs to upgrade wireless communication being used in other Government facilities., as well as help us understand trends in technology and how to best prepare for&nbsp;future needs.<br /><br />Please ensure responses do not exceed ten (10) pages. Since this is a Request for Information (Sources Sought Announcement), no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.&nbsp;The due date for submission of this information is 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday, November 14, 2011.

<DESC>1. Title - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) Sole Source Pre-informational Notice
<p>2. Purpose - The purpose of this notice is to notify the community that about the upcoming RFP for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR). Upon review of the Biospecimen Core Resources and to make the most efficient use of the BCR resources, the TCGA program has decided to consolidate these services into a single resource.</p>
<p>3. The estimated release date for the RFP is 12-2011.</p>
<p>4. Background:</p>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing, gene expression analysis, and interrogation of epigenomic events. The scope of the program is to map and catalogue the genomic changes that occur in 20 major cancer types and subtypes from a variety of organ systems. TCGA is a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), two of the 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>TCGA Pilot Project Biospecimen Core Resource served as a centralized tissue processing center and provided the molecular biomolecules for the Pilot Project. In addition, the BCR collected and standardized clinical annotation. Standard operating procedures governed clinical data collection, sample collection, pathological examination, biomolecule (e.g., DNA and RNA) extractions, quality control, laboratory data collection, and biomolecule distribution to the Cancer Genome Characterization Centers and the Genome Sequencing Centers. The BCR ensured that samples and data were received by TCGA under appropriate human subjects review and informed consent, and also that Material Transfer Agreements represented the policies of the NIH for this project.

<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole-source purchase order to RAND Worldwide, Owings Mills, MD (formerly Avetech Solutions of Owings Mills, MD) for Services for Modification of the EPA?s Web Central Preventive Maintenance Module.  Period of performance will be 10 days.The EPA believes that RAND is the only source capable of providing this support service.  At the EPA, Archibus/FM and its modules are not just used by themselves in a standalone fashion. The EPA has integrated Archibus/FM into our Oracle database infrastructure, our ColdFusion Web development and all our Web applications ( e.g. RTP Locator, Property Management Database, Service Call Tracking, Task Order Tracking). This causes our software installation and support structure to be non-standard, not ?out-of-the?box?. A technician or developer can?t simply take the Archibus/FM upgrade CDs, plug them into our environment, and perform an upgrade. There is unique scripting and customizations in place that has to be accounted for before new versions of Archibus/FM or its modules can be installed or updated.Rand Worldwide (formerly Avatech Solutions) has been the provider for our customized version of Archibus/FM since it was first installed at EPA. They have customized many areas of the Archibus/FM database, and they are intimately familiar with our setup and installation. They provide unique scripts that update the customizations during an Archibus/FM software upgrade. No other vendor can provide that function because they don?t have the scripts. Over the last 14 years, more than a hundred EPA-specific customizations have been made to our Archibus/FM suite.  These customizations were made to address the unique facility management and customer needs and provide us with the ability to display customized data, not the generic titles that Archibus/FM provides ?out-of-the-box?.Using a vendor that utilizes the standard Archibus/FM scripts poses compatibility concerns. Without the use of Rand Worldwide?s (formerly Avatech Solutions) customized scripts, our ability to support and maintain the facility management system, which contains schematics for all of the EPA-RTP campus buildings, rooms, mechanical closets, electrical components and mechanical equipment, is negatively impacted.Since this procurement is considered a commercial service, simplified procurement procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.  The period of performance is expected to be within 45 days after award.   All interested parties who believe that they can provide these required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other sources exist and NO Request for Quotation (RFQ) is available at this time; consequently, any responses that fail to provide the aforementioned information, and instead just request a copy of the RFQ, will not be honored.  Submittals should be made to Anna Mustard (919) 541-4556 via email at mustard.anna@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><strong>I. OVERVIEW: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.</strong> This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes in determining interest and capability of potential small business vendors for this type of requirement only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of supplies or services. This Notice does not constitute a solicitation (e.g. Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Notice. All costs associated with responding to this Notice are solely at the responding party's expense.
<p>Responses to this Notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The BEP will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this Notice. Responses to the Notice will not be returned. Not responding to this Notice does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p><strong>II. PURPOSE:</strong> The Bureau of Engraving and Printing ("BEP") has interest in and is seeking small business vendors that can provide two (2) air scrubbers, along with performing the removal and demolishment of the existing scrubbers. The air scrubbers are to be used by the BEP's Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p><strong>a. Existing Scrubber:</strong> is a Centrifield Scrubber System Model 0202, originally supplied by Entoleter, Inc. The existing scrubber is aging and is exhibiting signs of wear and tear, thereby requiring replacement. The emission source consists of two weigh station hoods on the ground floor below the existing scrubber, which is located in the Ink Mill Penthouse. The ink making process is a batch process. Liquid ingredients are automatically weighed into an ink tub which is positioned under the exhaust hood. Dry ingredients are added manually into the ink tub. The exhaust hood positioned over the ink tub collects particulate matter and VOCs that become airborne during the weighing process. This exhaust is processed through the existing wet scrubber to remove the particulates. There are two weigh stations in the Ink Mill both of which exhaust to the scrubber. <br /><br /><strong>b. New Scrubbers:</strong> must meet the requirements of the existing air permit maintained by the Western Currency Facility. The air permit emission rate (EPN #14C) required by the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is 0.24 lb/hr for particulate matter (including PM10 and PM 2.5), and 1.10 lb/hr for VOC.</p>
<p><strong>III. Submission Requirements:</strong> Responses to the notice shall include the following:</p>
<p><strong>a. Company Information and Point of Contact ("POC"):<br /></strong>&bull; Company's Name<br />&bull; Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code<br />&bull; Contact information for identified POC, including e-mail, telephone number and facsimile number.</p>
<p><strong>b. Capability Information:</strong> Capability Literature and other supporting documentation that demonstrates your company's ability and certification to provide the subject supplies and perform the required services.</p>
<p><strong>IV. NOTICE POINT OF CONTACT INFORMATION:</strong> The point of contact for this Notice is:&nbsp; <strong>Name:</strong> Ms. Casey Meng,&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Phone:</strong> 202-874-9763<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>E-mail:</strong> casey.meng@bep.gov</p>

<SUBJECT>Juvenile Inpatient Mental Health Services (which consists of Juvenile Inpatient Facility Services and Inpatient Physicians Services)
<SOLNBR>RFI-200-0001-12-NC
<RESPDATE>111511
<ARCHDATE>11152012
<CONTACT>Jan R Johns, Contract Specialist, Phone (919) 575-2074, Fax (919) 575-2082, Email jjohns@bop.gov
<DESC>TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES:<br /><br />This announcement is posted as a Request for Information (RFI) only for an upcoming Request for Quotes (RFQ) that will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. This RFI is being issued to determine whether or not there are qualified sources that will be able to meet the requirements of this upcoming RFQ. The RFQ will be for Juvenile Inpatient Mental Health Services (which consists of Juvenile Inpatient Facility Services and Juvenile Inpatient Physicians Services) for male juvenile and female juvenile offenders held under the authority of various United States (U.S.) statutes.
<p>The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) houses juvenile offenders who have been adjudicated delinquent and committed to the care and custody of the U. S. Attorney General. In some instances, BOP resources are used to house and provide treatment for federally adjudicated juveniles who are under the supervision of the U. S. Probation and/or the U. S. District Court. <br /><br />The requirement will be for short-term mental health care services to supplement those not provided by the BOP. The primary population to receive these required services will be juvenile offenders who, during placements at a contract residential facility, demonstrate a need for mental health intervention, stabilization, and short term mental health treatment. Occasionally, services will be needed for cases where the Court orders the juvenile offender(s) to undergo psychological evaluation with regard to competency and special needs.</p>
<p>Currently the majority of the BOP's juvenile offender population is housed in the BOP's North Central Region. (To see a breakdown of the BOP's regional areas visit the BOP's public website at www.bop.gov.) No anticipated change is expected that would affect the BOP's current juvenile housing population. The potential offeror will provide inpatient mental health services to juvenile offenders from any of the BOP's juvenile residential facilities.</p>
<p>As stated previously, the requirement will be for Juvenile Inpatient Mental Health Services, which consists of Juvenile Inpatient Facility Services and Juvenile Inpatient Physicians Services. For Juvenile Inpatient Facility Services, the guaranteed minimum for the one-year Base Period will be 11 inpatient days and the estimated maximum for the one-year Base Period will be 732 inpatient days. For Juvenile Inpatient Physicians Services, the guaranteed minimum for the one-year Base Period will be 5 physician visits and the estimated maximum for the one-year Base Period will be 250 physician visits. The Government will satisfy minimum requirements with male juvenile offenders, female juvenile offenders, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is February 14, 2012 through February 13, 2017, if all option periods are exercised.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in this upcoming RFQ, please provide a written response to the questions below and send your response to Jan R. Johns, Contract Specialist, via email at jjohns@bop.gov. You are advised that providing responses to these questions will not automatically include you in the acquisition process for this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Are you familiar with and does your company qualify for any of the programs identified under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19? If yes, please explain. For example, what is the size (small, large, non-profit, etc.) and status (8a, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged Business, woman-owned, etc.) of your organization?</p>
<p>2. What experience do you have in providing juvenile inpatient mental health services? Please provide information regarding the type(s) of juvenile inpatient mental health services you provide.</p>
<p>3. The juvenile offender population that may require the inpatient mental health services may be sex offenders. Does/could your program provide inpatient mental health services for this type of offener? Is the treatment staff trained/licensed/certified or members of a nationally/regionally accredited sex offender treatment organization?</p>
<p>4. Are you currently operating a treatment facility that offers juvenile inpatient mental health services? Are there any other juvenile inpatient mental health facilities in the area?</p>
<p>5. Are there any state or local ordinances/restrictions that would prohibit or that would considerably slow down the procurement process (i.e. building permits or leasing/rental agreements)?</p>
<p>5. Are there any known local area concerns? Do you think the area would be supportive of the juvenile inpatient short term program? Are there any known groups or organizations that would oppose the juvenile inpatient mental health services in this area?</p>
<p>6. Are there environmental issues/concerns in the area?</p>
<p>7. Are there hubzone locations in the area?</p>
<p>8. What percentage of the work would you do with your firm's employees and what percentage of the work would you subcontract? If subcontracting opportunities are available, do you anticipate any difficulties in meeting the BOP's subcontracting goals with 8(a), small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled, or women-owned small business concerns as outlined below:</p>
<p>BOP Subcontracting Goals:<br />Small Business - 40% of total subcontracts<br />Small Disadvantaged Business - 5% of total subcontracts<br />Women-Owned Small Business - 5% of total subcontracts<br />HUBZone Small Business - 3% of total subcontracts<br />Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business - 3% of total subcontracts</p>
<p><br />10. Are there any zoning issues that would prohibit or slow down the procurement process?</p>
<p>11. Are there innovations in this area that the BOP could benefit from and if so, what are they?</p>
<p>12. Are there unique laws or regulations applicable to these services?</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC with project work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below and submit the capability information as described below. The references sited below with accession numbers may be found in the NRC's Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS). Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than 3:00 p.m. on Friday, November 25, 2011. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (Ashlee.Bushell@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Ashlee L. Bushell, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts, MS TWB - 01-B10M, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools, and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Commission established the current framework for risk-informed regulation by issuing a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Policy Statement that stated the use of PRA technology should be increased in all regulatory matters to the extent supported by the state-of-the-art and in a manner that complements NRC's deterministic approach and traditional defense-in-depth philosophy.</p>
<p>PRA is a structured, analytical process that provides both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates of risk by (1) identifying potential sequences that can challenge system operations and lead to an adverse event, (2) estimating the likelihood of these sequences, and (3) estimating the consequences associated with these sequences, if they were to occur. By prioritizing significant risk contributors and characterizing key sources of uncertainty and their impact on results, PRA serves as a useful decisionmaking tool that can help focus thinking and limited agency resources to ensure safety. U.S. nuclear reactor PRAs are used to characterize three regimes of accident progression. A Level 1 PRA models system (plant and operator) response to various initiating events that challenge system operation to estimate reactor core damage frequency. A Level 2 PRA includes Level 1 PRA analyses and, in addition, models system and containment response to severe core damage accidents to estimate conditional containment failure probabilities, radioactive material release frequencies (e.g., large early release frequency), and various source term characteristics. Finally, a Level 3 PRA includes Level 2 PRA analyses and, in addition, models the transport and dispersion of released radioactive materials to estimate various offsite radiological health and economic consequence measures.</p>
<p>A full-scope comprehensive site Level 3 PRA can provide valuable insights into the relative importance of various risk contributors by assessing accidents involving the reactor core as well as other site radiological sources (i.e., spent fuel pools, dry storage casks, and multiple units). These insights can be used to further enhance regulatory decisionmaking and to help focus limited agency resources on issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public health and safety. Although Level 3 PRAs have since been performed to some extent within both the United States and international nuclear industries, NRC has not sponsored development of a Level 3 PRA since NUREG-1150 . In the more than two decades that have passed since the NUREG-1150 Level 3 PRAs were performed, numerous technical advances have been made that were not reflected in the NUREG-1150 PRA models. The staff has also identified additional scope considerations not previously considered that could be addressed by performing a new full-scope comprehensive site Level 3 PRA.</p>
<p>During the Annual Commission Meeting on Research Programs, Performance, and Future Plans on February 18, 2010, the staff proposed a scoping study to evaluate the feasibility of performing a new full-scope comprehensive site Level 3 PRA. On March 19, 2010, the Commission expressed conditional support for Level 3 PRA related activities and directed the staff to provide the Commission with various options for proceeding that include costs and perspectives on future uses for Level 3 PRAs. On July 7, 2011, the NRC staff responded to the SRM by providing three proposed options for proceeding with the Level 3 PRA development project. These three options consisted of (1) maintaining the status quo (i.e., continuing with evolutionary development of PRA technology); (2) conducting focused research to address identified gaps in existing PRA technology before performing a full-scope, comprehensive site Level 3 PRA; and (3) conducting a full-scope, comprehensive site Level 3 PRA. On September 21, 2011, the Commission approved a modified version of the third option which extended the completion schedule from three years to four years.</p>
<p>Capability Sought</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of supporting the thermal-hydraulic and severe accident progression aspects associated with the development of a Level 3 PRA. This can include, but is not limited to, (1) determination or confirmation of system success criteria and (2) analysis or confirmation of severe accident progression for both the reactor and spent fuel pool.</p>
<p>Candidate contractors should have extensive practical experience in using NRC computer codes (e.g., TRACE, MELCOR, MACCS2) to facilitate (1) the determination of system success criteria in support of Level 1 PRA activities, (2) the analysis of severe accident progression in support of Level 2 PRA activities, and (3) consequence analysis in support of Level 3 PRA activities. Candidate contractors should also be technically creditable to respond to technical questions during ACRS presentations based on their in-depth knowledge resulting from their education and work experience.</p>
<p>Commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our full-scope, comprehensive site Level 3 PRA development project should provide capability information on your staff's qualifications and your firm's corporate experiences and qualifications on similar contracts or efforts. For potentially available and qualified candidates, please provide the candidates' educational background, relevant years of work experience, description of experience in performing calculations using the MELCOR code in support of PRAs and PRA-related activities, and any relevant publications.

<p>Special instructions for cutting and polishing of crystals: Si-111 and Si-220 single crystals needed for LUSI instruments, XCS and XPP monochromators. Quantity: Four in total. Break down: Two (2) in Silicon-111 and Two (2) in Silicon-220. Pair of crystals (two Si-111 or two Si-220) must be from same ingot. Crystals must be free of strain after polishing and etching. Final polishing requirement on diffracting crystal surfaces -- the surfaces facing the beam. But all surfaces should be free of machine damage and strain. The vendor will have to etch all surfaces for removing strain. All surfaces lapped to removed machining damage, all surfaces etched to remove any induced strain. Specifications for roughness/flatness: RMS surface roughness: 0.3 nm or better Optical flatness: Quarter lambda (at 638 nm) or better. Quarter lambda or better, peak to valley, is a minimum requirement. RMS numbers will be preferred for better understanding of surface flatness. A Strehl ratio number of 0.82 or better is a good equivalent, taking into account RMS deviations. A comparable number will work. Orientation accuracy (w.r.t crystalline axis of crystal): +/- 0.01 degree, with quoted extra cost to deliver this accuracy. Or best effort. (Definitely less than 0.05 degree).&nbsp; Vendor to specify instrumentation used to inspect measurements</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice

(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.
(b) Although "proposal," "offeror," contractor, and "offeror" may be used in this sources sought notice, any response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
(c) Any information received from a contractor in response to this RFI may be used in creating a solicitation.  Any information received which is marked with a statement, such as "proprietary" or "confidential," intended to restrict distribution will not be distributed outside of the Government, except as required by law.  
(d) This RFI is issued for the purpose of collecting information about an upgraded Teleradiology PACS (Picture Archive & Communications System) as described below.

	(1) VHA National Teleradiology Program (NTP) is VA's in-house teleradiology service and has been providing 24x7 teleradiology service to VA facilities for the past several years.  NTP is currently supporting over 35 sites across 12 different VISNs and is projected to double our workload over the next 2 years (currently >20,000 cases per month, 1/3 STAT).  We staff four reading center across the country (Durham, NC; San Bruno, CA; Menlo Park, CA; and Honolulu, HI) with the potential to add 2 additional centers as workload expands.  Our central teleradiology PACS archive (24 TB) is located in the VA Region 1 data center and each reading center has a local image cache server for LAN level image display performance.  Each VA facility is outfitted with an image/messaging gateway that manages DICOM and HL7 traffic between the local facility and the central archive in Sacramento and we have ~50 PACS workstations distributed across the 4 reading centers.

	(2) NTP is currently surveying industry to identify potential vendors who would be capable of providing NTP with a Teleradiology PACS Version 2 (NTP PV2).  NTP PV2 can entail modification/upgrade of our existing ScImage Inc. Picom system, leveraging the existing interface to VA's RIS, VistA, or it can be a comprehensive system-wide replacement with accompanying migration of existing images and reports.  NTP PV2 will have the following major characteristics which will be described in detail in a subsequent RFP:
"	Intuitive, stable and easy to use user interface for the PACS viewer

o	Viewer should be designed with a focus on human factors to optimize viewing efficiency, while minimizing viewer fatigue and the incidence of repetitive motion injuries.

o	Integrated worklist/viewing application with enterprise study locking across all reading centers within milliseconds to prevent duplicate reading within NTP.

o	Integrated ACR compliant peer review functionality with on demand and assigned workflows and associated reporting.

o	Seamless API integration with TeraRecon for advanced 3D visualization.

"	Option to use community/shared worklist or user specific worklist.

"	Integrated voice recognition system with server based profiles allowing users to rotate workstations with minimal to no user reconfiguration required.

o	VR reporting system must be able to support connection to 100+ VA facilities each with their own VistA based HL7 interface.

o	VR system must be able to handle parent/descendent exams and be able to copy/past reports into unlinked/associated accession numbers.

o	VR system will be designed with 99.99% uptime goal with failover redundancy. 

"	As all VISNs will be migrating to VISN-centric commercial PACS, NTP PV2 will utilize a high availability, fault tolerant VISN based image gateway capable of NTP defined lossy or lossless compression (selectable by modality) for transmission to the central archive.

"	Vendor must provide 24x7x365 technical support with off hours escalation to level 2 support within 1 hour of initial call.

"	Remote support will be provided via VA site to site VPN or through individual 1 VA VPN accounts with accompanying VA mandated information security and privacy training along with background investigations.  Vendor must agree to comply with all applicable VA security requirements.

"	System will be designed to optimally utilize bandwidth across the VA WAN with particular emphasis on the links between the Sacramento data center and the reading centers.  Vendor must selectively tune the application and/or network configuration of the servers (TCP Window) for the different bandwidth and latency conditions (50 Mb/s w/10 msec latency vs.  15 Mb/s w/60 msec latency).

"	Overall redundant, fault tolerant system designed for 99.99% uptime.

"	Intelligent study/workflow routing that directs study traffic to only those reading centers where Radiologists are on line (can be configured for dynamic detection based on user profile or scheduled).

"	VistA Web patient context interface

"	System will interface to VA's radiology HL7 interface which will require limited custom configuration on a site by site basis.  System will support VA's HL7 2.3 and 2.4 message formats and the interface will be via Radiology Patches 78/107 (report query), 84 (ORM/ORU), 106 (preliminary report deletion).  Note - extensive testing and validation will be required prior to initial deployment and to a limited extent for each new site activation.

"	System will be designed to accommodate site by site or VISN by VISN business rules for automated study QR based on pre-programmed criteria (CPT code, time of day, day of week, quantity and priority). 

"	System will provide outbound HL7 ORM/ORU messages to NTP's analytics system, Foundations by Health Level Inc.

"	Intuitive GUI based study management tool for image/demographic modification and reconciliation.

"	System will be a capital equipment procurement with a comprehensive 3 year warranty, covering hardware, software (upgrades/updates) and service/support. 

(e) Contractors that have a product that can generally meet the requirements above are encouraged to email full information to Daniel Czech at daniel.czech@va.gov.  

-	Contractors shall identify the NAICS code for the product being offered as well as the size status for said NAICS.
-	Contractors shall also identify any Federal Supply Schedules that may carry the desired product.

-	The NTP program office will also be attending the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) meeting in Chicago Il on Monday, November 28th to Wednesday, November 30th.  Contractors may schedule an appointment at the conference to display their product.

<p>Chemical Reagents for 384 Genotyping / Multiplex SNP</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Plant Science Research Unit, Raleigh, NC intends to award a sole source contract to Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Dr., San Diego, CA. The Plant Science Research Unit requires reagents for 384 multiplex SNP detection. The equipment would be used to gather SNP data for large numbers of DNA samples in conjunction with the Plant Science Research Unit's genetic investigation of complex traits of plants. In order to determine perform marker-assisted breeding, detection of 384 SNP for each of 1440 barley samples are required.</p>
<p><br />Reagents requirements:</p>
<p>Must be compatible for use on an Illumina BeadXpress instrument capable of performing barley SNP genotyping and multiplexing for 384 SNP per sample. Must have ability to genotype samples of low quality genomic DNA isolated using SDS protocol. Must be compatible with previously identified, standardized assay conditions requiring no assay optimization and permitting rapid establishment of new assays without redevelopment. Must be able to detect small insertions and deletions in addition to SNPs with the standardized assay. Must have demonstrated ability to do SNP genotyping for complex genome such as barley and wheat. <br /><br /><br />This research laboratory has an Illumina BeadExpress currently being used in their research which is based on Illumina, Inc., technology; therefore, ordering from another source would compromise the experiments and the integrity of data. The genotyping assay developed by Illumina allows 384 different DNA markers to be analyzed in 96 individuals from a single reaction assay. This high throughput genotyping method permits generating a large amount of data in a short period of time. These chemicals have to be purchased according to the work schedule to maintain their reactivity due to limited shelf life.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. The government intends to award this to Illumina, Inc. No other kits are compatible with this equipment. The anticipated award date is November 15, 2011.</p>

REQUIRED SUPPLIES:

BACKGROUND
The Contractor shall provide the Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 3 Imaging Services with a Nonionic Intravenous (IV) Iodinated Contrast Agent specifically for use during Computed Tomography (CT) examinations.  In addition, the Contractor shall appoint a Contract Manager to assist with logistics and other services relating to the IV contrast agent.  

This effort is part of the VISN 3 initiative to standardize commonly used products to promote safety, efficiency and cost reduction.

OBJECTIVES
VISN 3 Radiology Services seek to standardize the Nonionic Intravenous Iodinated contrast Agent used for CT for the following reasons:
	To promote patient safety and optimize Computed Tomography studies which utilize Nonionic Intravenous Iodinated contrast Agents available currently on the market
	To be fiscally responsible by securing the optimal pricing via volume purchase

Nonionic Intravenous Iodinated contrast Agents are drugs used to highlight specific areas inside the body so that the organs, blood vessels, or tissues are more visible. By increasing the visibility of all surfaces of the organ or tissue being studied, they help the radiologist determine the presence and extent of disease or injury.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The period of performance must begin 30 days after contract award.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
Performance must occur at the following locations;
Brooklyn VAMC - 800 Poly Place, Brooklyn, NY 11209
Castle Point VAMC - Route 9D, Castle Point, NY 12511
East Orange VAMC - 385 Tremont Avenue, East Orange, NJ 07018

SPECIAL MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
The Contractor must ensure the product expiration dates are readily visible and that delivered products expiration date is at least 365 days later than the delivery date.

OTHER UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
The IV contrast must be iso-osmolar and must demonstrate a minimized potential for renal toxicity, as there is a high prevalence of VISN 3 patients with chronic renal insufficiency and contrast media complications can affect long-term outcomes in these patients.
The Contractor must provide a Contract Manager responsible for the performance and logistics of products under this contract.  The contract manager must be available during VAMC administrative hours within 60 minutes of phone call to discuss performance or logistical problems with the COTR (Contracting Officer Technical Representative) or other government personnel designated by the Contracting Officer.  Administrative working hours for the VAMC is 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday, Eastern Standard Time.

Product recalls must be communicated by the Contract Manager immediately by overnight mail and by email to Stephanie Bellanger at Stephanie.Bellanger@VA.GOV.  

The Contract Manager must be aware of each VISN Imaging Services inventory par levels to ensure that these can be maintained based upon the availability of product.  The Contract Manager must communicate, at least monthly, with the customer (purchasing department or radiology staff) with a goal that the customer will never run out of product.  Each VISN 3 Imaging Service will appoint a point of contact (POC) that will monitor par levels and alert both the Contract Manager and the medical center purchasing department when product levels fall below par.  The VISN 3 Imaging Service POC will also alert both the Contract Manager and the medical center purchasing department when par levels drop to zero so that product delivery can be expedited.

Quarterly performance will be monitored and tracked by the customer and communicated to the Contract Manager to include, but not be limited to:
	Contrast Reactions  where the number of injection, (numerator), compared to the number of contrast reactions, (denominator).
	Number of occurrences where par levels fell below minimum
	Number of occurrences where par levels went to zero

The Contract Manager must provide to the customer educational opportunities, (electronic and hard copy) that result in approved CME hours for radiologists and CE hours for technologists.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302, Steris Corporation is the sole proprietor of this sterilization system and the maintenance thereof no other supplies or services will satisfy VISN 9 requirements. The Dept. of Veterans Affairs, Network Contract Activity, VISN 9 intends to make a sole source award to Steris Corporation with an estimated value of $90,688.00 for a base year plus four (4) option year contract for the purchase of an annual http://vaww.aams.ecms.va.gov/AAMS_Production/ContentManager/maintenance agreement. This product will be used at VAMC Memphis, Tennessee Research Department and will work in conjunction with existing equipment to maintain consistency and agency standardization.    

 SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: Under the authority of FAR 6.302, Steris Corporation is the sole proprietor of this sterilization system and the maintenance thereof, and no other supplies or services will satisfy VISN 9 VAMC Memphis requirements. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government  is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Maintenance of this system performed by the proprietor is essential to and has the only solution to meet the agency's requirements at the using service Medical Facility. Further market research and analysis indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking a particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. The medical center has found that with this maintenance agreement, the agency can maintain its current standardization requirement and consistency within the medical facility. The government would incur undo substantial cost and risk by using a different vendor that has not been certified and trained by the Steris Corporation on performing annual maintenance. The cost to compete in an attempt to procure different brand name product does not out weight the benefit of maintaining our current standardization and consistency within the agency's operating facilities. 

The cost for this requirement is $17,160.16 for FY12. This requirement will have 4 additional option years and the total cost including all options is $90,688.00.   
 

This notice of intent is neither a request for quote nor a solicitation of proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates an ability to meet the agency's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Monica Kinderknecht, monica.kinderknecht@va.gov  no later than November 7, 2011@ 12 pm Central Standard Time.

<DESC>The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures according to FAR Part 13.5.  Also, this is a commercial item so FAR Part 12.6 is applicable as well.
It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) to award on a sole source basis to DeLima and Associates of McLean, Virginia for the purchase of a non-exclusive license.  The specific license numbers are CPID12000, CPID13000 and CPID14000 for use of DeLima Associates proprietary Consumer Product Information Database (CPID) to be hosted on the National Library of Medicines Household Products Database web site. (No funds will be used to develop a database.)
The CPID was developed by, is maintained by, and is fully owned by DeLima Associates with no database development or maintenance funds provided by NIH except for the cost of a license for non-commercial use under certain terms and conditions.
CPID is a commercially available database that provides chemical ingredient and health effects information for over 11,000 brand name automotive, personal care, home maintenance, inside home, pet care, pesticide, hobby and crafts, home office and landscape and yard products. 
JUSTIFICATIONLanguage provided from SBA SBIR policy directive(7) For Phase III, Congress intends that agencies or their Government owned,contractor-operated facilities, federally-funded research and development centers, or Government prime contractors that pursueR/R&D or production developed under the SBIR Program, give preference, including sole source awards, to the awardee that developedthe technology. In fact, the Act requires reporting to SBA of all instances in which an agency pursues research, development, or production of a technology developed by an SBIR awardee, with a concern other than theone that developed the SBIR technology. (See Section 4(c) (7) immediately below for agency notification to SBA prior to award of such afunding agreement and Section 9(a) (12) regarding agency reporting of the issuance of such award.) SBA will report such instances, including those discovered independently by SBA, to Congress.
(8) For Phase III, agencies, their Government-owned, contractor-operated facilities, or federally-funded research and development centers, that intend to pursue R/R&D, production, services, or any combination thereof of a technology developed by an SBIR awardee of that agency, with an entity other than that SBIR awardee, must notify SBA in writing prior to such an award. This notice requirement also applies to technologies ofSBIR awardees with SBIR funding from two or more agencies where one of the agencies determines to pursue the technology with an entity other than that awardee. This notification must include, at a minimum: (a) the reasons why the follow-on funding agreement with the SBIR awardee is not practicable; (b) the identity of the entity with which the agency intends to make an award to perform research, development, or production; and (c) a description of the type of funding award under which the research, development, or production will be obtained. SBA may appeal the decision to the head of the contracting activity. If SBA decides to appeal the decision, it must file a notice of intent to appeal with the contracting officer no later than 5 business days after receiving the agencys notice ofintent to make award. Upon receipt of SBAs notice of intent to appeal, the contracting officer must suspend further action on the acquisition until the head of the contracting activity issues a written decision on the appeal.The contracting officer may proceed with award if he or she determines in writing that the award must be made to protect the public interest. The contracting officer must include a statement of the facts justifying thatdetermination and provide a copy of its determination to SBA. Within 30 days of receiving SBAs appeal, the head of the contracting activity must render a written decision setting forth the basis of his or her determination.
DeLima Associates is the only known source that is capable of providing a fully-functional health effects database of over 11,000 household products designed to be fully compatible with NLM-TEHIPs suite of chemical exposure databases. The database is unique in that, it compiles in one place, brand names of household products, and identifies, for each brand name, its chemical ingredients by chemical name and the chemical's universal identifier, the CAS Registry Number. This linking of brand names to individual chemical ingredients is a valuable component in integrating this information with the existing TEHIP databases that currently contain a wealth of health data on exposure to individual chemicals. In addition, for each brand, the CPID provides: acute and chronic health effects information, carcinogenicity and first aid information. The quality and accuracy of this database on NLMs Household Products Database web site is reflected in its high usage of over 35,000 page views per day. 
The CPID developed by DeLima Associates is the only commercially available household products health effects database approved by National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although other contractors may be capable of developing and populating a new database, funds are not being provided to develop or to populate the Household Products Database, instead, funds are only being provided to purchase a non-exclusive license to use an existing commercial database owned by DeLima Associates to continue to be hosted on the Household Products Database site of NLM. Since NLM does not own the existing product database it cannot transfer the licensed data contained in the Household Products Database to any other prospective bidder. A new awardee would be required to build a database from scratch at no cost to the government. It is therefore in the best interest of the government to use the existing and updated data through a license agreement rather than expend funds to build and populate a new database.
The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $25M. This is a 100% small business set-aside. NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about December 22, 2011.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCEThe period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award with two (4) one year options.
BACKGROUNDThe primary mission of TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and environmental health information. In support of this mission, the Program makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health effects of chemicals.
The advent of the web technology made it possible for TEHIP to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other information resources in and outside of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about the effects of exposures to chemical substances.

<DESC>The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures according to FAR Part 13.5.  Also, this is a commercial item so FAR Part 12.6 is applicable as well.
It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) to award on a sole source basis to DeLima and Associates of McLean, Virginia for the purchase of a non-exclusive license.  The specific license numbers are CPID12000, CPID13000 and CPID14000 for use of DeLima Associates proprietary Consumer Product Information Database (CPID) to be hosted on the National Library of Medicines Household Products Database web site. (No funds will be used to develop a database.)
The CPID was developed by, is maintained by, and is fully owned by DeLima Associates with no database development or maintenance funds provided by NIH except for the cost of a license for non-commercial use under certain terms and conditions.
CPID is a commercially available database that provides chemical ingredient and health effects information for over 11,000 brand name automotive, personal care, home maintenance, inside home, pet care, pesticide, hobby and crafts, home office and landscape and yard products. 
JUSTIFICATIONLanguage provided from SBA SBIR policy directive(7) For Phase III, Congress intends that agencies or their Government owned,contractor-operated facilities, federally-funded research and development centers, or Government prime contractors that pursueR/R&D or production developed under the SBIR Program, give preference, including sole source awards, to the awardee that developedthe technology. In fact, the Act requires reporting to SBA of all instances in which an agency pursues research, development, or production of a technology developed by an SBIR awardee, with a concern other than theone that developed the SBIR technology. (See Section 4(c) (7) immediately below for agency notification to SBA prior to award of such afunding agreement and Section 9(a) (12) regarding agency reporting of the issuance of such award.) SBA will report such instances, including those discovered independently by SBA, to Congress.
(8) For Phase III, agencies, their Government-owned, contractor-operated facilities, or federally-funded research and development centers, that intend to pursue R/R&D, production, services, or any combination thereof of a technology developed by an SBIR awardee of that agency, with an entity other than that SBIR awardee, must notify SBA in writing prior to such an award. This notice requirement also applies to technologies ofSBIR awardees with SBIR funding from two or more agencies where one of the agencies determines to pursue the technology with an entity other than that awardee. This notification must include, at a minimum: (a) the reasons why the follow-on funding agreement with the SBIR awardee is not practicable; (b) the identity of the entity with which the agency intends to make an award to perform research, development, or production; and (c) a description of the type of funding award under which the research, development, or production will be obtained. SBA may appeal the decision to the head of the contracting activity. If SBA decides to appeal the decision, it must file a notice of intent to appeal with the contracting officer no later than 5 business days after receiving the agencys notice ofintent to make award. Upon receipt of SBAs notice of intent to appeal, the contracting officer must suspend further action on the acquisition until the head of the contracting activity issues a written decision on the appeal.The contracting officer may proceed with award if he or she determines in writing that the award must be made to protect the public interest. The contracting officer must include a statement of the facts justifying thatdetermination and provide a copy of its determination to SBA. Within 30 days of receiving SBAs appeal, the head of the contracting activity must render a written decision setting forth the basis of his or her determination.
DeLima Associates is the only known source that is capable of providing a fully-functional health effects database of over 11,000 household products designed to be fully compatible with NLM-TEHIPs suite of chemical exposure databases. The database is unique in that, it compiles in one place, brand names of household products, and identifies, for each brand name, its chemical ingredients by chemical name and the chemical's universal identifier, the CAS Registry Number. This linking of brand names to individual chemical ingredients is a valuable component in integrating this information with the existing TEHIP databases that currently contain a wealth of health data on exposure to individual chemicals. In addition, for each brand, the CPID provides: acute and chronic health effects information, carcinogenicity and first aid information. The quality and accuracy of this database on NLMs Household Products Database web site is reflected in its high usage of over 35,000 page views per day. 
The CPID developed by DeLima Associates is the only commercially available household products health effects database approved by National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although other contractors may be capable of developing and populating a new database, funds are not being provided to develop or to populate the Household Products Database, instead, funds are only being provided to purchase a non-exclusive license to use an existing commercial database owned by DeLima Associates to continue to be hosted on the Household Products Database site of NLM.

<DESC>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. The Corps of Engineers Mobile District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Redstone Arsenal, AL and surrounding area. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br><br>Offerors are requested to respond to this Special Notice with the following information. <br><br>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Redstone Arsenal, AL and surrounding area?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<br>Mobile Engineer District contract?<br><br>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than 4 November 2011. Mail, or E-mail your response to U.S. Army Engineer District Mobile, Attn: CESAM-CT/Mr. Carl Wade, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628; E-mail - carl.m.wade@usace.army.mil.

The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned.

The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling.

All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><strong>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br /></strong><br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><strong>1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br /></strong><br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire on (To be competed at time of award) and that each such policy contains the following clause: "It is agreed that in the event of cancellation or any material change in the policy adversely affecting the interest of the Government in this insurance, 30 days prior written notice will be given to the Contracting Officer."<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Chemical and Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. Within the Chemical and Biological Division is the Threat Characterization and Attribution (TCA) Branch, which has the mission to conduct threat and risk assessments on both traditional and advanced agents; conduct experiments to close major scientific knowledge gaps; provide scientific support to the biodefense, chemical defense and intelligence communities; and provide the Nation with an operational biological and chemical forensics capability. The Chemical Forensics Program (Chem FP) supports the latter part of the above TCA mission. The threat of terrorist or criminal use of chemical threat agents is of great concern in the United States. There are vulnerabilities that create the need to perform chemical analyses for attribution in a rigorous scientific manner. As part of the effort to deter criminal and terrorist chemical attacks and strengthen the law enforcement response to such an act, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 22, a classified document dealing with domestic chemical defense, was issued. An unclassified portion of this document addresses attribution as a means of identifying the nature and source of materials, the perpetrators and the methods of chemical attacks.<br /><br />The primary internal customers of the Chem FP are law enforcement and intelligence components of the DHS, and the primary external customer is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) due to its lead investigative agency role in acts of terrorism. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to provide sound scientific techniques related to supporting attribution analyses leading to the capture, indictment, and prosecution of the perpetrator(s) of a criminal or terrorist act involving the actual or threatened use of Chemical Threat Agents (CTAs).<br />

Origin and/or F.o.b. Destination Evaluation (Apr 1984).<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p>(4) The provision at FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jun 2010) and below addendum applies.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.<br />(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the<br />designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.<br />(c) If no federal, state or local permits or compliance plans are required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite workplaces, then Contractor shall submit to the designated Port Engineer a letter, notarized under oath, that such documents are not required.<br />(d) Contractors will submit the following to the designated Port<br />Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: Data Sheets (MSDS) documents, certificates, specifications or any other manufacturing data verifying the VOC ratings of paints to be applied to the Cutter in accordance with MLCA Standard Spec 63000N, Section 5.3.1.</p>

<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1.

Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology Team (IT Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>9. SECURITY ACCESS: Secret.<br /><br />10. DIRECT SUPERVISOR: Director of USAID/ East Africa Office for Food for Peace.</p>
<p>11. POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Republic of Burundi recently emerged from more than a decade of brutal civil war and held democratic elections in 2005. It faces a host of complex food issues requiring Title II food assistance. Low agricultural productivity, limited non-farm opportunities, and lack of access to basic social services continue to hinder advancements in food security. In FY 2011, Burundi received has received $25 million in Title II food aid assistance, of which $8 million was for emergency food aid, and $17 million was for non-emergency programs.</p>
<p>To help determine the need for and improve, monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the assistance provided under the Title II food aid program in Burundi, the <br />United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications from U.S. citizens or Third Country Nationals interested in the position of Food for Peace Officer in Burundi.</p>
<p>With technical support from the Regional FFP Office based at the USAID/East Africa regional mission in Nairobi, the FFP Officer will ensure effective management of FFP resources in Burundi. The FFP Officer will ensure effective management of FFP resources in Burundi. His/her primary responsibilities will be to: (1) monitor, report and advise on the implementation and performance of ongoing Title II programs, including the technically-complex PM2A activities; and (2) assess and report on all food security issues, to include changes in the food security situation and food aid requirements, government policies and actions affecting food aid programs.</p>
<p>B. SPECIFIC DUTIES</p>
<p>The FFP Officer will undertake the following duties:</p>
<p>1. Serve as point of contact for all issues pertaining to Title II food aid in Burundi for the USAID Country Representative in Burundi, USAID/Washington, the regional FFP Office in Nairobi, other parts of the U.S. government, PVOs, international organizations, host nation governmental ministries and agencies, and others in the country.</p>
<p>2. Monitor and report on implementation of ongoing Title II programs, including performance of grantees, progress towards meeting objectives, problems encountered and commodity management, including following up on the status of commodity losses and claims.</p>
<p>3. Provide information and guidance to Title II assistance award recipients on Title II regulations, policies and procedures.</p>
<p>4. Report on all food security issues, to include changes in the food security situation and food aid requirements, government policies and actions affecting food aid programs, <br />government food aid programs, and donor pledges and programs.</p>
<p>5. Coordinate with the U.S. Government Country Team, host government, PVOs, international organizations, donors, and others to address issues impacting Title II food aid.</p>
<p>6. Undertake and report on assessments to inform Title II food aid funding decisions or modifications to ongoing programs.</p>
<p>7. Work with PVOs on preparation of annual work plans and program modifications, and with WFP and regional FFP staff on new appeals or revisions to existing ones.</p>
<p>8. Work with other parts of the U.S. government and other donors to promote integration of food aid with other programs to increase the effectiveness of the programs overall.</p>
<p>9. When delegated authority to do so by the FFP Director, serve as COTR for Title II programs.</p>
<p>10. Supervise assigned FSN staff.</p>
<p>11. Undertake other tasks, as assigned.</p>
<p>The basic duties and responsibilities do not change between the GS 13 and GS 14 levels. An employee meeting the qualifications for GS 14 and hired at that level, however, is expected to exercise a higher level of autonomy and require less technical support from FFP/Washington and the Regional FFP Office in Nairobi. Individuals hired at the GS-13 level who during the course of the contract meet the GS-14 minimum requirements, can be considered for promotion based on performance.</p>
<p>C. SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP</p>
<p>The FFP Officer will be supervised on a day-to-day basis by the USAID Country Representative in Burundi, but is expected to be in regular contact with the regional FFP Office in Nairobi, as well as FFP/Washington, to report any information pertaining to ongoing Title II programs. The regional FFP office is available to provide the guidance on technical food aid issues and support through regular visits. The FFP Officer in Burundi will be evaluated annually by the USAID Country Representative in Burundi, with technical inputs from the regional FFP office. The incumbent may supervise one or more FSN staff.</p>
<p>D. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<a href="mailto:amy.m.abate.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Aberdeen</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include additional questions and answers as follows:<br><br>1. QUESTION: When the pole camera is free standing and self supported, will there be a tether to the vehicle for power and data transmission or will the system be self powered and transmit data wirelessly?<br> <br>ANSWER: When the camera is free standing, the system shall have a generator for power. Data transmission will be wired. This data transmission line shall accommodate a total distance of 130' feet (this distance reflects the length of the data line from the top of the 30 foot high fully-erected  antenna mast to the base of the antenna mast plus an additional distance of 100' feet).   <br><br>2. QUESTION:If possible, please provide the specific vehicle platform to which the pole camera will be mounted (i.e. MATV, RG-31, etc.).<br> <br>ANSWER: All MRAP variants (All four categories) <br><br>3. QUESTION: What are the payload weight and sail area?<br> <br>ANSWER: The payload weigh and sail area needs to be minimized.<br><br>4. QUESTION: Is there a requirement driving this RFI? Is this requirement tied to a program of record? What limitations does the VOSS platform have?<br><br>ANSWER: This RFI is looking for a possible solution that could be addressed on any MRAP variant or similar armored vehicle AND as stated in RFI "change" Oct 13, 2011 REF is seeking a hybrid configuration; a vehicle mounted advanced camera system mounted on a 30 foot minimum height collapsible pole with the capability to be "detached" from the vehicle and set up as a free standing, self-supported system. Per PM CCS websitE(http://www.pica.army.mil/pmccs/d2counter/p2counterminesystems/voss.htm), the VOSS is limited to the RG-31 or JERRV mine clearance vehicles. <br><br>5. QUESTION: I know power will be an issue and it must be able to operate off of the vehicle battery. I assume there will be very little band width as well, is that the case? <br><br>ANSWER: NOT KNOWING THE POWER BEING CONSUMED ON ANY OF THE FOUR (4) MRAP VARIANTS WITH ITS AND ASSOCIATED CONFIGURATION (E.G.  RADIOS, NAVIGATION SYSTEM, ISR, ETC.), THIS OFFICE SEEKS TO GAIN AN APPRECIATION OF ALL POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS RFI REQUIRING MINIMAL POWER. A PROPOSED "SOLUTION" THAT REQUIRES/CONSUMES LITTLE/MINIMAL ENERGY IS VIEWED MORE FAVORABLE OVER A PROPOSED "SOLUTION" THAT REQUIRES/CONSUMES A GREATER AMOUNT OF ENERGY DURING OPERATION. Also would you like to be able to operate remotely? THIS OFFICE IS RECEPTIVE TO ANY PROPOSED CAPABILITY THAT CAN BE OPERATED VIA TETHER (SEE RESPONSE TO QUESTION NUMBER ONE IN Tuesday, October 25, 2011 9:41 AM EMAIL BELOW) OR NON-TETHERED. IF A NON-TETHERED, BE MINDFUL OF POSSIBLE NON-INTENTIONAL CO-SITE SPECTRUM INTERFERENCE.  <br><br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command -Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the Joint Program Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program, hereby issues a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in advance of the Pre-solicitation Conference for the Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) scheduled to be held on 16 November 2011. This is a draft RFP made available for comment prior to the Pre-solicitation Conference.  This is not a solicitation and no proposals are requested at this time.<br><br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a JSEW that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive equipment, such as weapon system optics and electronic equipment, in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination. The JSEW will decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination, supporting thorough decontamination of sensitive equipment without adversely impacting the operational life or performance of the target assets. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the JSEW by basing the design on the maturation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products is central to the acquisition strategy. An iterative Government evaluation process, combined with vendor-conducted product modification, is intended to provide Government design control after Milestone (MS) B, and is key to ensuring integration of the JSEW into Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS). The JSEW is considered to be a stand-alone capability.<br><br>Proposed products will be compared against the following criteria:<br>- Provides chemical efficacy test data (live agent or stimulant) for candidate against Nerve-G, Nerve-V and Blister-H. <br>- Provides complete Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and System Safety Assessment (SSA), which clearly identifies hazards (controllable and uncontrollable), active and inactive ingredients, product restrictions, and known safety hazards.<br>- Provides an analysis that clearly defines technology's compatibility with sensitive equipment, as defined in the JSEW Performance Specifications.<br><br>The draft RFP and associated attachments can be accessed from the solicitation link on this page or can be downloaded from the Natick Contracting Division website link below.  This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.<br><br>The announcement number W911QY-12-R-0006 will be the controlling document and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this Draft RFP. <br><br>The Government has announced a pre-solicitation conference for interested parties on 16 November 2011.  Questions received at least three (3) business days prior to the pre-solicitation conference will be addressed during the conference.  The full announcement for the pre-proposal conference and registration information is available on the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov under announcement number W911QY-12-R-0006.<br><br>Questions regarding this Draft RFP will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.greenwood@us.army.mil with a courtesy to peter.wallace@us.army.mil.

<p>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. A Small Business Sources Sought Notice was previously issued on October 25, 2011; Sources Sought Number: HHS-NIH-DA-SBSS-12-236.</p>
<p>Background. The NIH Common Fund was enacted into law by Congress through the 2006 NIH Reform Act to support cross-cutting, trans-NIH programs that require participation by NIH Institutes/Centers or would otherwise benefit from strategic planning and coordination. In October 2010 the NIH Common Fund launched Health Economics Initiative to address the evolving needs of the health care sector for economic research.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the Program is to foster the collection/compilation of data that will be most useful for policy relevant empirical scientific research (www.commonfund.nih.gov/healtheconomics). The implementation of health care reform poses numerous challenges and will need to examine the innovation in State health policy statutes concerning health insurance market regulations, the organization of health care services and approaches of controlling costs. One of the major challenges in health policy relevant economics research is to interpret the economic and clinical incentives structure inherent in State statutes which can be converted into statistically analyzable variables of raw data files. The NIH now intends to develop a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to address this challenge. Further information about the purpose of the project can be obtained from the NIH Common Fund Health Economics Initiative Request for Information to Solicit Input on the Feasibility, Scope and Design of a State Health Policy Database which was issued on June 29, 2011 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-11-019.html)</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.<br />NIMH is seeking information on all organizations capable of providing potential contract services for a project entitled: "Development of State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to Advance Health Economics Research on Health Care Reform".</p>
<p>The purpose of this initiative is to develop a research tool that will document state-level policies in a manner that facilitates valid comparisons across states and over time. Insurance regulation, Medicaid policy, financing public health services, and, many reproductive health policies are all under state jurisdiction. Health care reform will add two major activities for states: 1) the establishment of state health insurance exchanges and 2) the Medicaid extension - both of them are aimed at reducing the number of uninsured.</p>
<p>Currently no State Health Policy Database (SHPD) exists which can be easily used by academic researchers to assess the comparative differences in States' policies over time and the potential impact of health care reform. Different public and private organizations have state policy level information from their specific perspectives, but there is no one integrated database for health policy research.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>The SHPD is envisioned as a core, multivariate, raw data set with carefully selected numerical or nominal variables on prioritized health policy domains which can be used for statistical/econometric analysis by computer software.</p>
<p>Interested organizations must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to develop and manage a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) for research purposes, over a 5-year period (including potential updates).</p>
<p>The SHPD will be populated with CY 2010 data and available for release as a public use data set on or about September 2014. Potential updates of the datasets are scheduled for CY12, 14, and 16, depending upon the exercise of contract options. Sources will be required to develop a website to access the SHPD. Data sets on State tobacco control policies developed and sponsored by various organizations can serve as potential examples. <br /><br />Interested organizations must also demonstrate they have the capability and a reasonable plan to provide for updates of the SHPD beyond the base year CY2010 data (i.e., updates for CY12, 14, and 16).</p>
<p>Development of the SHPD with CY2010 data requires the following skills, capabilities and capacities of any organization:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge, experience and advanced training in health policy relevant research, specifically:<br />a. Knowledge and expertise in economic empirical research and econometric analysis<br />b. Legal knowledge of state health policy statutes relevant to current health care reform initiatives and ability to analyze the incentive structure of these statues<br />c. Knowledge and expertise to identify and prioritize the key policy and research questions in this area; sources will be required to convene and manage a one-day expert Scientific Panel meeting and to summarize its recommendations in this regard</p>
<p>2. Knowledge of and ability to access existing publicly available data sets and select most relevant variables for compiling the SHPD data set<br /><br />a. Knowledge of and ability to access existing CY2010 multistate health policy databases (e.g. Kaiser Family Foundation database, Urban Institute Database, <br />COMPARE microsimulation model developed by RAND, federally collected and maintained databases by CDC and NLM and other organizations, like National Academy of State Health Policy, etc.)<br />b. Ability to abstract needed data from above data bases and include them in the SHPD<br />c. Ability to prioritize what variables will be included in the SHPD and what other variables will be linkable only to the SHPD</p>
<p>3. Advanced information technology expertise<br />a. IT expertise including research database design and documentation<br />b. User friendly simple website design that will be incorporated into the National Library of Medicine health services research database<br />c. Basic knowledge of computer software for statistical/econometric analysis</p>
<p>4. Data management capabilities<br />5. Project management<br />6. Ability to test the data set by health economists researchers, present the characteristics of <br />the data set in person and via webinar to potential researcher users</p>
<p>Other important considerations.<br />No IT equipment will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. July 2012 - July 2014 (with options to extend performance through July 2017)</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought.</p>
<p>Capability statements should clearly state/describe your ability, experience, and resources to design and carry out the services above, including: <br />1) Staff expertise that would be working on this project, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training<br />2) Prior completed projects of similar nature<br />3) If a business, your business size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541720, 500 employees); and<br />4) Your management structure, history of your organization (e.g., number of years in business and DUNS #)</p>

<DESC>The term "Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics" (ADP) refers generally to this application of automated monitoring, condition prognosis, and incipient failure detection. ADP includes applications to mechanical and electrical equipment. It also includes self testing of digital systems, including calibration verification for digital system (I/O) interfaces. Properly designed and implemented, ADP can clearly benefit the safe and reliable operation of a fuel cycle facility or nuclear power plant. But it is also possible for failure or incorrect operation of ADP resources to inhibit proper operation. In addition, the implementation of ADP involves the addition of equipment and software, and tends to make systems more complicated. Added complexity, unfortunately, brings with it an increased potential for hidden or unanticipated couplings and dependencies, and ultimately the possibility of an increased likelihood of failure. The tasks under this contract will provide technical guidance, regulatory-based acceptance criteria, and recommendations for tools and methodologies (TM) to support regulatory evaluation of proposed applications of ADP. These tasks also include assistance to NRC staff in preparing review processes and inspection procedures. The results of this work may result in improved NRC regulatory guidance on safety system network designs.<br /><br />Please see attached request for proposal.

<DESC>Expression of Interest Sought
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under a lease in Baltimore, Maryland that will be expiring on August 9, 2012. The Government requires office and related space yielding 29,000 - 30,400 ANSI/BOMA. The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by August 1, 2012. The delineated area is the Central Business District of Baltimore, Maryland. Other applicable requirements include the following features:<br />&bull; 129 secured reserved structured parking spaces located onsite for official government vehicles.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Offered space must be capable of meeting the Government's Fire and Life Safety and accessibility requirements.<br />&bull; The building cannot be located in a 100 or 500 year flood plain</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:<br />Donna Welcher<br />Leasing Specialist</p>
<p>Expressions of interest must be submitted to the above address by 4:00 p.m. EST on November 17, 2011, and must include the following information:<br />&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available, and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet to be offered, and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced. Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />&bull; A floor plan in AutoCAD and PDF of the available space in the building<br />&bull; Date of space availability<br />&bull; Building ownership information<br />&bull; Amount of secured parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking.<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building<br />&bull; List of building services provided<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of individual to be contacted.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>Question 1: Do you want to use the 361 Interactive framework to build upon, creating<br>assessments that link to it, or are you hoping for modifications and<br>integration of several frameworks?<br><br>Response 1: Although many researchers have created useful cross-cultural competence<br>frameworks (including some funded through ARI), we are looking for a<br>comprehensive approach to model development.  To date, existing theories and<br>frameworks have lent themselves predominantly to self-report assessments.  A<br>more unifying framework is needed as the foundation for developing<br>assessments that have capabilities beyond those that already exist.  <br><br><br>Question 2: You also mention coming up with "methodologies that improve existing<br>measures."  We're familiar with many measures created to assess 3C; however,<br>we're not clear as to the specific measure(s) you are talking about.  Can<br>you point us to what you're most interested in?<br><br>Response 2: We are looking for new measures that improve upon the methodologies used in existing measures.  We are not attempting to make improvements to already<br>developed 3C measures, specifically.<br><br><br>Question 3: Is the assessment to be used for: selection; training; or selection and training?<br><br>Response 3: Any assessments should be able to be used for development, training, and<br>selection purposes.<br><br>Question 4: A warfighter's needs for 3C KSAAs can vary substantially depending on<br>Military Occupation Specialties, conflict phase, and other factors.  What level of granularity would be preferred for the suite of assessments?  By clusters of MOS?  By rank?  By something else?"<br><br>Response 4: The assessment should be developed in such a way that it can be used across the General Purpose Forces, irrespective to rank and MOS.  <br><br>Question 5: How does this solicitation relate to recently completed, similar work sponsored by ARI.

Large businesses will not be eligible for award if they fail to submit an acceptable Subcontracting Plan. Subcontracting Plans shall reflect and be consistent with the commitments offered in the Small Business Participation Plan.  In accordance with DFARS 215.304 (c), when an evaluation assesses the extent that small businesses and HBCUs are specifically identified in proposals, the small businesses and HBCUs considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any subcontracting plan submitted. <br><br>Small Business Subcontracting Plans will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE / UNACCEPTABLE basis:<br> <br>1.	Does the Subcontracting Plan adequately respond to each of the required elements of FAR 52.219-9(d) paragraphs (1) through (11)?<br><br>2.	Are the commitments in the Subcontracting Plan comparative to the commitments in the SB Participation Plan?<br> <br>USACE HNC's Subcontracting Goals are as follows:<br><br>  USACE small business subcontracting goals for FY11<br>Small Business	50.0%<br>Small Disadvantaged Business	17.0%<br>Woman-Owned Small Business	18.0%<br>HUBZone Small Business	10.0%<br>Veteran-Owned Small Business	8.5%<br>Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business  	4.0%<br><br>(b)	Volume of DoD Contract Awards:  Please list the total value of all A-E contracts awarded in the last 12 months.
