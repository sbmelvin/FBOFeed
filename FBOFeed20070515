NOTE:  (THIS BAA IS A RE-PUBLICATION OF DARPA BAA 07-19 SUSPENDED ON 13 FEBRUARY 2007)

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of survivability of microwave receiver front-ends from high energy threats.  The objective is to create a microwave receiver front-end which can withstand high energy exposure without compromising receiver sensitivity, bandwidth, or dynamic range.  

The objective of the Electromagnetic Pulse Tolerant Microwave Receiver Front-End program is to develop a novel robust and sensitive microwave receiver front-end capable of surviving high energy electromagnetic attacks.  The robust RF front-end technology developed should be scalable to operate within the 0.5-18 GHz frequency band over as large a fractional bandwidth as feasible while maintaining high sensitivity.  The program will culminate in a full system performance demonstration leading to military system transition opportunities.

Site locations for these projects may be at any Air Force base throughout the world although predominately within the continental United States (inclusive of Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam). 
Projects offered to contract awardees for negotiation are on a non-exclusive basis and at the sole discretion of the AFNAFPO contracting officer.  The projects may require the following services including, but not limited to: 1) Engineering review, 2) Planning, 3) Architectural programming, 4) Schematic design, 5) Design development, 6) Solicitation document preparation, 7) Landscape Design, 8) Interior Design, 9) Construction Cost Estimating, 10) Construction administration/management, and/or observation as a representative of the Air Force, 11) Value engineering, and 12) Air Force Design Guides, etc.  The projects may include any part or all of the Title I, Type A and B services and/or Title II, Type C services, and cover full design efforts (with or without Type C services).

The evaluation may take into account all sources of information which provide an insight into the firm's ability to complete design projects, including in part, the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS)/ Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) website.  Panel members will determine a consensus of the firm's past experience based on all available evidence regarding performance, including consultants and subcontractors;  6) Ability to Meet Client?s Needs.

Firms submitting packages that are deficient in terms of compliance with the requirements of this advertisement may be rejected prior to the commencement of evaluations.  The selection panels will rely upon the SF 330 package and information in the appendix for general information but the supplemental information must contain all information which is associated with the above evaluation criteria for rating the firm.  THE RESPONSE FOR EACH OF THE SEVEN FACTORS MUST BE COMPLETE (WHETHER THE RESPONSE IS REDUNDANT FROM A PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT FACTOR, I.E. YOU MAY HAVE TO REITERATE THE SAME INFORMATION IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE FACTORS TO FULLY DESCRIBE THE FIRM'S QUALIFICATIONS).

<SUBJECT>J -- Replace Cryomech Helium Compressor and cold head on Bruker 7T/30 USR Biospec MRI Scanner

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Bruker Biospin MRI, Inc , Billerica, MA for Cryomech Service.  The vendor will replace Cryomech helium compressor and cold head on Bruker 7T/30 USR Biospec MRI Scanner located at the Gerontology Research Center, Baltimore, MD including all charges for parts, shipping , labor and travel.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1),  FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Bruker is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Although the equipment to be replaced was manufactured by Cryomech, Inc., replacement of the cold head requires de-energization of the magnet followed by re-energization and re-certification via NMR testing.  Thus, Cryomech cannot perform this service.  Although other NMR magnet service providers have the ability to safely de-energize and re-energize generic superconducting magnets, the 7T/30 USR magnet is a very unusual, proprietary design requiring charging leads, power supplies and other service equipment available only from Bruker.  Moreover, the magnet is designed to be compatible only with the Cryomech cold head and associated helium compressor, so cryorefrigerations equipment from other vendors would not work with our magnet.  For these reasons, Bruker is the only vendor capable of providing the required service to our 7T/30 magnet.   The estimated period of performance is 3-4 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 334510 and the size standard is 500.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>This procurement is for a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order under FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certian Commercial Items. The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Maneuvering and Control Branch, Code 5600, has a requirement for engineering and fabrication support services to build a large (~20th-scale, approximately 55 ft. in length) High Speed Sea Lift (HSSL) SeaTrain Model, to support science and technology advancements associated with articulated Surface Effect Ship (SES) type craft, and test it in realistic scaled seas.  This work includes model design, test planning, testing, and overall project management.  The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to Alion - JJMA Corporation. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Alion Science and Technology is the developer of the SeaTrain concept that is being tested. It is a proprietary concept and only Alion Science and Technology has the licensed concept and experience with the previous test data.  Award to any other source would result in (a) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and (b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 30 May 2007, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to Heather Valiga by e-mail at heather.valiga@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 227-3476 on or before 05/30/2007.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River intends to issue a commericial small purchase to Rohde & Schwarz, 8661A Robert Fulton Drive, Columbia, MD 21046 on an other than full and open competition basis.  NAWCAD is purchasing an EMI Test System, which consists of the following equipment:

Item	Model Number
EMI Test Receiver 9 kHz to 7 GHz	R&S ESP17
Accessory: Artificial Mains
-9 kHz to 30 MHz
-Continuous current 15 A
-Remote Control
-V-Network ACC. TO:  CISPR, EN, VDE, ANSI and MIL-    STD-461 D and E
-Calibrated to CISPR 16-1, 1999 and ANSI C63.4	R&S ENV 216
System Software EMC32 for EMI Applications	R&S EMC32-E+

This system is being procured in support of the AIR-4.5 Avionics Division.  It has been determined that no other system is capable of meeting the Government?s minimum requirements.  Specifically, the Government requires a system capable of meeting the electromagnetic compatibility testing in accordance with military standards MIL-STD-461 Revisions C-E.  The system must have a frequency range of 9kHz to 7 GHz; functionality as both a true spectrum analyzer and test receiver (simulated spectrum analysis is not acceptable); Parallel Max peak, quasi peak, average and RMS detectors; built in preselector (9kHz to 7 GHz); built in preamplifier (9kHz to 7 GHz) selectable gain to at least 20 dB; built in tracking generator for 9kHz to 7 GHz frequency coverage; and built in internal tracking generator attenuator for 0 dBm to -70 dBm operation.  This is a notice of intent to award, not a request for proposals.  However, any company believing they can supply the necessary equipment should submit a capabilities statement to Ben Hansford, benjamin.hansford@navy.mil. The contracting officer will consider any responses.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command issued Solicitation N00024-06-R-3207 for Information Assurance (IA) support services through Seaport-e in March 2006.  Due to the reason that the government?s requirement can not be clearly defined it has been determined that awarding through Seaport-e as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) with Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) options will not meet the needs of the government.  Therefore, Solicitation N00024-06-R-3207 is hereby cancelled through Seaport-e in its entirety and readvertised.  

This performance based requirement will be competitively resolicited as a small business set-aside and awarded as a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP), Level of Effort (LOE) delivery order contract for the base year with four option years. The new solicitation number is N00421-07-R-0005.

<DESC>THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, PARTS I AND II, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. This proposed contract is an unrestricted procurement.  Services include, but are not limited to the preparation of facilities and land use planning studies and documents of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and such technical services related to such documents and software as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific (NAVFAC Pacific) for projects and activities at various locations worldwide, with emphasis in the Pacific and Indian Ocean Areas.  The primary tasks anticipated for the Architect-Engineer (A-E) are the originating and the updating of planning studies and documents.  Additionally, the A E may be assigned ancillary work to edit and rework incomplete or preliminary planning documents into final completed products based on technical knowledge and skills gained by professional training and experience in the planning and maintenance of military and government facilities and installations.  Planning documents, as referred to herein, include but are not limited to any document relating to Master Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, Regional Shore Infrastructure Planning (RSIP) Overview and Functional Studies, Special Planning Studies, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Studies, Land Use Studies, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Studies, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Studies, Military Training Studies, Space Studies (e.g., Administrative), Military Construction and Special Projects write-ups (normally on Department of Defense Standard Form 1391) with supporting documents (e.g., Cost Estimate, Site Plans, Floor Plans, NEPA documentation, etc.), Engineering Evaluations (EEs), Facilities Requirements Plans (FRP), Basic Facility Requirement (BFR) justifications, Facility Planning Documents (FPDs), Economic Analyses (EA), System Safety documents, Site Approval requests, Environmental Studies, Civil Engineering Support Plan, Land Inventory Analyses, studies, visual presentations, graphics, and/or any component or portion (not necessarily the entirety) of such documents.  Field verification survey work may also be an ancillary part of the planning process.  Any preparatory work, visual presentation, briefing, study, or report, which may be required prior to the initiation of any planning document listed, is also included under this contract scope.  Planning projects may include those for other U.S. Military Commands and Agencies (e.g., U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and other U.S. Agencies) worldwide,  in addition to those of the U.S. Navy.  The A E shall also provide all professional services required for the completion of planning documents, including researching data, conducting site surveys, preparing, reviewing, and editing technical text and graphics to ensure completeness and correctness of documents.  When such services are required of the A E for projects not wholly assigned to the A E alone, the A E must exercise professional judgment to verify the correctness and validity of the information, and the results and conclusions of the material the A E is called upon to finalize.  The A E must analyze, coordinate, correlate, synthesize, correct, supplement, and finalize the work assigned.  As an example of such an assignment, if the A E is called upon to finalize the draft of a document or a particular graphic submitted by NAVFAC Pacific, the A E shall rework such document or graphic until, in the A E's judgment, the finished product is correct, complete, and reflective of the A E's professional judgment and standards.  The A-E shall provide electronic deliverables for the publication of planning documents and the integration of source data used or generated during the planning process into the data libraries of the Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP-Link) information system.  The purpose of the RSIP-Link System is to disseminate Regional Overview Plans, Functional Plans, and Other Studies/Documents to customer Activities via the internet, to provide document management tools for programs such as the MCON and Special Projects programs, to provide a repository of references and interactive data libraries and to provide access to data spatially through a GIS interface.  The government utilizes the following software suite, which conforms to the approved Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) software suite:  Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstation, Microsoft Office 2000 Professional Suite:  PowerPoint 2000, Excel 2000, Access 2000, Outlook 2000, Internet Explorer 5.5, Netscape Navigator 4.78; and Adobe Acrobat 7.0.  In the preparation of manuscripts, word processing files, desktop publishing documents, and spreadsheets, the A-E shall ensure compatibility with the approved NMCI software suite.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to Define and Characterize the Research and Development of Microwave Generated Surface Plasmas. The support will involve researching the optimum design of initiators for generating surface plasmas using low-power microwaves. The contractor will be consulted on the design of a hypersonic, boundary layer model to be tested.    NASA/LaRC intends to purchase research from Old Dominion University Research Foundation(ODURF), who is the only known source that can satisfy agency requirements. ODURF for several years has engaged in the advanced state-of-art in microwave techniques as applied to plasma generation.  ODURF's investigators have specialized capabilities in plasma physics and spectral diagnostics. Unique spectral diagnostic techniques, developed by ODURF, will be available to extend the plasma characterizations to low electron densities. These capabilities, coupled with the need for research continuity without significant duplication of cost, justify securing a contract for these tasks with ODURF.

<CONTACT>Sylvia N Small, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-864-3640, Fax 757-864-8863, Email Sylvia.N.Small@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct a wind tunnel test in a Polysonic Wind Tunnel. The Ares I project is preparing an aerodynamic database that characterizes the 1st stage element of the vehicle during reentry where the aerodynamic effects are important for parachute deployment. This speed regime begins at separation, approximately Mach 6, and continues through splashdown.  The aerodynamic database will be used to determine the Ares I 1st stage performance, stability & control effectiveness and structural stability. An assessment of the Design Analysis Cycle (DAC) 2 Ares configuration is to be made at the mid-cycle review in September 2007.	To support this assessment, the aerodynamic database must be completed, reviewed, and delivered by August 2007.	 NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known responsible source. To support the assessment of the Ares DAC 2 1st stage element, the data to develop the aerodynamic database is required over the ascent Mach range.  A wind tunnel model has been built to test at NASA MSFCs Aerodynamic Research Facility, for the Mach range 0.5  4.96.	Due to the size of the tunnel, the effect of the shock reflection from the walls is a concern.  A larger facility with a similar Mach range capability is needed to test the existing model and thus reduce or eliminate the reflection of the shock off the walls.  The primary Mach range of concern is between 0.5 and 1.46.  The Boeing Polysonic wind tunnel test covers the Mach range 0.4  1.6 providing data for the reentry phase for Ares I 1st stage flight.  This facility allows the use of the existing model and sting hardware. There are no NASA facilities available with this Mach range and size. The Boeing Polysonic tunnel is the only known blow-down facility with the specific Mach number range, Reynolds number, and size to satisfy the wind tunnel testing requirement. Also, to eliminate tunnel to tunnel and database to database comparisons, similar facilities need to be utilized.  This eliminates some uncertainty in the aerodynamic database, thus reducing risk to the program.  The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 24, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511140   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Decontamination Team (NDT) intends to  award a sole source purchase order using the procedures set forth in FAR 13.5 to Thomson Micromedix for an annual subscription renewal of two internet-based and CD-based medical and hazard reference systems.  It has been determined that Thomson Micromedix is the only provider of this system and no equivalent alternative system meets the Government's requirements.  The Thomson Micromedix systems, TOMES and REPRORISK, combines 15 proprietary and licensed databases that  provide easy access to medical hazard and environmental information which provides On-Scene Coordinators, toxicologists and other Federal health experts with information to facilitate decision making in the field during Federal disasters, emergency responses and CERCLA removal actions.  The unique  features of the Thomson Micromedix systems are that they provide for field access via internet and hard copy CD in a very portable and easy to use format with a search capabilty to use one query to search all linked databases.  In addition, Thomson Micromedix has been providing this service for  several years to the agency, and although substantial market research has been conducted no other product seems to provide all of the features the agency requires. This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, NAIC code 511140. Interested persons/firms may identify their interest and must  demonstrate their capability in order to be considered for this opportunity. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is not a request for competitive quotes.  No competitive request  for quotes is planned; however, information submitted in response to this notice will be used to determine whether or not to open up this procurement for competitive procedures. Responses may be emailed to Christine Edwards at Edwards.Christine@epa.gov on or before May 30, 2007.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-483-07MR-2275

<CONTACT>Katheryn Hampton, Contract Specialist, Phone (304) 256-3367, Fax (304) 256-3332, Email hampton.katheryn@dol.gov
<DESC>The National Mine Health and Safety Academy is seeking GSA vendors that can provide the latest in digital color technology, brand name or equal to a Kodak NexPress 2500 Digital Five-Color printing press that offers the latest technology in color digital printing, along  with the Kodak NexPress NexGlosser.
 
We need the ability to reproduce any of the following work in-house:
 
?        Quick turnaround color
?        Variable data
?        Print on demand color
?        Electronic document warehousing
?        Electronic color reproduction
 
Over 50 percent of Agency printing is done by commercial printers contracted through the Government Printing Office (GPO).  
 
Examples of multi-color work, which would be done on the NexPress, are as follows:
?	Fatality Reports 
?	Hazard and Winter Alert materials 
?	Seminar booklets, signs, nametags, etc. 
?	Color covers for books, reports, etc. 
?	Flyers and brochures 
?	Academy Post Cards 
?	Color Photographs 
?	Pocket cards 
?	Most other products requiring full color with moderate quantities 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Minimum Requirements
 
Digital Front End: 
 
The Kodak NexStation IV will integrate with common workflows and can easily manage complex impositioning.  In addition all preflighting, color management, and resource management can be handled at the DFE.  The NexStation front end employs Adobe Extremme architecture for all aspects of processing. It is built around universally accepted PDF and Postscript file formats and the emerging PPML/VDX standard for variable data. The NexPress does not convert files to proprietary formats before rasterizing.
 
The NexPress employs a scaleable front end, with easy upgrades from one level to another. As volumes grow or new applications arise, we can increase our capabilities without losing the value of the previous investment in equipment or training.
 
Paper Stocks and Feeding Capabilities:
 
The NexPress prints on a full range of paper stocks -basic weights ranging from 16 lb bond to 130 lb cover stock (14pt)  coated or uncoated. It produces pieces up to 14 x 20.5 or A3+ size including full trim and bleed capabilities. The multi-feeder design makes it easy to mix up to 4 paperweights in a single printed piece. With multiple feeders our operators can change or add papers while printing to ensure continuous production. The total pile height of 26 inches reduces loading time and enhances uptime.
 
Electronic Collation and Duplexing:
 
The NexPress has the ability to electronically collate and print both sides automatically; it produces ready to finish sets. Conventional offset requires time-intensive drying process; the NexPress dryink technology eliminates this process.
 
Quality Control:
 
We need to achieve a level of consistency and quality similar to offset printing without the set-up time or cost. NexPress developed seven quality measures that together make up the NexQ technology that ensures consistent high quality output sheet to sheet week to week. There are as follows: Paper conditioner, automatic sheet positive, imaging unit, fuser, and same edge perfector, ECS and loop process control.
 
The color gamut is larger than offset because of the dry ink purity, there is a wider reproduction of color range with just four process colors. Colors are closer to pantone gamut. NexQ also includes an electronic environmental control system as an additional print -process stabilizer, thereby minimizing the need for expensive and difficult room control.
 
Ease of Use and Serviceability:
 
The NexPress 2500 is built with serviceability in mind. Many of the components in the press are easily replaceable by the operator. These are called the Operator Replaceable Components (ORCs). The service software component in the NexStation, called NexPert operator support system guides the operator in servicing the press, without having to call in a service technician under most circumstances. Because all issues pertaining to diagnostics, maintenance, and error handling are addressed in the operator support system, it enables an operator to increase machine uptime and thereby achieve greater productivity.
The Operator Replaceable Components (ORCs) are essential to the overall solution and provide the mechanism for the operator to maintain the press to achieve high uptime. Combined with the on-line NexPert operator support system, ORCs promote greater uptime, which directly affects productivity.
 
There are over 50 ORCs, each replaced in minutes by the operator. Each of the ORCs is replaced at periodic intervals to ensure the highest image quality and optimal performance of the press. These replacement intervals vary depending on the type of work being produced by the customer with varying job mix, DryInk coverage and printing substrates etc. Regular preventive maintenance performed on a daily basis by the operator, and proper handling and storage of the ORC optimise their yield.
Kodak NexPress Intelligent Coating Solution:  Allows you to add a flood or spot matte coating od dry ink as an additional protection layer.  Ideal for everything from book covers and direct mail, to greeting cards and postcards.  Produce authenticating watermarks on coupons, or communicate copyrights on proofs of portraits or legal documents.
 
 
Kodak NexGlosser Intelligent Glossing Solution:  In conjunction with the Intelligent Coating System, the NexGlosser Unit enhances image quality and produces a laminate-like gloss to images for higher marketing impact, greater protection, and a water repellent finish.  Excellent for book covers, photographic prints, greeting cards, and brochures.  A great application for information sheets that will be hung inside the mines.
 
 
 
The NexPress or equal to expectations. 
 
?	We will be able to produce brochures on-demand, no obsolete or wasted literature 
 
?	We can set up an intranet site to allow users to send their jobs electronically and send proofs back electronically. 
 
?	We will be able to provide quick turnaround customization capabilities without sacrificing quality and versatility of fine color printing. 
 
?	Last minute changes can be done quickly and easily without slowing production 
 
?	Easy updates and reprints of material 
 
?	Easier to meet quick customer demands 
 
?	Efficiently mange workflow press management and diagnostics 
 
?	We can buy necessary performance and add capabilities as needed 
 
?	Most repair and maintenance will be done by the operator, no need to wait for service calls

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Education for Income Generation and Conflict Mitigation in Nepal program is designed to respond to a root cause of conflict?exclusion of disadvantaged youth from relevant education, training and employment opportunities. This multifaceted program will combine literacy and life skills education; technical and vocational training linked to employment; training to increase agricultural productivity and raise rural incomes; and targeted scholarships for disadvantaged youth (e.g., internally displaced persons, low caste groups, ethnic minorities and girls) to increase access to primary, secondary and higher level (10+2 and college certificate level) education. A cross-cutting theme throughout all of these activities will be the provision of peace and reconciliation education for all participants in order to develop the knowledge, attitudes and skills for conflict resolution, peace building, and the promotion of human rights. The primary beneficiaries of this program will initially be disadvantaged, conflict-affected and internally displaced youth throughout mid-western Nepal. However, if Washington approves, the Mission intends to expand the number of target beneficiaries of this program to include former Maoist combatants. This is a five-year activity, including three base years and two option years, with an estimated budget of $12-$16 million.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SMC-07-0003
<RESPDATE>052507
<CONTACT>Missy Mitchell, Contracting Officer, Phone 310-653-3738, Fax null, Email missy.mitchell@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>This is an update to the Request for Information (RFI) and Sources Sought Synopsis posted on 1 February 2007 (Reference Number SMC-07-0001).  The Global Positioning Systems Wing (GPSW), Los Angeles AFB, has a requirement for Defense Advanced GPS Receivers (DAGRs) or equivalent.  At this time, the Government is anticipating a Sole Source Follow-On Contract with an estimated RFP release in fourth quarter FY07.  The probable ordering period will begin second quarter FY08 and extend through FY16, with a potential contract value of $650M.  The purpose of this notice is to determine if there are existing products that meet the requirements of the DAGR Specification, SS-M/V-600B.  For the DAGR Follow-on RFP, the GPS Wing anticipates a new specification, version SS-M/V-600C, which includes updates to reference documents and incorporates Specification Change Notices (SCNs).  Most importantly are the features related to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM).  Equal products (DAGR and accessories), shall provide the capabilities of the current DAGR, to include, but not limited to: worldwide positioning and navigation through continuous tracking of all satellites in view, direct Y- code acquisition, SAASM architecture unclassified-when-keyed operation and updated security features, upgradeable capabilities; and be interoperable with the PLGR/DAGR.  Performance and interface requirements are also contained in the DAGR Specification.  The current DAGR is manufactured by Rockwell Collins Inc.  Potential bidders may obtain access to the current specification and reference documents under the BIDDERS-DAGR-FOLLOW-ON repository through the online GPS Wing Program Library (includes Bidders Library) by contacting Lonetta Demings at gpslibrary@losangeles.af.mil or telephone at (310) 653-3208 or Capt Bryan Hogan at Bryan.Hogan@losangeles.af.mil, telephone (310) 653-3120.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Note:
The Department of Defense (DoD) recently mandated the PKI infrastructure requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to authenticate users via digital identification certificates, rather than the common User ID and Password.

As of 1 August 2006, before accessing the GPS Wing Program Library system each user must have at least one of the following PKI components:

DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or
DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html

Planned Contract Format:
(a) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract with option CLINs for DAGRs plus warranty and accessories.  Customers differ in their choice of accessories ordered with their DAGRs.   The following list is often ordered on a one to one ratio with DAGRs: RA-1 Antenna, DAGR to RA-1 Cable, Installation Mount, DAGR to External Power Cable, DAGR to DAGR/PLGR Cable, DAGR to PC Cable, Personnel Case, Computer Based Training (CBT), O&M Manual and Pocket Guide. (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)  The current DAGR contract includes 39 different accessories as part of an ongoing commitment to customer requirements.   The RFP may include a modification to existing accessories and/or the potential for new accessories.  

(b) Two production order options (DAGRs and accessories) are planned each year (approximately January and June), with the flexibility to move that schedule and to place additional orders if each order is valued at $1M or higher (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(c) Technical Services CLIN(s) will be Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) (ref. Attachment 2 - CLIN Examples)
(d) Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) (ref. Attachment 3 - Summary CDRL List)
(e) Integrated Master Plan (IMP), Software Management Plan, Information Assurance Plan, Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), Statement of Work (SOW), and Logistics plans are required as part of any proposal for this effort and will be incorporated in the contract, further description of requirement provided in reference (ref. Attachment 4 - Preliminary Portion of Section L and Attachment 5 - Section B through G clauses)
(f) The Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) portion of the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) is an essential part of the DAGR program.  The P3I plan is designed to improve the DAGR and its' accessories based on user inputs, which are reviewed by the Human Factors Working Group.  A potential P3I activity scheduled to commence in FY08 with an estimated production impact in FY10, is a manufacturing design improvement that utilizes a Single Die Key Data Processor (KDP).  This improvement would require commitment of funds and action on the part of the Government and significant commitment by the DAGR producer.  It is expected that this change would dramatically lower the recurring price of the DAGR by lessening manufacturing cost and risk.  It would also lower operating costs to customers by reducing power requirements for DAGR operation.  The Follow-On RFP will include a description of this P3I effort.  Offerors will provide an optional pricing table for the DAGR, contingent upon successful completion of this P3I. 

Price:
(a) Target price for DAGR (including 5 year warranty) must be less than $2,000/unit.
(b) Variable quantity pricing tables for the DAGR, accessories, and drawing packages is required (ref. Attachment 6 - Variable Quantity Pricing Table Example)

Schedule:
(a) DAGR Follow-on effort may result in a contract award with options to be exercised at a later date 
(b) Exercise of the first option hardware CLIN(s) is expected in the second quarter of FY08 (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(c) Delivery of DAGRs and accessories must start within 6 months after receipt of order (ARO) and be completed within 18 months after commencement of deliveries (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC - H007)

Additional program requirements are listed below:

Manufacturing capability: 
(a) Proven manufacturing capability (complexity, quality and volume) of same/similar product
(b) Ability to sustain an average rate of 5,000 receivers a month
(c) Approved SAASM vendor as prime or as subcontractor
(d) No GFP will be provided to assist in manufacturing or materials supply

Logistics:
(a) Agree to warranty (ref. Attachment 1 & 2)
(b) Ten year service life is required for the DAGR
(c) Provide depot supply support at no additional cost for the ten year service life (ref. Attachment 1 & 2)
(d) Agree to process for warranty exclusion repair.  Warranty exclusion repair will managed by the local DCMA office.  Agreement will be reached between Contractor and DCMA on which repairs are under warranty and which are considered warranty exclusion.  The warranty exclusion cost will be negotiated with the local DCMA until an average rate is negotiated, after that point the average cost will be reevaluated every 6 to 12 months and adjustments made if necessary. (ref. Attachment 1 & 2)
(e)  The RFP will include two option CLINs to support the transition from Contractor Logistic Support to organic depot capability.  Option one will address requirements to transition software support from the contractor to the Government.  Option two will address the transition of repair and logistic support capability from the contractor to the Government.  A notional description of the organic support requirements for these option CLINs will be provided with the RFP.  Offeror shall provide a detailed plan to transition either option one, option two or both.  This plan should also include description of any cost/schedule impacts to other program CLINs.         
(f) Provide a pricing table for Level 3 drawing packages for accessories other than the antennas (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(g) Computer Based Training (CBT) (CD and website format), Operation & Maintenance (O&M) manual (CD and paper copy), the DAGR Pocket Guide (electronic and paper copy) and Instructor Key Personnel (IKP) Training (documents and classroom training) are required, requirements defined in CDRLs.

Program Management:
(a) Quarterly Integrated Product Team meetings and weekly teleconferences

Security:
(a) This acquisition will contain classified material.  The production contract will contain a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD254).  Work performed under this acquisition may be classified up to and including the SECRET level.  Offerors must comply with security requirements found in the Navstar GPS Protection Guide.  Offerors must have Facility Clearance of at least the Secret level.  At the time of award of the production contract, the contractor must have a GPS COMSEC account with the Government.  (b) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: US procurement contracts for GPS Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) equipment must be awarded to US companies.  Foreign teaming, licensing, or subcontracting are allowed; however, the participating companies must clearly demonstrate that the hardware and software implementing the GPS cryptography are designed, built and integrated within US borders by US companies.  This requirement must be separately auditable.  (ref. Attachment 7 - Preliminary DD254, Contract Security Classification Specification found in the GPSW Bidder's Library)

<CONTACT>LISA HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3034452606     lhayes@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pink Elephant Inc, 1600 Golf Road, Suite 1200, Rolling Meadows, IL  60008 to provide product; Atlas Gold ITIL Toolkit with first year's maintenance. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for product for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other product/services will satisfy the agency's requirement.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition: 1.  Provide a complete description of the supplies or services:  Reclamation is in need of an Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) tool.  ITIL is a framework of best practice approaches and management procedures that have been set up within an Information Technology (IT) organization to facilitate the delivery of high quality information technology (IT) services.   The ITIL tool that Reclamation is in need of will need to meet the following requirements: (a) Provide Roadmaps (b) Provide Templates for ITIL related documentation (c) Provide step by step guides related to the implementation of ITIL and how to customize ITIL processes within our environment (d) Provide Project Plan documentation (e) Provide assistance in future implementations related to requirements gathering (f) Provide Flow charting capabilities (d) Provide details related to several ITIL processes, such as Service Level Management, Change Management and Configuration Management (e) Preference for web-enabled application that is managed and kept up to date by the vendor 2.  Describe why the proposed contractor is the only source:  Reclamation performed market research and contacted several sources either by telephone or by perusing the vendors' websites. Other vendors provide some of the services but not all services as described above.  Pink Elephant was the only source known to Reclamation as a result of the market research that offered all services required.  Reclamation's decision to choose this vendor is based on the type of services offered (a one stop shop if you will) as well as a significant cost savings (based on going out to separate vendors to get all the services required). 4.  Additional facts that support the sole source vendor:  Market Research provides data that this source (Pink Elephant) is the only vendor that can provide the services requested by Reclamation. Firms that believe they can provide the required product/services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar products/services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the product/service identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at lhayes@do.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 611710 which is $6.5 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8(a) firms to conduct a threat assessment and pilot surveillance project for the newly established Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument (Monument)
On June 15, 2006, George Bush established Monument by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain.  The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world. 
  
Due to the size of the NWHI region, its remote location, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of management in the area, a threat assessment geared at the protection of the resources from the deep ocean to the land has not been conducted.  Characterizing and evaluating threats to the area coming from human activities such as illegal access, poaching, and unforeseen concerns arising from innovations in maritime technology will be an important part of this assessment.  Threats to the NWHI have been previously researched through the identification of a number of relevant data sets and an enforcement workshop geared at identifying solutions to remote enforcement issues in the area.  However, these have not been comprehensively evaluated or prioritized.  Therefore, the first task is to conduct a thorough threat assessment working with the co-trustee management agencies (NOAA, USFWS, and the State of Hawaii), the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Defense, and relevant non-governmental entities.  This assessment will utilize to the extent necessary, public, commercial, classified and de-classified data to identify threats.  These threats should be prioritized by potential impact and probability of occurring, as well as geographically referenced.

The second task includes a review of the threat assessment with the management and enforcement agencies and an evaluation of existing assets for surveillance.  AIS, RadarSat imagery and sonar buoy arrays have been used by various agencies in the past, and potentially could be woven together for Monument management purposes in the future.  Identifying and evaluating these assets are important steps in creating an effective surveillance plan for the Monument.  The applicant should have DOD security clearance that would allow them to evaluate the utility of military assets and data sets for surveillance purposes.  

Many surveillance tools have been proposed for the Monument, including satellite surveillance, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), radar, AIS, SONAR arrays, etc.  However, they have not been evaluated against a comprehensive threat assessment, and compared by cost to benefit, and feasibility.  This analysis will be used to develop a prioritized list of short, medium and long-term surveillance solutions for the Monument.

A small-scale pilot demonstration project will be selected from the prioritized list of solutions discussed above.  This project should demonstrate the capacity to conduct remote surveillance in the Monument, and should not be dependent upon the construction of significant infrastructure.

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS code 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  

NOAA intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for the work described above.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information.  Offerors should include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide technically acceptable deliverables. Responding firms should provide their capability statement to Contract Specialist, Stephanie Garnett by email at Stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov no later than May 22, 2007. Capability Statements received after this date will not be considered.  All questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the Contract Specialist at 808-944-2228.

<DESC>TITLE: CMSO Surveyor Training
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide comprehensive training and instructional services on a revised process for State and Federal personnel (surveyors) who inspect/survey the Nations' nursing homes.  Although all small businesses are encouraged to respond, CMS wishes to assess the possibility of a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or HubZone Small Business Set-Aside.

As part of its ongoing efforts to improve the nursing home survey process to achieve greater accuracy and consistency, CMS undertook developing an improved standard survey process.  After a six-year developmental effort, improvements to the survey process are now incorporated into a fundamentally different survey named the Quality Indicator Survey (QIS).  The new QIS process includes the use of portable tablet computers with custom designed software to complete some of the tasks of the survey.  The CMS expects to implement QIS nationwide beginning with a few selected States in the fall of 2007. 

The government seeks to identify any businesses that are currently capable of providing the following scope of services: 

1.	Conducting classroom training of State surveyors and field training of State surveyors on the new QIS process for nursing home inspections.
2.	Conducting training of a State?s trainers on the new QIS process for nursing home inspections.  
3.	Conducting an evaluation of the participants trained as surveyors and those participants trained as trainers to assess competency with the new process for nursing home surveys.

<DESC>1.0 Description.  1.1 The Resource Planning Office (RPO) within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seeks information on how best to meet the developing need within the FBI for the creation for an enterprise approach to business intelligence.  The FBI has procured the Microstrategy software application and is considering the most appropriate approach forward to leverage the investment in the capability so that it can extend it to the entire enterprise.  1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  2.0 Background: 2.1 Contextual History  In 2004 the FBI made a substantial investment in the Microstrategy software application (Microstrategy version 8.01).  The intent of this purchase was to help the FBI centrally manage its business and management data and to present it in a fashion for managers and executives to act upon.  To date, the FBI has been successful in utilizing Microstrategy within the development of its COMPASS capability.  COMPASS is an operational capability that is a management information tool for managers and executives.  COMPASS takes data from existing or legacy applications, and consolidates it within the COMPASS data warehouse.  COMPASS, then based on this data, is able to present reports to users.  The warehousing and reporting functions within COMPASS are primarily derived from the Microstrategy application.  2.2 Government Intention  It has been determined that it would be beneficial to consider taking the COMPASS capability and leveraging the business intelligence aspect of it, Microstrategy, for the entire FBI enterprise.  The FBI wants to maximize its investment and would like to benefit from a single business intelligence platform.  For the purposes of this RFI, business intelligence is being defined as the creation of an IT environment where corporate decisions (down to the tactical level) can be made quickly and easily across various corporate-wide information systems.  Within this BI model, there are the concepts of statistical analysis, on-line analytical processing (OLAP), ad-hoc query and report writing, data warehousing, decision support systems and executive information systems.  Information is extracted from the various disparate corporate information systems, loaded into a data warehouse optimized for analytic processing, and made available to analytical tools that support key management decisions.  The COMPASS capability is primarily comprised of the Microstrategy application, version 8.02, a geospatial mapping tool used for depicting data, and an Oracle database.  FBI would like to leverage best practices and successful implementations of this capability within the enterprise.  It would also benefit from lessons learned and relevant government practices that either should or should not be replicated in attempting this enterprise BI effort.  2.3 Specific Areas in need of Information: When considering responding to the RFI, the scope of the information includes the following topics, respondents are invited to address, to the greatest extent possible, all or a subset of the topics noted below:  1)	An approach for creating and managing an organization that can support distributed development teams, all leveraging the Microstrategy application;  2) An approach and notional plan for scaling to large user base;  3) An approach for sharing data and data management;  4) An approach for architecting a technical approach for implementing a solution;  5)An approach for interfacing to external applications through web services;  6) An approach for administering a business intelligence capability within a multi-level security IT architecture;  7) Identify the benefits and risks associated when considering any approach to deliver a business intelligence capability for an enterprise;  8) An approach for delivering an operational capability and the maintaining the capability;  9)Identification of key roles and responsibilities of individuals or teams within the context of the creation of the capability;  10) Respondents are invited to offer other insights or recommendations that they understand to integral in an effort similar to this one.  3.0 Responses.  3.1 White Paper

<CONTACT>Shanta M Harrison Contracting Officer 3039697224     Shanta_M_Harrison@nbc.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including telephone number, and e-mail address for point of contact) to the procuring office above by 4:00 p.m. MTN time on Tuesday May 22, 2007. The DOI - National Business Center (NBC), Denver has a requirement for QuickTime Support.  The Personnel and Payroll Systems Division, Federal Personnel Payroll systems & Services Directorate, National Business Center, Department of the Interior, is responsible for the development, maintenance, modification, testing, configuration management, production processing, and client support for the computer time & attendance (T&A) application QuickTime. QuickTime consists of three parts - web access, the application, and a database. QuickTime executes in a single or multiple server environment. QuickTime is accessed via a web browser. QuickTime executes on both NT and UNIX operating systems. QuickTime is written in JPL (JPL is a proprietary language of Prolifics, a JYACC company), C, and Java scripts. QuickTime requires the following proprietary software: Panther, Panther/JetNet, and IBM WebSphere. (Panther and Panther/JetNet are propriety products of Prolifics, a JYACC Company; IBM WebSphere is a proprietary product of the IBM Corporation). The contractor will provide technical guidance and oversight, development/programming services, software installation/configuration assistance, performance management assistance (e.g. load and regression testing, performance monitoring and tuning), Federal client assistance, etc. in the further development, implementation, installation, and configuration of subsequent releases of QuickTime.  The NBC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with JYACC, Inc. (Prolifics) for this requirement.  Based on previous market research, the Government believes that Prolifics possesses the necessary capabilities that will satisfy agency requirements, and work in conjunction with certain Oracle applications already in place at the NBC.   Based on the information available at this time, the proprietary nature of the required software, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the support services specified to be available from JYACC, Inc. (Prolifics.)  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if a competitive opportunity exists. Since no solicitation document exists at this time, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS intends to negotiate with the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore MD, a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 ( c ) (1), only one responsible source. It is believed that only this entity can satisfy the agency requirement to provide scientific and technical expertise services for AIRS Cloud Clearing Risk Reduction: alternative Methodologies for Estimation of the Clear State within the AIRS Field-of-Regard for Cloud Clearing. The task will utilize observations from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroraediometer (MODIS) that were launched on May 4, 2002. The University of Maryland has worked with the AIRS rapid Transmittance algorithm for over a decade. The algorithms developed at NOAA by the task manager have utilized the University of Maryland Baltimore County algorithm over the last decade. Existing code and coefficients already exist for all the current operational high spectral resolution instruments including HIRS and AIRS as well as missions such as EUMETSAT?S  IASI and the NPOESS CRIS  instruments. The requirement is to develop the capability to quickly compute MODIS thermal radiance from a geophysical state, develop a RTA for  MODIS thermal channels that have spectral overlapping AIRS  coverage.  The RTA must be compatible with the methodology and spectroscopy developed for the AIRS RTA. Deliverables must provide code and coefficients for a MODIS rapid transmittance algorithm (RTA) for 16 MODIS thermal channels. (MODIS channels 20, 21,22,23,24,25,27,28, 29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36). this procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13,

A long term goal of CNCS is to diversify funding effective fiscal year 2008 with an initial infusion of private sector support that will be expanded in subsequent program years.  The following questions are posed in order for CNCS to determine a reasonable path for evaluating alternative funding structures: 1.What possible approaches (models) should CNCS consider to achieve sustainable and significant infusion of private resources to shift AmeriCorps NCCC toward greater public/private partnership? 2.	What precedent has been set for government programs moving from a public model to a public/private model? a.What are the success stories and challenges? b.What have been the implications on Appropriations? c.What is a reasonable ?balance? or proportion of public/private funding while maintaining the core purpose of the NCCC?  In the short and the long-terms? 3.Are there specific resource development approaches that should be avoided if we want to maintain a strong federal alignment? Organizations responding to this Notice should have significant, demonstrated experience moving publicly funded institutions into a public/private model.  Again, this is not a request for proposal, but rather a request for information to assist in the collection of market research data about the successes and challenges of engaging in this process.  If responses to the above questions exceed 10 pages, only the first 10 pages will be viewed. Background:The National Civilian Community Corps -- strengthens American communities and develops leaders through team-based national and community service. One of our nation's premier national service programs, the NCCC works in partnership with nonprofit and faith-based organizations, schools, and local, state and national agencies.  NCCC creates highly motivated, prescreened, rapidly deployable teams of American citizens trained in first aid, CPR, disaster relief, and firefighting who have responded to every major national disaster since 1994. NCCC teams have led the national service response in the Gulf Coast following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, devoting 65% of its resources to recovery efforts and providing a desperately needed lifeline to devastated individuals, families, and communities. In meeting local, state, and regional priorities, NCCC has earned its reputation as a valued partner in environmental, youth development, housing, and disaster mitigation projects since its inception in 1994. AmeriCorps NCCC has completed more than 6,000 projects and logged nearly 20 million service hours, valued conservatively at $360 million since it was established 13 years ago.  Over 1,000 hard-working members, ages 18-24, serve annually investing nearly two million service hours in communities in every state on service projects that are deemed essential by local communities.  Teams have planted hundreds of thousands of trees, bushes, and seedlings, helped construct or renovate 6,000 homes, constructed or renovated 7,800 miles of hiking trails, tutored or mentored thousands of youth, and assisted hundreds of thousands of citizens in need.  The NCCC?s decentralized, residential, team-based military model and its nimble, ready response capacity are key to its effectiveness.  The NCCC is a critical component of U.S. disaster mitigation, response, relief, and recovery efforts. Teams were on the ground before Katrina hit landfall in August of 2005.  NCCC members, although just 1.5% of the national service membership, completed 50% of the 800,000 service hours in the Gulf Coast that supported the disaster relief and recovery effort in 2006. 
NCCC is the only service program that the Corporation for National and Community Service manages directly.  Its decentralized structure fosters community partnerships and attention to local needs.   Regional bases ensure a membership body that is flexible, fully prepared, and readily deployable in an array of environments and situations. NCCC also serves as a research and development laboratory demonstrating how to effectively engage young adults in high intensity, rigorous domestic service experiences. The ability to track and monitor activities and accomplishments of the services provided and the members who serve provides a rich source of data. Oversight of a highly structured and deployable national service program allows the epicenter for national service to develop and implement programming that tests theories and strategies, and responds immediately to changing priorities.AmeriCorps NCCC is developing civically engaged leaders of tomorrow.From regional residential campuses structured by top-level military leadership, NCCC molds leaders of high performing, cohesive teams who serve in local communities throughout the country.  An intense four week training institute not only prepares members for service but also generates leaders who can effectively manage large numbers of volunteers at any given time.  In 2006, NCCC members coordinated the work of 73,000 total volunteers or 65 volunteers per member.  The NCCC will launch a Public Service Fellows program in 2008 that will provide expanded training and service learning opportunities for select members who want to pursue federal, non-profit and teaching careers.  Implementation of a Summer of Service program for youth ages 14 to 17 in 2007 will expose more youth from disadvantaged circumstances to community service, and meaningful civic engagement and leadership opportunities.The AmeriCorps NCCC program is based on a multi-dimensional commitment to education and American communities.
Through community education and structural modifications, NCCC helps American businesses and communities with preparedness and disaster mitigation. NCCC tutors students in disadvantaged and disaster-affected areas, helping build and rebuild communities.  In partnership with higher education, NCCC provides the opportunity to earn educational credit through service and an educational stipend to graduates, who bring invaluable experience to the academic community.  Through civic education and hands-on service-learning experience, NCCC maximizes corps members? effectiveness and produces exceptional leaders.

<DESC>Subject:  Market Research for the High Capacity Communications Capability (HC3) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Introduction:  The Project Manager, Warfighter Information Network-Tactical  (PM, WIN-T), is conducting Market Research to identify sources to develop a high capacity (Above 2GHz), multi-band, multi-mode terminal using current and future satellites. Scope:  PM, WIN-T is employing an evolutionary approach in the acquisition of the HC3 capabilities.  This approach will develop two increments of capabilities as described in the HC3 Capability Development Document (CDD).  Increment 1 is a Communication at  the Halt (CATH) capability that will replace existing Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminals such as the AN/TSC-85, 93, and the Phoenix terminal.  These HC3 tactical ground terminals will effectively interface with Advanced Extremely High Frequency ( AEHF), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), commercial satellites, and any remaining Defense Satellite Communications Systems (DSCS) satellites.  These terminals will be multi-band (C, X, Ku, Ka, Q), modular, high capacity, and IP-based.  Increment 1 of the HC3 w ill also provide Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities using the XDR waveform and the AEHF satellite Description:  The HC3 provides high capacity, multi-band, multi-mode connectivity using current and future satellites.  HC3 will support wideband and protected ground tactical communications in a Communications At-The-Halt (CATH) configuration, using Defen se Satellite Communications System (DSCS, X-Band), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS, X and Ka-Band), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF, Q-Band), as well as numerous commercial satellites (C, X, and Ku-Band).  Subsequently, HC3 will upgrade its CATH termin al and WIN-T Transmission Subsystems with Transformational Satellites (TSATs) higher capacity and protected communications capabilities.  HC3 is a mission critical capability that will bridge the battlefield digital divide by providing unprecedented Wa rfighter access and full reachback capability as a part of the Global Information Grid (GIG) and evolving FORCEnet, LandWarNet and C2 Constellation architectures. Interested sources should respond with a white paper, not to exceed 20 pages, about its products and their ability to satisfy the above described requirements.  All information should be submitted by 4 June 2007 to PM WIN-T,  ATTN:  SFAE-C3T-WIN-BMD (G. DeVeaux)), Murphy Dr, Bldg 913, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5506.

<SUBJECT>B -- Sole Source- Childhood Obesity Modeling Network (COMNet)
<DESC>Background Information:
Models are routinely used to guide public policy decisions in many areas that affect human life and health. Environmental regulations and demographic forecasting are two areas where models have gained stature as policy tools. The purpose of this project is to create a network of modelers who are already active in the area of developing mathematical models to project population outcomes and evaluate the effect of interventions and policies that impact the prevalence of childhood obesity.  

The Childhood Obesity Modeling Network (COMNet) will use the success of another network as its guide: the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET).  CISNET is a consortium of investigators funded by the National Cancer Institute, all of whom have developed models to improve our understanding of the impact of cancer control interventions (e.g., prevention, screening treatment) on population trends in cancer incidence and mortality.  In addition to examining past trends, these models are also used to project future trends in order to project the outcomes associated with various cancer control strategies.  COMNet is the first attempt to our knowledge to develop such a consortium focused on this area.

One of the most important advantages of having a consortium of modelers all working on similar questions is the ability to employ a comparative modeling approach, where a common question is developed and addressed by all models in order to compare results across models.  For these types of collaborations, a set of common inputs is used across all models and a common set of intermediate and final outputs is developed to help understand differences and similarities across models.  Results from comparative modeling studies lend credibility to model results by providing a form of sensitivity analysis on the model assumptions and structure adopted by independent working groups.  Another advantage of a modeling consortium is the ability to share ideas about underlying modeling assumptions, as well as to bring in experts in specific areas to guide the discussions. The success of this type of approach has been shown with CISNET (www.cisnet.cancer.gov).

Purpose:
The main focus of the Network will be to improve a and validate the use of mathematical models to project population outcomes and evaluate the effect of interventions and policies that impact the prevalence of childhood obesity. Most of the focus will be on the United  States experience but we will also draw on experiences and models in other countries (e.g. Australia). We will construct models for the total population, as well as models for subpopulations. For example, we will examine models for males and females. There has been growing concern about growing disparities in rates of obesity in the United States, and we will examine models defined by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic position, and examine their assumptions and applicability. One of the important issues we need to understand is the potential diifferences in longer term outcomes of obesity (e.g. diabetes incidence and overall morbidity, mortality and functional status as it may vary across populations and ecologic settings).  

Scope of Work:

It is the intent of the NIH/ Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research to provide funding to the Harvard School of Public Health in exchange for the products and services described in this noticet. So that this work may be completed in its entirety, additional monies will be provided from other sources.  Harvard will establish and nurture the Childhood Obesity Modeling Network (COMNet). The following tasks will be accomplished under this contract:
?	Confirm members of COMNet
?	Confirm members of an Advisory Group
?	Plan and conduct two face-to-face scientific meetings of members of COMNet in each of FY 2007 and FY2008.  
?	Each of the above scientific meetings will be a working meeting in which the COMNet participants discuss their proposed, in process, and past childhood obesity modeling work with invited scientists, and with the Advisory Group members.  The communication between the COMNet participants and the Advisory Group, invited scientists and others present at the meeting is expected to be two-way, such that the modeling groups with both present their work and receive comments on it.
?	When each of the various modeling groups have accomplished significant pieces of their work (e.g., conceptual mapping, simulations, revision of the models? parameters), these groups will present their work to all attendees at the scientific meetings. 
?	The first meeting will be held June 28-29, 2007 in Boston, MA at the Harvard School of Public Health.  
?	All work funded under this contract (including but not limited to conceptual models, data and parameters on which models are run and tested, simulation results) will belong to the Federal Government and made available to the public via electronic means and will be referred to and announced on NIH and other government websites.

Proposed Content  of Meetings:
Harvard will hold two in-person meetings per year as well as approximately four teleconferences per year for purposes of planning the COMNet meetings and following up on meeting activities. Notes of the in-person meetings will be posted along with presentations of the modeling groups on-line, accessible only to members and advisory board members. We will hold teleconferences with Advisory Board members in-between the in-person meetings to review progress and solicit advice. Advisory Board members are invited (but not required) to attend in-person meetings.

Harvard personnel plan to accomplish several goals at the in-person meetings which will each take place over 1.5 days.  First, each group will present the details of their modeling approach for purposes of enhancing model transparency across groups.  This process will be valuable and should make clear potential differences across model structures and assumptions.  Second a small number of comparative modeling studies for all groups to engage in will be identified.  For example, all models could start with a cohort of children of a specified age and then follow them until adulthood to compare BMI projections under various scenarios (e.g., status quo vs increased energy expenditure scenario). These activities will take place during day one of the meeting. 

The next half day of meeting time will be used for consultations from experts (see below), as well as planning for future meetings and consultants and for development of questions and issues for the Advisory Group.  

A first meeting to take place in Boson on June 28-29, 2007 is already planned. This meeting time has been confirmed by the four modeling groups as well as Dr. Dietz and Dr. Mabry.

Potential COMNet Participants 
COMNet will consist of Consortium Members, as well as members of the Advisory Group.  We will also be meeting with collaborators with expertise to assist in developing and validating the models. 

The COMNet members are all experienced modeling groups that are now actively working to model the obesity epidemic. Recent publications and presentations (Homer et al 2006; Levy et al 2005; Swinburn et al 2006; Wang et al 2006) describe some of the models and approaches that are currently being used. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NIH.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced products and services as specified above.  Responses must be be received by 4PM EDT on May 30, 2007.

<DESC>This notice is being publicized in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101 requiring Contracting Officers to disseminate information for proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000.  Further in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 it is the intent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to make award to the Saul Mineroff Electronics, Inc.  

The intended order will provide for a device that incorporates radio frequency filtering to attenuate interference when recording audio from cellular phones.  The units also incorporate an electret element which requires phantom power from the recorder thus suppling more gain to the audio input of the recorder.  There are no other telephone pick-up devices on the market which can be used in place of this unit.  

As a result Saul Mineroff Electronics, Inc. is the only responsible source to provide the necessary functionality of the required equipment.

<SUBJECT>A -- Airborne Network Technology Review Days
<DESC>Airborne Network Technology Review Days

Announcing the 3rd Annual "Airborne Network Technology Review Days" to be conducted at the Radisson Hotel and Conference Center in Utica, New York on 10 - 12 July 2007; sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome, NY and the Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, MA, with the administrative support of the Erie Canal Chapter (NY) of AFCEA.  The objective of the Review Days is to provide a forum for industry and academia to discuss with government representatives the technologies required for formulation of the deployable airborne network(s).  These Review Days will highlight approaches and current plans by the DoD to deploy airborne networks, with special emphasis this year on the Joint Warfighter supported by an Airborne Network.  Participants will have the opportunity to engage government leaders, researchers and scientists on approaches to solving the obstacles of networking airborne assets, review technology demonstrations, and discuss various experiments and practices.
 
This year's Review Days feature: a) Keynote addresses from the AF Chief of Warfighting Integration, LtGen Michael Peterson; the Director of Operations for DISA, RADM Elizabeth Hight; the Director of C4 for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, VADM Nancy Brown; the Director of DARPA, Dr. Anthony Tether; and the Director of US Army CERDEC, Mr. Gary Martin; b) overviews and technology briefs from the Military Services and OSD on their perspectives for implementing an airborne network, c) technology presentations from government and non-government researchers, including JFCOM, OPNAV, FAA, MITRE, Lincoln Laboratory plus d) two Technology Panel sessions focused on technology challenges to realizing a joint warfighter airborne network.  Posters and demonstrations highlighting some of AFRL and ESC's current technology developments will be available.  Additional Review Days details are available at: http://www.afceaeriecanal.org/ant//.

This year on Wednesday, 11 July, the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, Erie Canal Chapter, is sponsoring the Airborne Network Technology Expo 2007 concurrently with the Review Days.  The purpose of Expo 2007 is to provide industry an opportunity to present their perspectives on advancing airborne network technology and to facilitate discussions among academia, industry and government (military and civilian).  Expo 2007 is structured to provide attending government, industry, and university representatives the opportunity to view industry Exhibits, Poster Boards, PowerPoint presentations and/or PC Demos representing their AN-related technology efforts.  AFCEA's Expo 2007 will be held across the street from the Radisson Conference Center, where the AFRL/ESC Airborne Network Technology Review Days 2007 will be held.  Vendors wishing to reserve exhibit space, please access the Exhibitor Registration and Information Package at http://www.afceaereicanal.org.

<SUBJECT>J -- SOFSA Contract Ceiling Increase
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the intent of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to negotiate, on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, an increase in the contract ceiling on the Contractor Logistics Services contract, USZA22-03-D-0006 in support of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) located in Lexington, Kentucky. Awarded in August 2003, this is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Cost-Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract.  Accordingly, this action will increase the current contract ceiling by $600 million from $1.5 billion to $2.1 billion.  This contract was awarded with a five-year base period and five option years available under award term incentives. The award term years have been removed from the contract. It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to (1) unanticipated high level of support for the global war on terror (GWOT) as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11); and (2) USSOCOM?s mission change based on those events. All work to be performed under the contract is considered to be in accordance with the original performance work statement; however, the GWOT increased the amount of work to be accomplished to an amount not contemplated in the estimated original ceiling price.  As a result of the requirements placed against this contract supporting the GWOT and due to USSOCOM?s mission change, the original established contract ceiling of $1.5 billion is expected to be reached in contract year four.  This increase in the ceiling will secure continued and seamless support of several critical on-going projects at SOFSA, such as on-going aviation fixed and rotary wing production and logistic efforts, while at the same time ensuring sufficient contract ceiling is available for new tasks supporting the USSOCOM mission.  Because the requirements and obligations are approaching the contract ceiling, an early recompetition of the SOFSA effort is necessary.  The planning phases for a competitive solicitation are already underway to replace this contract with a targeted draft request for proposal in October 2007 and a Final Request for Proposal in February 2008.  The contractor is L-3 Communications, Joint Operations Group, contract USZA22-03-D-0006.  The incumbent contractor is the only source available with the expertise to allow for effective and efficient continuation of effort pending award of a competitive follow-on contract.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to the Points of Contact listed below.

<SUBJECT>--Process Capability Control & Improvement (PCCI)
<DESC>THIS NOTICE SUPERSEDES NOTICE USA-SNOTE-070510-002 PUBLISHED ON 10 MAY 07, WHICH IS HEREBY RESCINDED. A Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) joint services team is proposing under an effort to implement a higher level  system for Supplier Quality (SQ) to replace local / non standard clauses used in the procurement of common munitions with a single, integrated clause to be used by all JM&L LCMC. The local / non standard clauses to be replaced are referenced in standard c ontractual language used by Joint Munitions Command (JMC), Rock Island Arsenal and Armaments Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal. For the effort outlined here-in the JMC clause to be replaced is currently referenced as (E S7034) STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL (SPC) (MAR 2006) 52.246-4506 and the ARDEC clause to be replaced is currently referenced as ARDEC 32 - Alternatives to Lot Acceptance Sampling (Including Statistical Process Control (SPC)). There are other tailored, progr am unique variations of these two clauses that are intended to be replaced as well. The new clause is commonly referred to as the Process Capability, Control and Improvement Clause, or simply PCCI clause. The proposed clause will support realization of the  intent of MIL-STD-1916, DOD Preferred Method for Acceptance of Product. The PCCI cl ause is adaptable to item complexity, intended use, quantity being procured, cost and industrial base capability by the selection of key characteristics, processes or oper ations, allowing measured improvement over time and shifting the focus of quality req uirements from detection to prevention. A significant change from prior quality requirements is that objective evidence of process control of key characteristics, process es or operations from the production of a product is a deliverable as part of that products Lot Acceptance Data Package and a requirement for acceptance of that product. PCCI also requires an in-depth review and analysis of the manufacturing process, manuf acturing process risks and identification of methods to monitor and control key chara cteristics, processes and operations. This in-depth effort is to be documented in the form of a Process Control Plan (PCP) and submitted as a contract deliverable and be approved by the Government prior to First Article Acceptance Testing (FAAT) or product ion when an FAAT is not required. PCCI requirements are intended to improve product quality by increasing manufacturing process knowledge and capability and assist in su pplier preparation and submission of requests for acceptance by contractor proposed pro visions. The PCCI clause is currently implemented on one (1) pilot program and it is anticipated that it will be implemented on selected additional pilot programs befor e replacing the previously mentioned local / non standard clauses. Suppliers are encouraged to b ecome familiar with the clause and email questions, comments and feedback on the PCCI requirement to the government POC listed below. Point of Contact Mike Ber ry (973) 724-2833 Email your questions to: michael.james.berry@us.army.mil Additional Information: Link to PCCI Clause and Supplier Presentation online will be available 16 May 07 at the following website under Process Capability, Control and Improvement C lause. http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/solinfo/sow/sow.aspx

<SUBJECT>--Process Capability Control & Improvement (PCCI)
<DESC>THIS NOTICE SUPERSEDES NOTICE USA-SNOTE-070510-002 PUBLISHED ON 10 MAY 07, WHICH IS HEREBY RESCINDED. A Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) joint services team is proposing under an effort to implement a higher level  system for Supplier Quality (SQ) to replace local / non standard clauses used in the procurement of common munitions with a single, integrated clause to be used by all JM&L LCMC. The local / non standard clauses to be replaced are referenced in standard c ontractual language used by Joint Munitions Command (JMC), Rock Island Arsenal and Armaments Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal. For the effort outlined here-in the JMC clause to be replaced is currently referenced as (E S7034) STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL (SPC) (MAR 2006) 52.246-4506 and the ARDEC clause to be replaced is currently referenced as ARDEC 32 - Alternatives to Lot Acceptance Sampling (Including Statistical Process Control (SPC)). There are other tailored, progr am unique variations of these two clauses that are intended to be replaced as well. The new clause is commonly referred to as the Process Capability, Control and Improvement Clause, or simply PCCI clause. The proposed clause will support realization of the  intent of MIL-STD-1916, DOD Preferred Method for Acceptance of Product. The PCCI cl ause is adaptable to item complexity, intended use, quantity being procured, cost and industrial base capability by the selection of key characteristics, processes or oper ations, allowing measured improvement over time and shifting the focus of quality req uirements from detection to prevention. A significant change from prior quality requirements is that objective evidence of process control of key characteristics, process es or operations from the production of a product is a deliverable as part of that products Lot Acceptance Data Package and a requirement for acceptance of that product. PCCI also requires an in-depth review and analysis of the manufacturing process, manuf acturing process risks and identification of methods to monitor and control key chara cteristics, processes and operations. This in-depth effort is to be documented in the form of a Process Control Plan (PCP) and submitted as a contract deliverable and be approved by the Government prior to First Article Acceptance Testing (FAAT) or product ion when an FAAT is not required. PCCI requirements are intended to improve product quality by increasing manufacturing process knowledge and capability and assist in su pplier preparation and submission of requests for acceptance by contractor proposed pro visions. The PCCI clause is currently implemented on one (1) pilot program and it is anticipated that it will be implemented on selected additional pilot programs befor e replacing the previously mentioned local / non standard clauses. Suppliers are encouraged to b ecome familiar with the clause and email questions, comments and feedback on the PCCI requirement to the government POC listed below. Point of Contact Mike Ber ry (973) 724-2833 Email your questions to: michael.james.berry@us.army.mil Additional Information: Link to PCCI Clause and Supplier Presentation online will be available 16 May 07 at the following website under Process Capability, Control and Improvement C lause. http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/solinfo/sow/sow.aspx

<ZIP>35807-4301

<SUBJECT>--Modification to Extend Ordering Period for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs)
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Energy Savings Performance Contracts which will extend each contract ordering pe riod consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The ESPC program requirements are currently executed via task orders which are placed against thirteen (13) ID/IQ contracts in order to award energy savings projects for Government instal lations and facilities located within the United States.  All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures and were awarded in fiscal year 1997.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in the next 2-3 months.  A s a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on ESPC acquisitions, under NAICS codes 561210 and 541330.  The draft solicitation(s) and pre-solicitation conference for the follow-on acquisitions are anticipated to be released/conducted in early FY08.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Government s intention to modify the current ESPC ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by 1 year.  Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.  The programmatic capacity established at time of award of the  current contracts was established at $3 billion over a (10) year ordering period (one five year base period and one five year option period).  This capacity was established prior to the award of the contracts based on an analysis of  the type of work requ ired, anticipated workload, effects on competition, and the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work.  The remaining capacity for each contract award is adequate to execute the Governments requirements during the extended ordering p eriod.  As a result, the proposed modifications will not increase contract capacity.  The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-97-D-0060 (Ameresco Ser vices, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0062 (Co-Energy, a small business), DACA87-97-D-0063 (Noresco, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0064 (Honeywell, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0065 (Noresco, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0066 (Sempra Energy, a large b usiness), DACA87-97-D-0067 (Ameresco, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0068 (Select Energy, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0069 (Johnson Controls, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0071 (Pepco, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0072 (Xenergy), DACA87-97-D-0073 (Ch evron Texaco, a large business), DACA87-97-D-0074 (Abacus, a small business).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.  The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with th e terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only a limited number of responsible sources and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Unacceptable d elays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior ESPC experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modificat ions after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for compe titive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon re sponses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability Statements submitted should demonstra te the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The statement shall include pricing information which includes profit rate, ove rhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates; business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups; ability to provide all services, equipment, and construction at its own expense and the abi lity to obtain the necessary financial resources for these services at no upfront or lump sum cost to the Government; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed 5 pages in le ngth.  Statements and/or written inquiries may be directed to Mr. Earl Johnson via email at Earl.W.Johnson@hnd01.usace.army.mil.

Description of Work:  The purpose of the procurement is to supply, haul and apply an estimated 100 tons of Polymer Modified Emulsified Asphalt (HFE-90-IS or equivalent) for chip sealing on Forest Road 9702 within the Bend Fort Rock Ranger District on the Deschutes National Forest. (Call for vicinity map). Quotes to include distributor labor. Equipment:  The asphalt distributor shall be so designed, equipped, calibrated, maintained, and operated, that material may be applied uniformly on variable widths of surface up to 16 feet at readily determined and controlled rates from 0.05 to 2.0 gallon per square yard, with uniform pressure and with an allowable variation from any specified rate not to exceed 0.02 gallons per square yard.  Distributor equipment shall include a tachometer, pressure gauges, and an accurate volume measuring device or a calibrated tank.  Distributors shall be equipped with a power unit for the pump and full circulation spray bars that adjust laterally and vertically.  One hour will be allowed for distributor to refill from tanker.  Application:  Material shall be applied in a uniform, continuous spread. The distributor shall be moving forward at proper application speed when the spray bar is opened.  Any skipped areas or deficiencies shall be corrected.  Junction of spearheads shall be carefully made to ensure uniform coverage and smooth-riding surface. The product shall be applied only when the pavement temperature, in the shade, is seventy-five (75) degrees F. steady and rising.  The material shall not be applied when rain is anticipated within twenty-four (24) hours of application, or when weather is overcast or foggy. Contract period will begin June 15, 2007.  Actual contract start date will be negotiated as the weather becomes favorable for application. Contract completion date is August 15, 2007. Shipments:  Individual deliveries will be made by written, telephone, or verbal notice to the Contractor or the Contractors delegated representative, giving the time, place and quantity for delivery. All shipments will be called for by the Government in truck-transport quantities.  Drivers may be subject to a two (2) hour delay for unloading.  Vendor will be reimbursed at the standard demurrage costs for delays in excess of two (2) hours, unless delays are caused by the vendor.  (Vendor to provide the Government with a copy of their standard demurrage rates).  As there is no bulk storage on the Deschutes National Forest, a cancellation notice delivered at least 12 hours prior to scheduled delivery, shall be honored by the vendor.  This requirement is necessary due to conditions beyond our control i.e. weather, fire, breakdowns, and changing work schedules.  If the Government doesn?t give the 12 hour notice and is unable to use the quantity ordered, the Government will negotiate an equitable adjustment with the Contractor using common demurrage practices.  Inspection and Acceptance at Destination:  Inspection and acceptance of the supplies to be furnished hereunder shall be made at destination by the receiving office of consignee shown elsewhere in the contract.  Inspection and Testing Samples:  When each load of product is delivered, the Contractor shall furnish the COR with one copy of the Bill of Lading and a fully executed Certificate of Compliance conforming to the applicable format below.  A separate Certificate of Compliance will not be required if the Standard Bill of Lading contains the essential information required by the Certificate.

Offerors should address each item listed under the three factors, as these items will be the basis for best value determination for award.  All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined, shall be equal to price.  However, trade-offs among cost or price and non-cost factors shall allow the Government to accept best value.  The Government may issue orders to other than the lowest quote, waive minor informalities or irregularities in quotes received or elect to not award at all. The Government may issue an order on the basis of quotes as received, without entering into discussions with any Quoters.  Therefore, each initial quote should contain the Quoters best terms.

The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

(a) To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to Pub. L. 109-218, part of the Stafford Act, contracting officers may set-aside solicitations to allow only offerors residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by such major disaster or emergency to compete (see Subpart 26.2). (b) No separate justification or determination and findings are required under this part to set-aside a contract action. The set-aside shall be based on a specific geographic area, within a Presidential declaration(s) of disaster or emergency. 6.603 Use of procedures other than set-aside. When implementing the Stafford Act preference by using procedures other than a set-aside under section 6.602, the requirements for a justification to support the use of this authority are in 6.303. These procurements qualify as other than full and open competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for an ELECTRIC CAR FEASIBILITY STUDY detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW) below: STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  Electric Car Feasibility Study A.	BACKGROUND The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) leases approximately 1300 vehicles from General Services Administration (GSA). These consist of both general purpose and special purpose vehicles including sedans, pickup trucks, vans, buses, tractor trailer rigs, ambulances, and law enforcement vehicles.  These vehicles are primarily used in the Launch Complex 39 area, Industrial area, and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) to support payload, Shuttle, and expendable launch vehicle operations. KSC is currently exploring ways to reduce the fleet as well as respond to Executive Order 13423 that requires the Agency to reduce the consumption of petroleum. One option is to integrate the use of battery powered electric vehicles (BPEV) into the overall transportation strategy.  The geographic considerations and the variety in use are major factors in determining the appropriate size and placement of the electric cars.  Recognizing that electric cars have limited range and require strategically placed recharge stations, it is important that these factors be analyzed and applied to KSCs situation. In addition, KSC does not currently have an infrastructure that readily supports the technology or maintenance requirements associated with electric cars.    Therefore, KSC is considering ways to cost effectively optimize the use of electric vehicles in replacement of gasoline vehicles in the KSC vehicle fleet. This will help the center to move closer to meeting the Executive Order. B.	OBJECTIVES The contractor shall:      1. Develop a short term strategy to incorporate a small fleet of battery powered electric vehicles (BPEV) into the KSC vehicle fleet as a demonstration project.  Include recommendation for fleet size.      2. Develop a long term strategy that optimizes (number and type) the use of electric cars in the KSC fleet.      3. Recommend a Center-wide infrastructure for charging stations, to include photovoltaic charging.      4. Recommend car maintenance and support infrastructure.   C.  SCOPE OF WORK The study contractor shall include the following in their analysis:       1.   Determine the types of cars required, their manufacturer(s) and availability        a. Compare reliability considering type and manufacturer        b. Determine manufacturers ability to provide vehicles and long-term sustained technical and logistics support       2. Define maintenance options and associated cost         a. Compare major maintenance locations (or a combination) 	 i. On-site - maintenance contractor comes on site vs. on site contractor 	ii. Off-site  commercial sites outside boundaries of KSC        b. Consider turn around times for each car type and impact to service        c. Define the type and frequency of routine and major maintenance actions      3. Determine the KSC infrastructure needed to support the recommended options and the placement strategy       4. Perform a comparative analysis considering manufacture claims and actual vehicle range between charges (KWH/mile)       5. Establish a utilization strategy, considering:         a. Operational requirements of vehicles and organizations        b. Vehicle range (distances)        c. Recharging stations        d. Optimum distance per charge per vehicle type        e. Maximum speed        f. Passenger capacity         g. Strategic placement of cars in certain locations         h. Recommended short term and long term start up fleet size       6. Compare vehicle safety ratings      7. Identify environmental benefits such as reduction in emissions per mile when compared to a similar gasoline powered car.      8. Perform a business analysis to address capital investment, life cycle costs, and payback projections compared to using gasoline powered vehicles       9. Calculate the cost per mile      10.Calculate the yearly operating cost  for electric vehicle (cost per year, based on a five year period)      11.Compare the yearly operating cost of an electric vehicle to a similar gasoline vehicle (based on a five year period) D.  CHANGE MANAGEMENT Any changes to the scope of work or deliverables of the contract must be submitted in writing by the study contractor and approved by the Contracting Officer. E.  DELIVERABLES AND SCHEDULE The contractor shall document and provide the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) the following deliverables:       1. Mid- term  narrative and presentation report to include:          a. Study status        b. Issues and concerns        c. Cost, budget, and schedule updates      2. Final report  narrative and presentation report to include:        a. Overall study results and conclusions         b. Recommendations for short term and long term implementation        c. Recommendations for potential future study All deliverables shall be submitted on a Microsoft Office format CD. The deliverables identified in this effort shall be clear, concise, accurate, and submitted in accordance with the established timeline.	This study contract is short in duration, therefore frequent and clear email and phone communication is imperative and encouraged. F.  APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY The contractor shall determine the data requirements and the methodology to successfully execute this SOW.  The contractor shall interface with the COTR to address interface issues beyond the contractors control. G.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.
_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
SCOPE
This effort is to provide acquisition support services to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  Contractor personnel shall not perform inherently Governmental activities.  The Government contemplates a single award for one (1) full-time position for a four and one-half (4.5) month base period and a one (1) option, not to exceed one (1)year, for either one (1) full-time position or one (1) part-time position.
The Contracts and Procurement Section desires to procure the services of a Senior Contract Specialist for acquisition support.  The Contract Specialist shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.
OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this statement of work is to provide acquisition support services to the NLRB?s Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC.  Specifically, the Contractor shall provide experienced and qualified expertise, on a level that is equivalent to DAWIA level II or III, to provide the acquisition support and assistance identified in the statement of work.  The Contractor shall perform support services for contract execution and administration of various types of contractual vehicles, ranging in complexity from simplified acquisition to formal source selection and contract close-outs.  Work assignments shall be made with the expectation that the Contract Specialist will be able to complete assignments independently.
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION
Work for this contract will be performed at the NLRB?s 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC office.  The Government expects the benefit of Government Site Rates for personnel working on a Government site, where the Government provides office space and normal business facilities for use by Contractor personnel.
Contractor personnel are expected to conform to the Government client?s normal hours of operation.  Normal hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with the core hours from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  During the base period, the Contractor is expected to work eight (8) hours a day, Monday through Friday, during the core hours.  A contractor is expected to be on-site every day, for the full eight (8) hours.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to report, a backup contractor shall report.  In the event the on-site contractor is unable to provide a full eight (8) hours of service, in any given day, the hours must be made up prior to the end of the monthly invoice cycle.
During the option period, the Contractor is expected to work a minimum of three (3) days a week.  Hours per week will be determined at exercise of option.  Additional hours may be required during surge periods.  
The NLRB will be closed on the following Federal Holidays:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, President?s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
This effort will consist of a four and one-half (4.5) month base period and a one (1) year option.  The estimated start date for the base period will be 21 May 2007.  The option period, if exercised, would begin on October 1, 2007.

4) EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:  These scenarios have been provided as examples of the types of situations that a given portable GSM Network System would be expected to perform in a field like environment.

SCENARIO 1. During a hurricane the local communication system has been knocked out.  The portable GSM Network System is connected to an antenna  and maybe a power amp to provide for larger coverage. This system would automatically connect to the current GSM system.  All the designated military & government phones are accepted by the portable system.

SCENARIO 2. Once control over the area/phones (local or host nation personnel) is gained, the system must be able to decipher, ID, and accept/setup only those lines that are working within the approved system. Numbers identified as NOT being listed as an approved must be rejected and not allowed to connect to the system.  Rejected numbers can be re-routed to another GSM service provider or remain out of service until local services are available.  Note- approved users must know the prefix for dialing or be authorized by the system controller to gain access to the system.

SCENARIO 3. The portable GSM Network System must have the ability to send messages/internal codes to all designated personnel phones connected to system simultaneously.
  
SCENARIO 4. The system must have the ability to control designated GSM phones and have upgrade capabilities to provide for GSM / CDMA services at a later date.  Also the system must have the ability to control phones (whether designated or not) in the immediate area by activating/de-activating the system.  Therefore limiting the ability to receive or make any calls until a secure network has been established. 
 
SCENARIO 5. The system must have the ability to work with General Dynamic SME PDA equipment, providing SBU/SIPRNET data and voice capabilities.  The system must also be able to connect to the Deployment TACLAN to send and receive voice / data if necessary.

Application:  Material shall be applied in a uniform, continuous spread. The distributor shall be moving forward at proper application speed when the spray bar is opened.  Any skipped areas or deficiencies shall be corrected.  Junction of spearheads shall be carefully made to ensure uniform coverage and smooth-riding surface. The product shall be applied only when the pavement temperature, in the shade, is seventy-five (75) degrees F. steady and rising.  The material shall not be applied when rain is anticipated within twenty-four (24) hours of application, or when weather is overcast or foggy. Contract period will begin June 15, 2007.  Actual contract start date will be negotiated as the weather becomes favorable for application. Contract completion date is August 15, 2007.

HFE-90-IS or Equal - Performance Characteristics of Emulsified Asphalt:
The asphalt must be polymerized anionic type emulsified asphalt designed for seal coats.  The emulsion must be classified as a high-float with medium setting characteristics.  The asphalt is required to be polymerized prior to emulsification.  The emulsion will be designed for environments having extreme daily temperature variations and in the use of unwashed aggregate for the seal coat.

Specification for Anionic, High-float Polymerized Asphalt Emulsion:  
This specification has been designed to yield a set of distinguishing characteristics for a polymer modified emulsion.  The binder is not  a conventional asphalt cement.  Efforts have been taken to use as many recognized tests as possible, yet demonstrate the materials unique properties.

The asphalt must be polymerized prior to emulsification.  The emulsion can be classified as a high-float, medium setting, anionic-type emulsion for seal coat. 

TEST ? Viscosity at 122 degrees, SSF, minimum 50 plus.  Storage Stability, 1 day.  The material after setting undistributed for 24 hours shall show no white milky separation, but shall be homogeneous throughout, maximum of 1.0.  Sieve Test, 0.1 percent.  Demulsibility, 0.02 N CaCl2, minimum 20 percent.  Asphalt Content by Distillation at 400 degrees, (1) minimum 65 percent.  Oil in Distillate by Volume, maximum of 3.0 percent.

<DESC>This is an Amendment to Solicitation number SA13017RP0011. This Amendment is to answer questions received on this solicitation.


1.	Who is the current contractor providing these services and how long have they been performing on the current contract?
      ANSWER:  This is a new contract. No previous provider. 	
2.	Would the government accept substitution of experience translating relevant subject matter in lieu of a law degree? Given that the government wants a quote by May 18, the requirement that translator must have a law degree from an English speaking country and/or law degree from an Arabic speaking country preferred seems to restrict competition and does not give other contractors sufficient time or a fair chance to find the right candidate. 
 ANSWER:  The RFP states in 6.1.c that the vendor "Must have a law degree from an English speaking country and/or law degree from an Arabic speaking country preferred but not required." and in 6.2.b. that the vendor "Law degree from Arabic speaking country and/or law degree from English speaking country preferred but not required."  
3.	What types of files will we receive? i.e. will we receive editable MS Word documents, PDF files, hard copies, InDesign files, etc.?  ANSWER:  All of the above are possible formats.
4.	What type of formatting will be required for the target documents?  i.e. will we have to provide graphic design services, formatting, layout, etc.?  ANSWER:  The documents will most often need to translated in the same existing format using the existing template, i.e. power points provided in English will be translated to Arabic power points, we do not anticipate the need for high end graphic design services.
5.    Are there any graphics, pictures, charts, etc. included in the documents to be translated?  
	ANSWER:  Charts are very possible, graphics are less likely.
6.   May we see a sample of the work to be translated?  ANSWER:  You may find an example at the following link: http://www.iraqdevelopmentprogram.org/images/tools/iraqoillaw.pdf
