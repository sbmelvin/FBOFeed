<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting a Full and Open competition to acquire the services of qualified U.S. Contractors to provide services to support vocational and technical training in general, and employment services in Iraq, specifically.  In response to Iraq’s high unemployment rate, USAID/Iraq will procure technical assistance to help the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) implement a broad scale workforce development initiative.  The Contractor, using experienced personnel, will assist, in coordination with USAID, the Coalition Provisional Authority, and MOLSA, with the  implementation of  a two-year base contract (with two one-year option periods) to establish and operate 17 vocational and technical training centers and 28 employment centers throughout Iraq.  Prior to developing a work plan to establish these centers, the Contractor will conduct a rapid labor market study throughout Iraq that will compare vocational and technical skills needed by the local private sector with the existing skills and abilities of the local workforce.  Such an analysis will enable the contractor to develop vocational training programs tailored for local private sector needs that bridge the skills gap.  The contractor will also provide necessary training to MOLSA staff to ensure a smooth transition of the centers operation from the Contractor to MOLSA before the end of the contract.

The period of performance for this contract is estimated to be two (2) years from the date of award of the contract.  NAIC:   611 Education Services.

The preferred method of distributing the USAID Procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about April 2, 2004.  It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error(s) resulting from downloading.  All correspondence regarding this notice must be submitted in writing.

<DESC>The FAA has a continuing requirement for repair and engineering support services in support of the AWOS.  The AWOS measures various weather parameters, processes the information and then disseminates the weather data to air traffic controllers via direct ground-to-air broadcasts (and other systems via phone lines).  The weather data is used to direct general aviation traffic. The proposed contract is for a base year with option provisions to renew for four additional one-year periods.  These repair services are only known to be available from All Weather Inc., formerly Qualimetrics Inc., because they hold the data rights and repair specifications for software and specific hardware items such as the ceilometer.  The FAA does not have available complete technical documentation to allow other sources to repair and support this system.   To receive consideration as a potential repair source, any other concern must provide in writing a complete set of system specification drawings, all required standards and testing specifications, test plans/procedures, and part lists.  Documentation must clearly demonstrate that the concern has ownership or legal access to required original equipment manufacturer documentation, equipment listings applicable to the AWOS as well as replacement parts necessary to affect the repairs.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable. Vendors must respond directly to the contracting officer identified in the market survey.  Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey File #76-59108, to arrive by March 31, 2004.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Sole Source extension to SAIC contract NAMA-01-C-0005. The purpose of this acquisition is to extend Contract NAMA-01-C-0005 awarded in June 2001 by one year with an additional one year option in order to provide continued Contractor support to the Interagency Working Group (IWG). Authorized by the Nazi war Crimes Disclosure act of 1998 (PL 105-246) and established by President Clinton on January 11, 1999, the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group (IWG) had a mission to locate, inventory, recommend for declassification and expedite the release of relevant records. On December 6, 2000, Congress extended the life of the IWG through passage of the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act (PL 106-567).  This new Act renamed the group the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Working Group and expanded its mandate to include declassification of records related to Japanese war crimes as part of its mandate.  The Act extended the life of the IWG for 3 years. In January 2004, Congress extended the term of the IWG for a year.  The requirements for support services are growing, particularly in the Japanese area with an identified need for at least one more expert historian in the Far Eastern war crimes area.  The goal is to more completely cover the records relating to Japanese war crimes with the ultimate product of an additional published volume devoted solely to the Far Eastern part of the history.  There may also be more records released on the Nazi phase of war crimes and, if so, these will need review and analysis.  Consequently, there is a need for Contractor support services beyond the term of the current contract. The contract modification will be issued on or about March 31, 2004. This requirement is determined to be available from only one source because of the very steep learning curve for the very unique services provided. Questions concerning this requirement may be directed to Brigette Stewart at 301-837-3229.

The engine is expected to be a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) 2,500 shaft horsepower turbine engine with Civil Certification or Military Qualification that will drop in the current airframe with minimal mo dification to the structure.  Key characteristics of the new engine include:  (1) improved power reserves over current engines, (2) providing for mission power requirements in hot weather at high altitude, (3) improved fuel economy over current engines, (4 ) engines and accessories shall be modular, fault tolerant and capable of accepting future upgrades, and (5) minimal maintenance requirements.  Under the basic contract the selected contractor shall deliver one engine mockup, 8 instrumented flight test eng ines, and 58 production engines.  Additionally, this procurement includes the non-recurring engineering (NRE) for the MH-60 specific modifications, test validation, aircraft integration, flight test support, flight test logistics support, publication sourc e data, and training.  Included in the contract will be options for 56 production engines in FY07, 64 production engines in FY08, spare parts and support (including technical representatives), special tooling, and flight test engine refurbishment.

The two manufacturers are General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE), 1000 Western Ave., Lynn, M A 01910 and Rolls Royce Corporation (RRC), 2001 S. Tibbs Ave., Indianapolis,  IN 46241.  Therefore, this solicitation will be issued based on limited competition between these two sources.

This commercial item procurement will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded using FAR Part 15 procedures.  A pre-proposal conference will be conducted approximately one week after the RF P is issued.  The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors specified elsewhere in the solicitation, considered.  This requi rement is classified under NAICS code 336412.  Responsible sources may request a copy of the solicitation by contacting Ms. Valerie Arthur at varthur@aatd.eustis.army.mil or 757-878-3306.

<ARCHDATE>05162004
<CONTACT>Cuc Tran, Contract Specialist  562-626-7139
<DESC>This specification sets forth the requirements for camera mount for the Weapons Impact Scoring Set (WISS).  WISS is an electro-optical bomb scoring system which uses video cameras, precisely pointed at a target area, to score the practice bombs of Navy aircraft. The camera mount will be used to precisely aim, or orient WISS cameras upon the target areas(s).  The WISS camera shall mount on top of the camera mount that shall in turn be mounted to various supporting structures. 	Additionally, the camera mount shall be mounted within certain environmental enclosures used with WISS when the cameras are mounted outdoors.  This variation of hardware to which the camera mount attaches drives the size maximums set forth below. 2.0     APPLICABLE STANDARDS 2.1     The camera mount must strictly conform to the following standard: 2.1.1  Federal Standard 595B -- Color used in Govern ment Procurement. 3.0      REQUIREMENTS 3.1      OVERVIEW 	The camera mount shall provide three axes rotational adjustment of azimuth, elevation and horizon.  Azimuth is the horizontal adjustment, and elevation is the vertical adjustment of the camera. Horizon is defined as rotation about the long axis of the camera, otherwise known the cameras’ optical axis.  Horizon adjustment, therefore effects the “leveling” adjustment on the horizon of image obtained by video camera. 3.2      MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS 3.2.1   The camera mount shall have a capability of adjusting each axis independently -- One axis can be adjusted without any effect to the other two axes.  Each axis shall have reference tick marks that will let the operator know the angle and the direction of the cameras.  The resolution of the tick markers shall be +/- degree. 3.2.1.1    The azimuth shal l have a minimum adjustment of +/- 10 degrees. 3.2.1.2    The elevation shall have a minimum adjustment of +/- 15 degrees. 3.2.1.3    The horizon shall have a minimum adjustment of +/- 3 degrees. 3.2.2       The angular adjustment, mentioned above, shall be accomplished entirely by hand manipulation, without resorting to tools.  The adjustability movement shall meet the fineness adjustment mentioned below. 3.2.2.1    The minimum angular adjustment, also known as the fineness adjustment, of all three axes shall enable repeatable movements as small as angles defined by tangents of one part in two thousand (1/2000), which is approximately equivalent to 0.025 degrees. 3.2.2.2    The “Repeatable movements” mentioned above is defined as movement that can be made repetitively by a camera mount operator, exercising the utmost care in applying the minimum forces required  to effect the minimum possible movement of the adjusting surfaces (knobs, levels, etc.) -- during hand adjustment operations. 3.2.3       The adjusting knobs (and/or other controlling devices) shall be accessed from the back third of the camera mount (the back of the camera mount correlates with the back of a camera positioned upon it). 3.2.3.1    If knobs are being  used as controlling devices, the knobs shall have a uniform thickness not less than 0.25 inch, and not more the 0.375 inch.  The adjusting knobs shall not exceed more than four (4). 3.2.4       The mechanics of the camera mount shall be constructed sufficiently “tight”.  The “play” shall be minimized to permit adjustment to the above stated fineness, without movement in excess of that fineness criteria prior to final lock down.  There shall be no looseness allowed within the structures of the camera mount  when it’s locked. 3.2.5      The lock down mechanism shall be provided for these two reasons:  First, to preserve the final desired aimed position.  Second, to inhibit blunder adjustments by requiring a subsequent camera mount adjustor to consciously remove adjustment lock down prior to readjustment. 3.2.5.1   The camera mount shall have independent locking mechanism for each axis.  This locking mechanism shall disable the adjustment of particular axis by any means -- unwanted adjustment, vibrations, etc. 3.2.5.2   The locking mechanism shall be accomplished by a simple tool (Allen wrenches, etc.).  The tool shall be attached within the camera mount and be readily available. 3.2.5.3   When the camera mount is locked, the lock down mechanism shall maintain the final adjustment of all three axes when exposed to shocks and vibrations normally expected within a WISS tow er. 3.3          PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC 3.3.1       The camera mount, in order to accommodate the limited spaces upon the WISS camera racks and the environmental enclosures, shall not exceed an overall dimension of 7 inches longs by 4.25 inches wide by 3.0 inches high (7.00”L X 4.25”W x 3.00”H). 3.3.2       The camera mount shall have a removable camera mounting plate that affixes to the under side of the WISS cameras with countersunk bolts.  This plate shall have maximum dimensions of 7 inches long by 3.5 inches wide (7.00”L X 3.5”W). 3.3.2.1    The camera mounting plate, once bolted to a camera of choice, shall enable the quick mount and dismount of the camera from the body of the camera mount.  The camera mounting plate shall be removed, along with its affixed camera, from the top of the camera mount. 3.3.2.2    The camera mount shall include a “hold down mec hanism” for securely holding the camera mounting plate and attached camera to its top surface.  This “hold down mechanism” shall be engaged and disengaged solely with hand manipulation and without resort to tools. 3.3.2.2.1  This mechanism, once engaged, shall prohibit all movement of the camera mounting plate relatively to the body of the camera mount.  It shall maintain its hold when exposed to vibration. 3.3.2.3     The camera mounting plate shall be reversible.  This means the front of the plate can be placed on the back or vice versa. 3.3.2.4     The camera mounting plate’s hole pattern for the camera shall be specified to the contractor during the duration of the contract. 3.3.3        The base plate shall have maximum dimension of 7 inches long by 4.25 inches wide (7.00”L X 4.25”W) 3.3.3.1     It shall have four countersunk holes with a minor diameter of 0 .25 inch.  The hole pattern shall comply with figure 1.  Figure 1.  Base Plate Hole Pattern - FOR COPY OF FIGURE 1, CONTACT CUC TRAN 562-626-7139  3.3.3.2     The base plate holes shall be accessible when the camera mount is set to 0 degrees in all axis’s.  This means the operator can put the bolts and tighten them without any angular adjustment 3.3.3.3     The contractor shall provide the nuts and bolts necessary to attach the camera mount to the existing angle bracket that has 3/8 inch thickness, and the bolts for the camera to the mounting plate. 3.3.3.3.1  The bolts for the camera to the mounting plate shall be specified to the contractor during the duration of contract. 3.3.4    The camera mount shall be capable of holding camera that weigh at least seven (7) lbs. 3.3.5    The camera mount shall not contain or require any type of lubrication which may  cause damage to the sensitive electronic component of the camera. 3.3.6    The friction caused by the materials when the camera mount is being adjusted shall not affect the fineness adjustment mentioned above and the capabilities of the camera mount. 3.3.7    The color of the camera mount shall comply according to the Federal Standard 595B with color identification 27038 (black). 3.3.8  The finish shall be hard anodized. 4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS 4.1  The camera mount shall be corrosion resistant.  It shall be constructed of aluminum, stainless steel and /or other materials that are resistant to moisture and salt brine air corrosion.  Resistance to galvanic corrosion by dissimilar materials is also required. 4.2  The camera mount shall sustain without any degradation of performance to the following environmental condition: 		Temperature:   -10 degree C  to 50 degree C. 		Humidity: 0 to 95% relative humidity, non-condensing

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Chunyan Liu, Department of Planning & Finance, State Environmental Protection Administration, 115 Xizhimennei Nanxiaojie, Beijing  100035, People’s Republic of China, Phone:  (8610) 67112251 / (8610) 67117995.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Suzhou Central Hazardous Waste Management Facility.

With the recent SARS experience as a strong motivation, State Environmental Protection Agency of China (SEPA) issued draft regulations and standards on medical waste management, transport and incineration in June 2003 and final standards for hazardous waste (HW) incineration and secure landfilling in 2002.  To facilitate meeting these various obligations, SEPA and the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning have drafted a National Hazardous Waste Management Plan (NHWMP) new hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs) over the next 2-3 years so that every industrialized area will have its own regional comprehensive hazardous waste management facilities with the most advanced areas developing additional TSDFs.  In addition, medical waste treatment centers, most involving incineration, will be developed around the country at the city and county levels.  

Of the 31 cities to receive new hazardous and medical waste TSDFs, Suzhou is among the 8 cities selected to serve as national demonstration centers for the rest of the country. A United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) grant was signed with the Suzhou Environmental Engineering Company (EEC), in partnership with the Suzhou Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), to partially fund a feasibility study focused developing a new hazardous waste TSDF.  Suzhou wants to develop a minimum number of new centralized TSDFs according to a unified plan and thus be able to standardize waste management and emphasize specialized treatment capabilities.  Suzhou Solid Wastes Treatment and Disposal Center is planned to be the first such regional HW TSDF.  The local planning commission has approved the proposal which is now being reviewed by the national State Planning Council.  
 

The feasibility study will facilitate the introduction of U.S. HW recycling, solidification/stabilization, secure landfill and rotary kiln incineration consulting/engineering, technology/equipment, and O&M/owner possibilities to Suzhou for this project and future projects elsewhere in China that these HWMF developers may take on.  The study could result in $71.5 million in U.S. exports.  The study will conduct:  1) Technical Analysis; 2) Economic Analysis; 3) Financial Analysis; 4) Environmental Analysis including a preliminary environmental assessment of proposed project options; 5) Review of Regulatory Issues relating to hazardous wastes; 6) Proposal and identification of equipment for project implementation from prospective U.S. sources of supply and coordinate contact between Dadi and U.S. equipment sources; 7) Development of implementation plan comprised of a master plan and an action plan; and 8) Submission of Final Report. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $284,364 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, U.S. TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

 
Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon, April 19, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Department of State, Office of Acquisitions, intends to award a sole source modification to increase the ceiling on contract S-LMAQM-00-D-0027 awarded to DynCorp International under full and open competition.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the incumbent contractor under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for worldwide personal protective services.  The job positions require extensive pre-deployment training and historical knowledge of the operating location/procedures.  The ceiling will be increased from $114M to approximately $387.2M in order to continue current operations within the scope of the statement of work.  A sudden increase in worldwide security requirements caused the original ceiling to become inadequate.  The government anticipates a full and open solicitation for these requirements to be issued in the April - May timeframe.  A draft RFP was FEDBIZOPPS posted on March 4, 2004 for public comment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest in this action by email to the Contracting Officer, Raymond Bouford, at BoufordRW@state.gov by 4PM on April 16, 2004.  No telephone calls will be returned due to workload.

The Forest Service, in coordination with the Department of the Interior (including at least the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation), and the US Army Corps of Engineers, has a need for a national, consolidated, reservation service contract in support of the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) Program.

Incumbent contractors include Spherix, Inc. for the National Park Reservation Service (NPRS) and ReserveAmerica, Inc. for the current NRRS.

In accordance with this acquisition process, the Project Agreement will serve as the initial solicitation document.

An Industry Day is scheduled for December 11, 2003, however, definitive information on the Industry Day will be contained within the Project agreement.  This acquisition will be awarded under NAICS Code 561599 based on full and open competition. This acquisition will be conducted using a streamlined acquisition process intended to provide an improved acquisition environment intended to benefit both the vendor community and the Government.  To be eligible for award, interested parties must respond to the Project Agreement in order to be considered for the Statement of Need and subsequent award of any resulting contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Scope of Work

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for the study, evaluation, review, technical investigation and analysis of current and emerging knowledge and technology in selected areas of food processing, food safety, food security, and human health issues.  Three kinds of analysis/reviews shall be requested under the terms of this contract:  Comprehensive Reviews, Abbreviated Reviews, and Technical Investigation and Analysis for Potential Solutions.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for providing comprehensive reviews in the subject scientific areas and shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  The approach selected to address the topics identified by FDA for each Comprehensive Review shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information.  The final reports shall carefully document divergent scientific opinions.  The contractor shall prepare, within sixty days of initiation of each Comprehensive Review, a detailed Scientific Plan that describes a reasonable approach to address the scientific questions posed by FDA.  This plan shall take into account the complexities of the issues raised.  A project schedule shall be included in the Plan to indicate how the contractor shall organize the work to be performed for each Comprehensive Review.  In addition some abbreviated reviews are anticipated requiring rapid response and analysis and summaries of emerging issues in selected topics.   Abbreviated Reviews are intended to provide FDA with rapid analysis and summaries of emerging issues in the areas of food safety and health; they are normally completed within one to six months.  Requests for Abbreviated Reviews of selected topics shall be interspersed during the life of the contract.  The contractor shall prepare a written report summarizing the review and the conclusions or recommendations reached.  The basic types of Abbreviated Review activities that may be requested by FDA:  “Quick Response Actions on Request” shall address specific scientific issues such as the scientific merit of research proposals, new research, food processing and technological developments, and food safety and security concerns.  Predictive Response shall provide perspectives on issues in the field of food safety and security for approaching scientific areas of science evaluation, which are relevant to FDA’s mission.  Technical investigation and analysis of potential solutions to specific food safety or food security issues shall be requested under the terms of this contract.  These investigations involve a review of the food processing systems and activities and determination and validation of the preventive measures that can be applied by industry, particularly small and medium business, to eliminate or minimize a food safety hazard or food security vulnerability.  The contractor must have state-of-the-art knowledge on relevant scientific issues relating to food processing, food safety, food security, and human health.  The contractor must have a multidisciplinary scientific based organization that has experience and sufficient scientific expertise necessary to conduct research in the areas mentioned above.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID/IQ multi-year contract with task orders.   Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.   Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research it will be necessary to classify these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the ability to obtain the necessary security clearances if they receive the contract.  Technical questions should be sent to the Contract Specialists e-mail address or fax number contained herein.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to F7335440680100 is replace the previously posted description with the description cited below.

Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Technology Days 2004 at Scott AFB, IL 5-6 May 2004.  The objective of this meeting is to provide a forum for industry and research conduits to present maturing technologies that can be rapidly fielded.  Our focus will be on available technology solutions to support warfighter’s operational capabilities.  Our sight picture is to examine the technologies ready for transition within the next eight years, with focus reflected in the following topic areas:  

·	Force Projection 
o	Aircraft Survivability 
o	Air Refueling 
o	Precision Airdrop 
o	Autonomous All-Weather Landing
·	Base Opening 
o	Force Protection
o	Operations Support in Austere Environments
·	Information Superiority 
o	Secure, Global Connectivity and Information Technology

Additional details for each topic area are explained on attachment 1.  The primary medium for this forum are the briefing sessions.
Each day we’ll have briefing sessions, one hour session per group (four in the morning and four in the afternoon).  The nominal breakdown for each of the sessions is:
Brief - 40 minutes
Q&A - 10 minutes
Break - 10 minutes.  

The briefings will be held on the 3rd floor of Bldg 1700, in the McClellan Conference facility. The audience attendance will be limited to military, civilian government officials, and government contracted subject matter experts with signed non-disclosure statements so briefings can be open to proprietary only discussions. The McClellan Conference facility has space for 150 people and can be divided into two rooms. Using the briefing session scheme described above, there are 16 time slots with the potential for up to 32 if the conference room is divided and simultaneous briefings held. This all depends on the response from this call for briefings. In addition to the briefing sessions, tabletop/pop-up exhibit/display tables and an ice breaker will be at the Scott Club. 
On May 5, the Scott Club will be available for limited tabletop/pop-up displays and exhibits for interested staff officers and leadership. The hope is to provide an opportunity for AMC staff to interact with industry and lab representatives on a one-on-one basis. Also, after the May 5 briefing sessions, there will be an ice-breaker at the Scott Club to further provide opportunity for interaction. Due to limited space and power availability, there is only room for 20 exhibits tables and limited poster board presentations (expect 8’X2’ tables). Updated information regarding layout of the club will be provided through email. 
If you intend to brief/exhibit/demonstrate a technology, send exhibit requirements (to include space and power) and a two-page executive summary/abstract to us no later than March 31. Due to the limited time slots available, a selection process will be applied, if response dictates, based on applicable topic areas. The announcement of final presentation schedule/agenda will be provided by April 7. Final presentations for those selected are required by close of business April 21. 
Anyone wishing to present/participate in the conference must submit a registration form no later than April 28. Each presentation group presenting/exhibiting is required to pay a conference fee. The conference fee includes: conference charges, coffee and light refreshments, and the Ice-breaker. Check-In and exhibit booth setup is tentatively scheduled to take place from 7:30 - 9 a.m., May 5. Tear-down of exhibits is required after the ice-breaker. The use of cameras or audio/visual recorders is strictly prohibited throughout the conference except during the ice-breaker. Export and import licenses, taxes, and/or shipping for any exhibit are the responsibility of the person(s) providing it. We hope you join us in making AMC Technology Days 2004 exciting and stimulating!

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) is preparing for issuance of a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for the subject project.  USITC is soliciting comments from interested parties, in order to help draft a Scope of Work (Draft SOW).  This procurement will be restricted to vendors from GSA’s Schedule.  Your comments will be appreciated and considered as we create the RFQ for the proposed task order.  No information on Pricing, Competition, or Evaluation Criteria is available at this time.  

We would like to ask those responding to this RFI to consider the following issues-

  	1. Is your firm likely to respond to an RFQ of this type when issued? Would representatives of your firm consider meeting with USITC personnel to provide information on this topic prior to issuance of any RFQ?

2. Are there examples that show that combining the entire web presence of an enterprise into a single portal with common look-and-feel features is a recognized business practice that provides tangible value to users? 

3. Are there particular features of a Content Management System (CMS) that would be useful and valuable to the USITC as a tool for creating and managing web content? Are there tangible ways that this value could be recognized and measured?

4. Are there particular features of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and/or a Code Versioning System (CVS) that would be useful and valuable to the USITC as a tool for creating server functions and database access features that support the ITC portal? Are there tangible ways that this value could be recognized and measured?

5. Are there particular features of a control framework that would be useful and valuable to the USITC as a tool for integrating security, new services, and encapsulating legacy systems in support of web content? Are there tangible ways that this value could be recognized and measured?


6. The USITC has prototyped some services using open source software and has been favorably impressed with its reliability and functionality. Are there areas where open source software could lower USITC cost of acquisition without raising the cost of support and operations?

7. Which type of metadata management and website navigation tools are likely to produce the highest level of user satisfaction and productivity for USITC customers? Are there any significant cost trades-offs?

Comments may or may not be incorporated in the Statement of Work.  Comments will be accepted until April 9, 2004, 4:30 p.m. EST.  All comments shall be addressed to Deborah Kearns in writing at (Email preferred: Deborah.kearns@usitc.gov), fax:  202-205-2024, or by mail addressed:  USITC, 500 E Street, SW,  Attn:  Deborah Kearns, Deputy Chief Information Officer for Management, Room 412D, Washington, DC  20436.  Attached is a project overview.  The document is in MS Word and can be made available in WordPerfect.  


1. Project Identification and Scope


Background:

The ITC is reengineering the usitc.gov website into an enterprise portal, designed to reduce print publishing and mailing costs, while providing users with a more coherent tool for accessing information and services provided by the ITC. This project integrates several other previous projects.

The term “ITC enterprise portal architecture” describes the configuration of a set of several ITC systems merged together using tools that make them work as an integrated platform. The new ITC enterprise portal architecture will present a single point of entry for users on the Internet.  The portal tools should consist of centralized resources like those being used by most well run enterprises. 

We envision a phased build-out with Phase I consisting of basic tools like content management, light application service management, and search engine services that will be used to build our first consumer portal.  Initially, a low-impact approach to application integration will consist of simple links to transaction-based web applications, like EDIS and Dataweb.  Additional portal architecture tools, more powerful integration layers, automatic data format translation, interactive collaboration, and other functionality can be added in subsequent phases.

It is planned that the initial ITC portal project focus on content related issues. Thus the initial strategy described in this document will have the following orientation: instead of custom-developed software applications, the ITC portal should be built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products whose features meet all current needs as well as anticipating the future of the ITC web portal.

 

Scope:

The focus of this project is not solely the web redesign effort. Since many other systems must integrate with the web, this section details areas of responsibility that it is desirable to integrate with the Web redesign project. For the consumer portal portion itself, the following domains of responsibility have been identified: the Internet (http://www.usitc.gov,) Intranet (http://intranet/,) and preparation /management of Electronic Publications.

Internet: USITC.GOV & related products

With respect to the internet, the project will focus on reorganizing content on the USITC.GOV Web site, improvement of business processes used to maintain that site, and improvements in the overall aesthetic presentation of the USITC.GOV Web site and other web products.

Project Responsibilities 
•	Improving Web site navigation through usability studies and graphical redesigns.
•	Defining and communicating standards, ensuring the creation of consistent and integrated Web content.
•	Identification and management of Web business processes, including internal controls on content posting and application management.
•	Creating page templates for use by authors.
•	Creating navigation templates, which control the navigational elements to the ITC site.
•	Configuring and maintaining of Web related applications, such as the proposed portal and content management software.
•	Revising future ITC portal structure, designs, and layouts, constantly improving usability and content-posting workflow.
•	Assigning users to groups and giving groups rights to subject-area pages.

Intranet: HTTP://INTRANET/ 

Regarding the intranet, the project will focus on reorganizing all content, improvement of business processes and technologies used to maintain the Intranet, and improvements in the overall aesthetic presentation.

Project Responsibilities 
•	Maintaining and posting content. 
•	Managing all intranet related Web projects for compliance with ITC’s strategic plan, ensuring adherence to the approved Web strategy. 
•	Identifying and managing Intranet business processes, including internal controls on content posting.
•	Creating page templates for use by content authors.
•	Creating navigation templates, which control the navigational elements to the ITC Intranet site.
•	Assigning users to groups, and giving groups rights to subject area content.
 

Electronic Publications

With respect to electronic publications, the project will focus on improvement of business processes used to electronically prepare and disseminate publications.

Project Responsibilities 
•	Working with the appropriate program areas, assessing the feasibility of transforming research content into an information-centric (rather than a publication-centric) information source.
•	Improving the web presentation of publications in a manner that allows visitors to find relevant documents faster and more efficiently than they can now.
•	Identifying and managing business processes relating to document preparation, ensuring that efficient workflows are being used by authors. 

	Enterprise Portal Infrastructure

With respect to the new enterprise portal infrastructure, the project uses the concept of “layers”. This project will focus on development of a presentation layer ,enterprise security layer, and application control layer.

 
Figure 1

The top three layers of the Portal consist of: general displays and access provided by the presentation layer; authentication (that is users logging in, and finding out what they can access) governed by the security layer, and the control layer acting as a traffic cop for managing applications and data retrieval.  

Developing naturally interrelated services like the diagram above, but doing so as independent heterogeneous applications could expose the agency to significant integration risks. Therefore, when building the components of the portal, the ITC will stick closely to a documented standard, which simplifies enterprise applications by basing them on common, modularized components. 

Using a common standard can also supply many details of application behavior automatically, freeing developers from complex programming, and allowing for upgrades of parts or modules of the system later, without breaking the entire system.

Maintainability and scalability are important for ITC’s technical infrastructure’s long-term viability. Re-using proven code can help build applications that operate reliably 24 x 7, enterprise-wide. One term for this type of software recycling is repurposeable resources, which are modules capable of working on many of the various systems. 

Multitier infrastructures like Figure 1 can be hard to architect and are only made more complex if heterogeneous standards and incompatible environments are used by different ITC systems. Doing so would require bringing together a wide variety of development skill-sets and development resources, which is needlessly expensive. 

The USITC will consider only the most widely accepted and well proven standards for integrating corporate web environments, examples being J2EE and .NET. Even with adopting a standard like these for the portal, ITC’s future environment may still include other existing or canned applications that have to integrate services from a variety of vendors with a diverse set of application models and even other standards. Good standards have ways of coping with this situation, like “encapsulation”, which resembles putting an adapter in your cars cigarette lighter so you can plug your cell-phone into it. The new USITC standard must be able to sit on top of a wide range of existing systems – EDIS III, DataWeb, ITC-NET, Library Management System, etc.. – it must create bridges between these systems.

 

2. Procurement Approach

The USITC intends to issue an RFQ which will utilize resources available from pre-competed contract vehicles such as the GSA schedules. It is currently planned that the USITC will seek a single integrating contractor rather than manage several separate contracts. This integrating contractor may perform all tasks associated with the RFQ, or may subcontract portions of the work, provided that the integrating contractor maintains overall responsibility and accountability for task completion.

The RFQ being developed will seek a contractor to both assist the USITC in gathering and analyzing user requirements, and in implementing hardware, software, and infrastructure to fulfill those requirements, as well as ongoing support of any developed systems.

Completion of the USITC Portal Project is intended to be accomplished through a combined effort of USITC and contractor resources. Contractor resources will be accessed through a series of task orders which will be executed to implement discrete phases and ancillary tasks associated with the project. It is therefore important that any respondent to the eventual RFQ demonstrate a depth of talented staff necessary to operate effectively in such a task order environment. Resources which will be sought in the RFQ should include the areas below.
 
A)	Skilled Personnel with experience in the following:
1)	Requirements Analysis and Planning
2)	Installation and use of  any proposed Content Management Software
3)	Installation and system integration with any proposed middleware
4)	Development of Java or other appropriate language code using any proposed IDE, and integration and encapsulation of legacy resources such as Oracle servers
5)	Server installation and system administration

     B) Hardware – any respondent may propose the use of hardware manufactured or sold directly by the respondent. Optionally, the respondent may provide specifications and sources from which the USITC may procure the needed hardware

     C) Software – any respondent may propose the use of COTS software developed or sold directly by the respondent. Optionally, the respondent may provide specifications and sources from which the USITC may procure the needed COTS software.

<SUBJECT>10--Improved Crew Served Weapon Mount
<SOLNBR>N0016404R4823
<RESPDATE>040604
<CONTACT>John Pfender 8128545198
<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division and United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) are planning to acquire and qualify an improved, commercially available crew served weapons mount for small arms including 40mm, 50 caliber and 7.62 mm machine guns.  The primary application for the Improved Crew Served Weapon Mount is mounting for the Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher (ALGL) MK47 MOD 0 40mm machine gun, with secondary applications to mount the M2 50 caliber machine gun and M240 7.62mm machine gun using adapters.  USSOCOM intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to test an Improved Crew Served Weapon Mount that is envisioned as a non-stabilized mount using proprietary “soft mount” technology.  This technology should provide for improved slew and firing capability to fire from moving platforms (vehicles a nd watercraft).  Vendors must have a non-developmental /commercial MK47 / M2 / M240 small arms mount with the following features: 1) The mount must have a Quick Slewing capability providing for both major shifts in azimuth and elevation in a free gun mode. 2) The mount must provide for sufficient mounting surfaces to incorporate common interface brackets (MIL-STD-1913, etc) for fire-control devices. 3) The mount must provide for recoil buffers for MK47 / M2 / M240 weapons to isolate any sights or other gear affixed to the cradle. 4) The mount must provide common control surfaces (grips, trigger, azimuth, and elevation controls) and allow remote triggering of the weapon from grips located on the mount and isolated from the weapon.  5) The mount must include a trigger linkage to attach to the weapon and interface with the mount in such a way as to allow for removal and installati on of MK47 / M2 / M240 weapons in the mount by the gun crew in a field environment without tools.  6) The mount must interface directly with the MK47 MOD 0 machine gun and may have adapters to interface with the M2 and M240 machine guns.  Responsive vendors should have experience with systems integration and the design of military weapon mounts, electronic circuits, ballistic protection/shields for function in the SOF environment and also have capabilities including all equipment and test ranges to measure firing loads to adapt the current commercial mount to full functionality with the MK47, M2 and M240 machine guns.  The vendor must have a license from Nordic Ammunition Company (NAMMO) to use their proprietary MK438 fuze technology to build an integrated signaling /data transfer interface with the MK47 machine gun and MK285 cartridge.  Responses to this market survey are due  on or before 6 April 2004, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements including recommended spare parts and estimated spares costs, and an estimated cost for the price of five test articles for delivery within nine months after order and a lot of one hundred production mounts for delivery within six months after order (future requirements are estimated at a range of 40 - 500 mounts).  Interested parties who are willing to provide qualified hardware at no cost for USSOCOM testing should elaborate in the submitted white paper.   This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the informatio n solicited.  No solicitation exists at this time.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 6 April 2004 to Naval Surface Warfare Center; Crane Division; Attn: Code 1162 John Pfender/B. 2521; 300 Highway 361; Crane IN 47522.  Questions may be submitted in writing to the above address, or email pfender_j@crane.navy.mil. No further information is available from the Procuring Office.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting market research for the capability to move personnel and their associated gear from an offshore location, through the surf zone, and to a target location on land using a single vehicle.  USSOCOM is interested in evaluating vehicles from vendors that currently posses a “proof of concept” vehicle or have an amphibious vehicle in production.  Speed in excess of 20 knots in the water and 10 mph on land is desired.  The vehicle should be approximately 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet tall in its highest configuration.  It is necessary that the transition between marine and terrain modes not require the personnel to exit the vehicle.  Acceptable modifications to an existing vehicle would be those required to allow the craft to operate as an operational military vehicle.  Responses to this RFI are requested by 16 April 2004.  Responses must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, production capability and an estimated cost for the price of the initial vehicle to be tested and production units.  Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.  Submit the data of the item to Naval Sea Systems Command, PEO, Expeditionary Warfare, Attn: LT Keith Burney, 1333 Isaac Hull Ave, SE Stop 7210 Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-7210, burneykd@navsea.navy.mil  (202) 781-5715.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny, NJ  07806-5000  seeks to acquire the services of a qualified vendor to provide detailed system  design, fabrication, installation, startup, testing, and demonstration/ validation of a transportable cryofracture treatment system to be used for the complete demilitarization of a wide variety of high explosive containing  munitions to include grenades, mines, submunitions, and projectiles, with a maximum allowable munition design equivalent to a 105mm HE projectile. It is intended that the transportable cryofracture system be integrated with a transportable plasma arc system to be provided by others. The combined  cryofracture/plasma arc system is planned for installation at a DOD facility  to be determined at a later date. The transportable cryofracture system will  be designed such that all required utilities and a control room are provided  as transportable, self-contained modules. The interface between the cryofracture and plasma arc systems will be the combined responsibility of the cryofracture and plasma arc contractors with specific responsibilities established as the project progresses.  The process involves downloading of  the munitions, robotic handling of the munitions, cryofracture of the munitions, transfer of the cryofractured debris into the plasma arc system, thermal processing of the debris, collection of solid residual material and  treatment of effluent gases.

Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their offer for both the offeror and their proposed major subcontractors: A list of all relevant (i.e., hoist) contracts and subcontracts performed within the past three years, including all contracts and subcontracts currently in progress.  Contracts listed may include those with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers.  Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.

		1.  Name of contracting activity/company
		2.  Work performed and contract number, if applicable
		3.  Total contract value

Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance and timeliness of service.  The Government may contact references other than those identified by the offeror, and the information subsequently received may used in the evaluation of the past performance.   Basis for Award: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government based on the following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance:
1.	Technical Capability
2.	Price
3.	Past Performance
Technical Capability and Past Performance when combined are more important than price.  Offerors are specifically advised that under this evaluation method, the lowest priced proposal may not necessarily receive the award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to establish a one-year Requirements Contract for commercial services (Structural Workers/Lead Structural Worker) and is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    The Request for Quotation Number is HSCG40-04-Q-40005.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-20.  The applicable North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 336611 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.  If a delivery order is issued under this contract for hours of Structural Workers/Lead Structural Worker services, the contractor shall supply the required job classifications within six (6) business days.  Conduct of Performance:  Each delivery order issued under this contract shall contain a work statement defining the location where work will be performed, a general description of the work to be performed, and the number of hours required for each labor category.  The Lead Structural Worker shall report to the Coast Guard Technical Point of contact, as specified on the delivery order, at the beginning of each workday to report the accomplishments of the tasks completed the day before and for an inspection of the services that have been performed.  At this time, any necessary redirection of the effort shall be communicated via verbal task order by the Coast Guard technical point of contact within the scope of the delivery order and within the hours authorized by the individual order.    The Lead Structural Worker shall be responsible for the performance of the tasks under each order and shall be responsible for communicating and directing all effort under each order to the Structural Workers.  Equipment Responsibility:  The contractor shall be responsible for providing his/her own basic hand tools such as a hammer, clamps, etc., safety helmets, glasses, and shoes.  The Coast Guard YARD will provide any specialized tools that may be necessary.  Officials authorized to place delivery orders:  U.S.C.G. Engineering Logistics Center, YARD Acquisitions Branch, Bldg. 58, 2nd Floor, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226.    Statement of Work:  The Contractor’s Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker shall perform journeyman ship fitting and welding tasks involved in the construction, repair, maintenance, overhaul, and conversion of various sizes and types of marine crafts and vessels and in connection with miscellaneous manufacturing projects performed at the Coast Guard Yard.  Performance shall include, at a minimum, 1) Reading blueprints, developing templates, layouts, and equipment; 2) Sub assembly of the various components involved; 3) Air testing and ultrasonic testing of compartments in the vessels (may be required); and (4) Ultrasonic readings of the thickness of hull plating.  All services shall be performed at the U.S. Coast Guard YARD on or around ships in dry-dock, at dockside, or in Coast Guard YARD Industrial shops.    The contractor shall supply workers experienced and capable of working in a shipyard environment.    The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses apply:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2004) and the following addenda:  General Instructions: It is intended to award a one-year Requirements-Type Contract for the delivery of Structural Worker/Lead Structural Worker services to the United States Coast Guard YARD, Curtis Bay, Baltimore, MD.    The services shall be issued via delivery orders and are in support of Shipyard availabilities.    It is essential that the proper skill level of Structural Workers be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.    Any delay to a shipyard availability due to inferior structural services would be costly to the Government and is a primary consideration in the award and continuation of any resulting award.    The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – Structural Workers/Lead Structural Worker must have a thorough knowledge of marine blueprint reading and lay outs, some knowledge of mechanical drawing, a thorough knowledge of the practices, processes, and materials of the trade, a good working knowledge of allied trades, a thorough knowledge of shop mathematics, and knowledge of ship building nomenclature  and abbreviations.  Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker must have knowledge of the various metal forming machines required in fabricating ship structures and SMAW (Shield Metal Arc Welding), GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding), and the electrical welding circuit. Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker must be able to pass and maintain welding certification to procedures qualified to work he is assigned. In addition, Structural Workers and Lead Structural Worker must possess a high degree of accuracy, skill, and aptitude in development of the work and be able to keep pace with technological developments in the trade.  Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications of the Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Structural Workers/Lead Structural Worker.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum three (3) qualified Marine Structural Workers and a Lead Marine Structural Worker within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.    Price Proposal: Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  CLIN 0001 – STRUCTURAL WORKER and CLIN 0002 - LEAD STRUCTURAL WORKER.    These rates shall include all costs to perform the required services.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours, inclusive of overtime, (1,200 hrs/Structural Workers, 180 hours Lead Structural Workers) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Structural Workers is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Structural.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Structural Workers/Lead Structural Workers shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.    All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.   On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Structural Workers are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Structural Workers and 30 for the Lead Structural Worker.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

The NLM is developing and managing MedlinePlus, an easily understandable World Wide Web resource to assist consumers in obtaining the information they need to make informed decisions about health care.   MedlinePlus links to MEDLINE, the world's largest database of peer-reviewed information, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consumer health information, clearinghouses, health-related organizations, and clinical trials.  In addition to general health topics, MedlinePlus provides access to extensive, authoritative information about specific diseases and conditions ("Health Topics").  The site includes comprehensive and cutting-edge information on over 650 diseases and conditions.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain access to the authoritative, consumer-oriented drug information needed to complement other information available on the site.  The USP is the organization that sets the official standards of strength, quality, purity, packaging and labeling for medical products used in the United States.  Congress has recognized the USP and the national Formulary as the official U.S. compendia for standards for drugs and for the inactive ingredients in drug dosage forms.  The USP DI is the unquestioned American source for independent, authoritative information on drugs marketed in the United States and Canada. Volume I of the USP DI, contains drug use information in technical language for the professional health care provider (e.g. physicians, pharmacists, nurses, etc.).  Volume II, the product which the NLM intends to procure, is its lay language counterpart for use by consumers.  Thomson MICROMEDEX has been given exclusive rights to market the USP DI, and the product is available only from that source.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.

<DESC>The Department of State has a requirement for the production of a report concerning the nature and extent of official corruption in Cambodia associated with trafficking in persons (TIP).  Towards that end, the contractor will analyze how government corruption in Cambodia facilitates trafficking in persons (TIP). 

I.  Statement of Work

The report will:

A.	Describe corrupt government officials’ methods, techniques and motivations in the context of TIP.  It will also address the types of trafficking-related official abuses: in police departments, military services, security services, immigration services, social services, as well as among elected officials and their staff.   

B.	Examine the factors that induce officials to abuse their authority to assist traffickers, such as receiving financial payoffs or other illicit favors.  The report will address the motivations of corrupt officials -- the nature of officials who seek quick financial profits, those who are outright traffickers themselves or secret members of criminal organizations, and those who act to further their non-monetary interests.

C.	Provide insights on the cultural factors that contribute to TIP corruption, explaining how and why corrupt officials aid family and clan members who are traffickers or owners of establishments that exploit trafficking victims.  

D.	Provide a full review of the typical modus operandi of how traffickers recruit and “turn” officials to abet trafficking.

E.	Address the unofficial structures and links between traffickers and officials, i.e., how are TIP-corrupt officials organized and connected?;  how are payoffs and favors delivered?;  do corrupt officials understand the TIP crime?;  what government resources are improperly employed?;  what government efforts are undertaken to remove and deal with corrupt officials?

F.	Discuss patterns of corruption, the modus operandi of its agents, scenarios of corruption and similar concepts the understanding of which would further understanding of trafficking in persons in Cambodian.

G.	Recommend institutional changes that could potentially improve the government’s response to TIP corruption

II. Technical Evaluation Criteria

A.  Understanding and experience with the global problem of trafficking in persons.

B.  Understanding of the issue of trafficking in persons in Southeast Asia generally and in Cambodia specifically.

C.  Fluency in Khmer of primary researchers.

III. Location of Work

The research will take place in Cambodia.

IV. Limitations on Information Sharing

The contractor will not discuss the work under this contract with anyone other than personnel of the Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons without the prior written approval of that Office.

V. Period of Performance

The contractor’s initial findings will be presented to the Office of Trafficking in Persons by May 15, 2004. The final report must be submitted by August 16, 2004.
