<DESC>Research Services for Comparing the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey to the Current Population Survey

Supporting Statement


Introduction

The Census Bureau conducted the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) during 2000 and 2001 in nationwide tests of the American Community Survey (ACS) questionnaire.  For both years, the sample size was 700,000 households.  The tests were designed to demonstrate the viability of using data collected over several years as a replacement for the Census long form.  The C2SS included questions about work and search for work so that some rough measure of labor force would be available along with the other social and economic data collected in the survey.  

BLS staff has conducted preliminary reviews of the 2000 C2SS data.  (Data for the 2001 C2SS will be available during the summer of 2002.)  These data differ from the official measures of employment and unemployment for the nation obtained from the Current Population Survey and from the official State labor force data developed from the LAUS program.  The C2SS data report a population and civilian labor force that are lower than the CPS annual average for 2000.  Employment and the employment-to-population ratios from the C2SS are lower than those obtained from the CPS and unemployment levels and rates are higher.  The difference in the population data is counter to expectations, especially because the C2SS uses 2000 Census population controls as enumerated.  However, the universe for the C2SS does not include group quarters, which are included in the CPS.

A number of factors may account for the differences in the estimates.  For example, the C2SS has less detailed questions about employment and unemployment than the CPS.   In addition, the CPS collects data for a fixed reference period, the week that includes the 12th of the month, while the reference period for the C2SS depends on when the respondent fills out the survey.  Other reasons for differences in the estimates include the population controls and universe used by the surveys and different modes of collections ? interviewers for the CPS versus primarily mail response for the C2SS.  


Objectives
The aim of this project is to understand the nature of the differences in labor force estimates between the C2SS and the CPS.


Description of the Project

1.	Review what is currently known and available.  This includes a careful review of existing documentation and interviewing BLS and Census research staff.
2.	Examine the year 2000 tabulations of the C2SS and compare findings with the CPS.  Extend current analysis by making comparisons by age and ethnicity, retaining State detail.  Explore differences attributed to collection mode, reference date, and nonresponse adjustment.
3.	Identify and compare the consistency of patterns observed in the C2SS data for 2001 with 2000.  It is possible that the differences observed in 2000 will be smaller in 2001. 

Description and Scope of Work

The contractor shall develop and test a methodology for comparing the C2SS (both 2000 and 2001 estimates) with those for the CPS.  Further, the contractor will make recommendations on the potential use of the C2SS data in the LAUS methodology, either directly or indirectly. 

The research shall be carried out over a 9-month period, July 1, 2002?March 31, 2003.   Regular contact with BLS staff is planned.  Contact with Bureau of the Census staff may also be required.  A draft report concerning the research shall be submitted by September 30, 2002.  Two presentations at BLS conferences may be performed with travel expenses the responsibility of BLS.   The draft  report in October 22-24, 2002, in San Antonio, Texas.   The final  report will be submitted by January 31, 2003.   Throughout the period, regular communications (at least twice a month) with BLS will take place in the form of e-mail and other exchanges.

Inspection and Acceptance

BLS will make the final inspection and acceptance of all items called for in the project.


Deliverables

The provider shall submit the following items to BLS.  The delivery dates are measured from the commencement of the project, July 1, 2002.  

Item		Description					Delivery Date
1.  	Letter of understanding on work 		2 weeks upon award of PO
				
2.  		Draft project report				September 30, 2002

3.	                  Presentation of findings			October 22-24, 2002

4.			Final project report				March 31, 2003




The report shall include at least:
Descriptions of methodology
Results
Recommendations for implementation
Suggestions for further research

<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory is seeking partnership through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to accelerate the commercialization of the Transportable Oversize Waste Reduction System (TOWRS). The system consists of a 1.5 kW Nd:YAG laser with a water chiller mounted inside a 53? tractor trailer. Two six-axis robots, with controllers and camera system are available for mounting of the autofocus end-effector and for remote handling of the cut pieces. A six foot rotatable load table and an interlocked containment structure complete the system. The system is designed for the size reduction of transuranic contaminated large metal objects, such as gloveboxes, pipes, reactors, ductwork, etc.
The commercial partner should have significant experience with various size reduction techniques and technologies. Specific experience in the size reduction of radioactively-contaminated metallic objects, such as gloveboxes, tanks, piping, will be given preference. Specific experience in the control of work activities in Pu-contaminated environments, such as critically control, ventilation control, contamination control, personal protection, procedure compliance, etc. is desirable. Previous experience at major DOE sites assisting with decontamination, decommissioning, dismantlement, and disposal for stabilization of nuclear facilities is highly desirable. Demonstrated ability to integrate size reduction technologies into D&D operations and previous experience commercializing technology out of a DOE National Laboratory are highly desirable.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nonmetallic Materials Division is contemplating a Sole Source award for "Improved Methods Development for Determining Thermophysical and Thermochemical Properties" to Phoenix Chemical Laboratory) for determining the thermophysical properties of advanced Air Force functional fluids and lubricants using existing methods where available and developing new methods where needed. The award will be a follow-on contract to F33615-95-C-5027 also titled "Improved Methods Development for Determining Thermophysical and Thermochemical Properties".  The award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with an estimated value of $800,000 over 5 years.  Technical, financial, and progress reports are also required.  The research efforts of the AFRL Materials and Manufacturing Directorate's Nonstructural Materials Branch produce a wide variety of candidate advanced fluid and lubricant base fluids, additives and formulations.  The anticipated chemical classes of the majority of the anticipated candidate materials are the polyaphaolefins, silahydrocarbons and the perfluoropolyalkylethers.  Their unique chemistry results in many of the existing test methods, which were originally developed to study mineral oil based fluids, to be not applicable.  Another factor deficiency with most standard test methods is that they frequently require significantly larger sample sizes than are typically available with advanced fluids and lubricants based on newly emerging materials technology.    The specific new and improved test methods required are: (1) An improved test method to measure the low temperature viscosity (or determine the low temperature operability) of candidate greases at temperatures down to -54oC.  (2) Develop methods to test candidate efficient, cost effective replacement solvents for the banned chlorofluorocarbon solvent.  Properties of interest are cleaning efficiency, materials compatibility, environmental impact and handling safety.  (3) Development of an efficient, effective test method to determine the rust inhibiting properties of candidate greases.  (4) Improved methods to determine hot surface and other ignition characteristics of candidate liquid lubricants and other functional fluids.  Other thermochemical and thermophysical properties of interest include: thermal and corrosion-oxidation stability up to 400oC, isothermal secant and adiabatic tangent bulk moduli and pressure-viscosity coefficient for pressures from 0 to 10000 psia at temperatures up to 315oC, oxygen absorption characteristics at temperatures of 160oC to 425oC and pressures up to 1000 psia, corrosion inhibition properties, vapor pressure up to 400oC, lubricity up to 400oC, oxygen sensitivity and metal analysis.    Approximately one-half man-year of technical effort, per year, is required.  
Any source interested in this requirement should respond by fully describing the appropriate equipment, facilities, background and experiences of the responding organizations.  Responses must include the identity and resumes of all personnel to be utilized.  Organizational brochures and letters of interest are unacceptable.  Closing date for submission of response is within fifteen (15) days from publication of this notice via U.S. Postal Service.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business, an 8(a) firm, or a HUB Zone program.  NAIC 541710 applies.  All respondents shall include in the response their assigned Commercial and Government Entity (Cage) code [Federal Supply Code for Manufacturers, a five digit code assigned by the Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), Attn:  Customer Service Office, Battle Creek, MI, phone no.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to award a Time and Materials IDIQ contract, on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis, to The Copernicus Group, 3005 Chestnut Rd, Hendersonville, NC 28792 to develop a demonstrable weapons grid and to identify and develop prototype systems for the weapons grid.  The contractor shall customize a technology scenario planning (TSP) methodology to determine future technology thrusts for NAVAIRWD.  The TSP used shall simultaneously enable new innovation mechanisms within the organization.  The Contractor shall facilitate and coach participants in the TSP methodology, train a core Government group in the customized TSP so that NAVAIRWD can grow an in-house capability, share lessons learned from other work, and synthesize data to support prioritization recommendations.   Additionally, the contractor shall help in the synchronization of the weapons grid with other Government organizations and agencies (e.g. Homeland Defense, Coast Guard, National Reconnaissance Office, law enforcement agencies, Center for Disease Control).  Preliminary concept definition was accomplished under a fixed price GSA order (# GS-10F-0083L).   The contractor will be required to apply a systems thinking approach to integrate and synthesize work in the following areas:  Network Centric Warfare (NCW), Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), military history, C4ISR, theory of grids, military intelligence, netwar, quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, theoretical and applied mathematics (including algorithm development), establishing quick turn-around, rapid prototyping shops, biochemistry, POM process, Congressional processes and procedures, technology scenario planning (TSP), and information technology.  The Copernicus Group, Inc. is uniquely qualified to conduct this effort.  Copernicus has specific, applicable experience in the required disciplines, including grid theory and technology scenario planning with various Government agencies and commercial entities.  The Copernicus Group, Inc. wrote and published the original Grid Theory concept.    Additionally, they offer a unique workshop series on Shaping Chaos and Network Centric Warfare's (NCW) relationship to the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA).  These workshops will allow the contractor to transfer to the Government team the requisite knowledge and skills we need in NCW and RMA to be able to develop and apply TSP in a relatively short time frame.   This contract will have a three-year ordering period.  The total estimated maximum level of effort for this effort is approximately 14,200 hours.   Interested persons should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by June 11, 2002.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Virginia Contracting Activity on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency, request for proposals in support of the attached Statement of Work for a technological upgrade of the existing turnstiles at Building 6000, 200 MacDill Blvd., Bolling AFB, Washington, DC.  The existing turnstiles use a turnbuckle resistance arm and only provide narrow lanes (24 inches clearance) for the majority of DIA employees and visitors.  Optical turnstiles are a current technology upgrade and meet all current ADA, life safety, and fire safety requirements.  They also reduce the need for constant vigilance of uniformed officers at access and egress points.  Turnstiles provide a necessary Force Protection Service by controlling the flow of personnel, ensuring that properly ?badged? personnel are allowed in and out, and provide additional force protection measures in the event of an emergency.  The current turnstiles do not provide adequate force protection measures.  The proposed upgrade of DIAC turnstiles is necessary to bring this equipment to the current state-of-the-art technology.  Each of the 8 lanes will meet fire safety, life safety, and ADA requirements.  A Firm Fixed-Price award will be issued to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government (Best Value), on the basis of technical approach, expertise/experience and cost. Technical approach and expertise/experience are significantly more important than cost.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, FAC 01-06.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Offerors should submit their responses IAW the directions in the attached RFP document.  The Request for Quotation has the Statement of Work can be accessed at this site under MDA908-02-Q-0141. 

Bid should be submitted via email at:  jill.kline@dia.mil;   Subject line MUST read: MDA908-02-Q-0141 or Faxed to 202-231-2831. Offerors are responsible for confirming that submissions were received by the contracting office before bid closing.

General Information:  USP Pollock has approximately 415 employees.  Historical data indicates that on average 114 employees will visit the fitness center per month for roughly 660 visits per month.  The membership will be in the name of the institution not the individual employees and a one time membership fee for usage will be paid within 30 days of award.  The membership will cover complete usage of the fitness center (except babysitting or any additional services that are not passed on to other memberships) and will be offered to all employees regardless of usage.

The effective date of the contract is expected to be October 1, 2002.  The Government is requesting two different quotes.  Quote #1 will be for a 12 month period and Quote #2 will be for a six month period from October to March of each year.    
     	
The Government reserves the right to choose the best overall proposal.  Interested parties may submit additional proposals or options.                          
           
Eligibility: All full time employees will be eligible to participate in this program.  Once the open enrollment has ended, the fitness center will need to provide the Executive Assistant a roster of plan participants.  The fitness center will also be required to provide updates throughout the term of the contract upon our request.

Project Summary: The scope of services under this proposed contract includes window refurbishment in the historic North building; elevator replacement; upgrades to the electrical system; sidewalk vault repairs; installation of an emergency generator and an option for elevator maintenance service after construction is complete.  The building will remain fully occupied by various Federal tenants, and it will be the contractor?s responsibility to phase and coordinate all work around these tenants. The estimated cost of construction falls within the range of $5.0 million to $10.0 million, with anticipated construction duration of approximately twenty-one (21) months.  Funds are currently available for this acquisition.  Procurement Type and Methodology: A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.3 for Source Selection procedures and the Best Value Trade-Off process.  For this procurement, the following technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price: 1. Past Experience with Similar Projects, 2. Past Performance on Similar Projects, and 3. Qualifications of Key Subcontractors.  When technical factors are equal between offerors, price becomes more important.  Proposal Requirements and Selection Process: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, Source Selection process.  Under Stage 1, offerors will submit technical proposals (regarding qualifications, past experience, references, personnel, and resources that clearly address the evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal) and price proposals in separate envelopes.  The evaluation factors summarized above will be used in Stage 1 to evaluate technical proposals and determine a competitive range of the most highly qualified firms that will be invited to participate in an oral presentation to take place in Chicago, IL, tentatively July 17-18, 2002.  The competitive range may be further narrowed based on the results of the interviews.  In Stage 2, price proposals will be evaluated from the firms in the competitive range.  Negotiations will be conducted if necessary, but the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without holding discussions.  The final selection will be made based on Best Value.  Small Business Requirements:  This procurement for Building Alterations falls under NAICS code 233320 and, as such, is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The small business size standard for this work category is $27.5 million.

Large businesses will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned, HUBZone small, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and Veteran-Owned small business concerns through participation as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  In Stage 2 of this process, each firm in the competitive range will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan in compliance with the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals set by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  Firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals for the above mentioned concerns.  In order to receive a price evaluation preference benefit, your firm must be certified by the Small Business Administration as a HUBZone small business concern and/or a small disadvantaged business concern.

<DESC>NA 33.  Question:  Could you provide a clarification of the term point and standoff with regard to chemical detection devices as found in Sections 2.4 and 2.5. Answer:  Point detectors collect samples from a single physical location (e.g. dry filter unit).  T he target substance must be transported to the detector.  Standoff detection involves sampling across a large geographic area from a single location (e.g. LIDAR).  Samples can be analyzed at a distance without transport to the detector. 34.  Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2: A).  The solicitation seeks prototype software.  Our evaluation of similar issues has indicated that such problems are best addressed through a combination of Commercial off the shelf (COTS), near-COTS, and new softw are.  Can you provide us with an estimate of this mix as sought in the PRDA?Answer:  No mix is sought by DTRA.  Use of developmental software is anticipated to fill gaps in current state of the art. B)  Question:  The text description of the need is extrem ely brief.  In order to price a solution, further details are needed such as a description of the business processes, the software requirements, details of the operating environments, a description of the desired prototype system.  Can you provide further technical details? Answer:  Systems shall be compatible with existing emergency response systems within US cities. C)  Question: Who is the intended customer(end user)? Answer: Not specified.  DTRA is the end user initially. D) Question:  What is the numbe r of awards expected for this area and the size of each or the total? Answer: 5 to 10 awards and contracts between $5M-10M or less each are anticipated for the period of performance (up to a 2 year base period and a one year option period) E).  Question: W hat is the source of the funding for this area, i.e 6.1, 6.2, etc? Answer: 6.3 funding 35.  Question:  Regarding Topic 1,  Would building a neutron imaging system (degree resolution)that will use 3He as the detector of interest or does it not fulfill the technical requirements of the PRDA? Answer:  The question is, what does this new system offer that standard He3 does not.  We are not interested in more ruggedized He3 detectors.  As stated in the PRDA, we are interested in better efficiency, neutron direction, neutron energy, and new materials for detection.  If this system offers a benefit in any of these areas, then DTRA may be interested. 36. Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2:  Would the development of antimicrobial compounds against bio-terrorism organisms be appropriate and/or considered in this solicitation of proposals? Answer: No 37.  Question:  Regarding Topic Area 1, Radionuclide Detectors  A).  In talking with a number of groups working on the development of CdZnTe gamma ray detectors and have published several papers that address the performance of CZT material and would like t o propose a modeling only response to address additional issues that will determine the ultimate performance of CZT-based detectors.  This work would benefit the whole community working on CZT based detectors.  Will such a modeling only proposal be conside red as responsive? Answer: Same as Question 10.   38.  Question:  Under Topic 2, is the hope that proposals will integrate efforts in a number of sub-topics (Software Development and Environmental Monitoring) or can a proposal emphasizing one sub-topic be successful? Answer: Single subtopic proposals have  the same level of competitiveness as integrated, multiple sub-topic proposals. 39. Question: I have the PRDA 1 and PRDA 2 documents, is there any other information about this proposal?Answer: No, however, keep checking fedbizopps for any changes in the solicitation and questions and answers. 40.  Question:  Does DTRA have a specific form for the cover page or do we just need to have the information listed in the announcement?  Answer:  Only the information listed in the announcement is needed. 41.  Question:  In regard to Topic 2,  we are cons idering an imaging FT-IR system, using a completely new concept to eliminate the background response, with a consequent improvement in sensitivity of 2, or more, orders of magnitude as well as a marked reduction in the false alarm rate. As it is currently conceived, the system will detect very low concentrations of chemical warfare agents, explosives and other threats with output to a CRT, in combination with an alarm system. The approach is ideal for border crossings, where vehicles could be rapidly scanne d using stand-off instrumentation. The specific question is centered on the phrase in canisters, shipping containers and hold baggage. While our system will be very sensitive to traces of chemicals on the outsides of these items and vehicles, it will have no capability of determining the contents. Normally this approach is the basis for explosive detectors in airports. It is very difficult to fill a container of any sort without traces of the material being detectable on the outside surfaces. This is especi ally true for low vapor pressure materials such as nerve agents and explosives. Answer:  In assuming that the question is Is detection on the surface of a container the same as detection within a container, the answer is technically no.  However, surface c ontamination may be an indication of material within a container.  This could be used as a trigger for further characterization. 42.  Question:  Under Topic area 2, it states that $10M in awards are anticipated for the base period with 5-10 awards.  Does this mean that there will be $10M worth of awards as a total or that DTRA is expecting 5-10 awards of $10M each. Answer:  Proposal s may be $5-$10M or under each.  There is $50M total anticipated for all awards under this topic area. 43.  Question:  We understand that each Topic area requires a separate proposal, but in addressing a Topic Area such as 2, will you accept proposals for a single section such as 2.1, or are you expecting a single proposal addressing all subparagraphs 2.1 t hrough 2.5? Answer:  Yes, a proposal for a single section will be accepted. 44.  Question:  By methods should be validated, do you mean validation should have already occurred and be documented or can validation of the proposed technical methods occur during the contract period of performance? Answer:   Analysis of chemical and biological samples independently is satisfactory.  45.   Question:  For Topic Area 1, Radionuclide Detectors, Section 1.1, Improved Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Systems; Is there a preferred range of gamma ray energies that the proposed system should be optimized for? Answer: The intent is to detect and identify  highly enriched uranium and weapon grade plutonium. There are many different views on how to do this. That is part of the challenge of the detector design. Too detailed of input may limit the innovation. There are two goals: 1. A system similar to HPGe wi thout the logistics of liquid nitrogen; 2. A system similiar to NaI, but with a signifantly better resolution (2-3%) at 661 KeV. 46. Question:  Is the Program looking for very advanced, innovative, high/risk-high pay-off technologies or for those technologies which have relatively established basic understanding and are quickly transferable into a portable Chemical and Biological Ag ent Detection system? Answer:  Yes 47.  Question:  Is sample preparation, both for clinical and environmental samples and its integration with the array based detection system responsive and/or essential to the topic? Answer:  Responsive but not essential.  48.  Question:  Are you looking for a portable, field system for both chemical and biological agent detection, or addressing one type of agent (chemical or biological) is satisfactory?Answer:  Analysis of chemical and biological samples independently is sa tisfactory. 49.  Question: Are there any defined/desirable specifications for a potential device (how many agents, detection time, portability, weight, power requirements, etc )?Answer: System design specifications have not been specified. 50.  Question:  If one proposes a highly innovative concept for rapid detection of biological agents, with no supporting experimental data, would it be still a competitive proposal?  Answer:  No 51.  Question:  To what extent will neutrons from the source background be moderated before reaching the detector? Answer:  In general this is unknown.  We are dealing with the neutron emission from Pu-240.  There will be some moderation and attenuation as  neutrons pass through the weapon and container.  There is no intent to add extra moderation to the storage container, but an entity attempting to hide a nuclear weapon may chose to use shielding and moderators to avoid detection.  This offers too many pos sibilities.  Our desire is to interrogate an unknown container that is suspect of having nuclear materials inside. 52.  Question:  Is partnership between institutions, e.g., with National Labs acceptable and/or encouraged? Answer:  Partnering/teaming is encouraged.  However, DOE or DOD labs are prohibited from proposing as either a prime or a subcontractor on this soli citation. 53.  Question:  Are there any specific agents of particular interest to the program, e.g. CDC's A list of biological agents?  Answer:  Actual list is classified but CDC list A is suitable for this solicitation.   54.  Question:  Does DTRA have preferred vendors?   Answer:  No 55.  Question:  I wasn't able to locate anything about the proposal format.  What is the proposal format?Answer:  The format for the technical and cost proposal are listed in the DTRA PRDA solicitation and modification 01 listed on the fedbizopps website. 56.  Question:  Under Topic Area 2, Section 2.5, you state: Validation of devices is desired. Is this a desire for the proposal or will be part of the contracted activities?  What level of validation is required?  Who does this kind of validation?Answer: Validation standards vary.  The intent is to use vendor developed protocols for validation.  DTRA reserves the right to submit devices to independent third parties for validation.  Cost incurred shall be the responsibility of DTRA. 57.  Question:  Under Section 2.5, what is low cost?Answer:  Less than $250K per device. 58.  Question:  a. Are you looking for a combined chemical and biological agent detector?Answer: It is not necessary to be a combined sensor. b.  Question:  Can we submit a sensor capable of only detecting chemical agents? Answer:  Yes 59.  Question:  Are there specific target chemical agents you are hoping to detect and what would those agents be?Answer:  No 60.  Question:  Do you have specific applications you would like to see these systems be used for?  What are the priority features you would like these systems to exhibit?Answer:    Continuous operation, low O&M costs. 61.  Question:  Do you have a preference for certain technologies for detection? Answer:  See answer to # 5. 62. Question:  Can government agencies such as USARIEM or USACEHR team with us in responding to the PRDA? Before we form a team, the question is:  Can a government team be a part of the team and receive program dollars (i.e. deriving direct funding from th ese activities?). Answer: No, Government agencies cannot receive direct funding, just as FFRDCs cannot. 63.  Question:  Under technical proposal format requirements, it is stated that the technical proposal shall not exceed 45 single spaced pages.  Does this mean that each technical proposal covering one sub-topic, such as sub task 2.1 Software Development, is limited to 45 pages or that the entire proposal covering sub-topics 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 should be limited to 45 pages?   Answer:  It means that the entire proposal covering all subtopics proposed is limited to 45 pages. 64.  Question: In regard to curriculum Vitae of the solicitation, Is all biographical information, including for the PI, in Annex A?  Or is the CV for the PI in the main proposal, and  counts against the 45 page limit with only supporting personnel included in the Annex? Answer:  The curriculum vitae does count against the 45 page limit. 65. Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2, Is there any interest in enhancing commercial off the shelf display-based technologies (e.g. PDAs, cell-phones, and other portable devices) to meet NBC environmental conditions? Answer:  Only if the devices can provide performance equivalent to current lab-based or rapid field assays. 66.  Question:  Where will the detectors be used:  Indoors or Outdoors?  Answer:  Outdoors primarily 67.  Question:  What is the form of the radioactive materials?  Answer:  Primarily Plutonium and uranium metal used in nuclear weapons, but could be oxides of plutonium and Uranium.  Additional area would look at radiological dispersal devices.  This could  take many forms. 68.  Question:  What quantities or radioactivity must be detected (MDA)?  Answer:  Amounts above 0.5 kg. 69.  Question:  What time frame is required for the measurements?  Answer:  In some cases, the time could be as much as 5-10 minutes, but in counter terrorism applications, the count time could be under 1 minute. 70.  Question:  Should radioactivity analysis be performed on-line or off-line?  Answer:  There will be the need to perform the analysis immediately on sight.  In some cases, the date will not be allowed to be saved to protect weapon design information.  T here is a small need to be able to transmit data so a more detailed analysis by a trained physist can be performed. 71.  Question:  In regard to improved neutron detectors, What is the purpose of the neutron measurements?  Answer:  Primarily to confirm the presence of Plutonium 240.  It may also be used to determine quantity of plutonium or locate a source. 72.  Question:  What is more important, total sensitivity or directional dependence?  Answer:  Sensitivity is of primary importance. 73.   With respect to section 2.3 Development and Validation of Advanced Diagnostics. The questions follow.1) The solicition specifically calls out technologies invoving micro-arrays. Can you give a better definition of an micro-array in terms of expected size (both cell size and number of array cells)  Answer: Array size and density is dependent on the number of agents analyzed, the analytical approach, number of targets needed to resolve near-neighbors and the redundance of spots. In general, an array in the hundreds to thousands of cell should be anticipated. 2) The solicitation mentions a desire for the use of PCR assays. Is this exclusive? Would other technologies that do not involve PCR be appropriate?  Answer:  Any technique that provides comparable s ensitivity, selectivity, speed and level of detection is acceptable NOTICE:  Offerors are advised that Dyncorp and ITT will be involved in the peer review process (proposal evaluation) for this solicitation.  Anyone having access to the offeror's proposal will be required to sign conflict of interest/non-disclosure statements.

<DESC>NA Corrected Announcement: Network Environment for C3 Mobile Systems (NECMS)/Mobility Assessment Test & Integration Center (MATIC)   Establishment of An R&D Experimentation Site for Demonstration of Tactical, Multi-Tier Network Wireless Communication Systems  The Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) is interested in soliciting proposals for   the capabilities to perform large-scale evaluation and experimentation of highly mobile, wireless communication, network centric systems in an operationa lly realistic field environment that is representative of the varied terrain encountered in the battlefield.  Experimentation and evaluation must be accomplished in an open wide area, capable of accommodating a simulated, operational Army Division.  The si ze of the required area is 1500 square kilometers or larger.  The land should be unencumbered by zoning restrictions and compatible with the U.S. Army maneuver needs.  In order to perform RF propagation study under different EM environment the terrain most  beneficial will contain a variety of vegetation but will not have dense forests that impede maneuver.  The terrain should be varied, with some sections having obstacles that block RF propagation in the VHF and UHF spectrum.  The RF Noise Floor should be a pproximately (negative)–100 dBm, (with some exceptions allowed), with very low spectral activity.  The site must have approval to be included in the N.T.I.A. Manual as an “Experimental Site”.  The site must be available for use with little or no notice yea r round on a non-interference basis with other local radio or telecommunication services.  The contractor shall have previous experience in tactical switching and networking.   The experimentation site shall also have control and monitoring facilities to evaluate and experiment with networked radio systems in an instrumented laboratory environment with Telecom/Data connections to distant laboratory facilities.  The laboratory, co ntrol, and office facilities will be required to house radios, computers, a networking test-bed, and test monitoring equipment.  A facility will be established, if none already exists, to serve as a field extension to the CECOM lab for conducting scalable experiments in an instrumented, mobile, field environment.  The contractor shall have access to Fiber Optic lines for utilization. There shall also be a capability to measure electronic sensitivity and performance of RF systems within an Electro-Magnetic I nterference (EMI) shielded chamber.  The shielded chamber shall be of sufficient size to perform certified measurements pursuant to (but not limited to) MIL-STD-461 & 462.  The chamber shall be equipped with filtered power and proper grounding commensurate  with standard EMI chambers. A preliminary proof of concept demonstration will be required in August 2002.   An on-site RF spectral survey including ambient RF measurements will be performed. In addition to that, an RF coverage prediction analysis including future spectrum usability must be performed. These studies will evaluate and forecast the local RF environm ent and noise characteristics that are critical for reliable and spectrally efficient operation of the test-bed. As part of this effort, the contractor will have to plan, coordinate and conduct laboratory experimentations and field demonstrations on mobile, wireless technologies and systems in support of the Army Ground Mobile Forces.  A field demonstration on potent ial candidate systems, eg, MOSAIC, SUO radio and Universal Handset Systems will be required to demonstrate the operational capability of the facility and field site.  The contractor will also have the capability to perform data collection and analysis for all lab and field demonstrations.   The period of performance for this effort is twelve (12) months.

<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire Navy Family Study services in support of the Navy Personnel Command and its Family Advocacy Program on a sole source basis.  Under the proposed acquisition, a Navy Domestic Violence Intervention Study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of three interventions designed to treat men substantiated for abuse of their wives/partners, taking into consideration the offender type.  This study will examine the interaction between offender type and intervention type, which will ultimately allow the Navy to maximize intervention effectiveness by tailoring treatment services to the individual offender.  This work initially began under a study conducted at the San Diego Family advocacy Center in which a comparison of 861 cases of substantiated spouse abuse were studied in four experimental treatment groups to determine if the services provided by the by the Navy were effective in reducing and/or stopping continued abuse. The instant acquisition will utilize the same intervention methods and tested protocols for determining typology as the prior evaluation in collecting data from an additional 600 eligible cases.  The contractor will analyze the data of both the original study and the proposed study to determine what factors are predictive of successful and unsuccessful outcomes to family violence interventions. A Cost Reimbursement-No Fee type contract is anticipated with a base period of performance commencing 01 September 2002 through 31 August 2003, with four (4), one-year option provisions.  The Government intends to solicit on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements? with the University of Colorado, 3100 Marine Street, Room 481, Boulder, CO 80309.  No other investigator(s), contractor or Government entity has access to the confidential data and the identities of the participants obtained from the original study.  Furthermore, no other investigator(s) or contractor possess the requisite skills and technical expertise necessary to create effective protocols on ?matched? or key demographic variables based on the participants, conditions, environment or forces present during the initial study.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Numbered notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) will issue a competitive Request for Proposals (RFP?s) DE-RP24-03OH20152 approximately July 29, 2002, for the closure of the Miamisburg Environmental Management Project (MEMP).  Currently, DOE anticipates the contractor to begin performance on January 1, 2003.  The resultant contract will require the contractor to bring business and industry solutions, processes, and procedures to reduce costs and achieve a safe and accelerated closure of MEMP on or before September 30, 2006, at an anticipated annual funding level of $95 million. The primary place of performance will be the MEMP site in Miamisburg, Ohio. The DOE plans to enter into a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) contract for project completion and a timely transition of land parcels and certain facilities to the Miamisburg Mound Community Improvement Corporation (MMCIC). The resultant contract will provide for cost and schedule incentives to achieve safe closure, while reducing risk to the public and workers, streamlining essential operations, minimizing infrastructure costs, and introducing new and innovative approaches for the deactivation and demolition of non-radioactively contaminated facilities.  The scope of work for the project will include, but not be limited to, activities related to sound project management and reporting, authorization safety basis, environmental remediation, facility decontamination, decommissioning and demolition, waste management, facility transition, site transition, management of legacy site costs (i.e., retiree and worker pension and medical benefits), records management and disposition, and contract transition.  An oral presentation and interviews may be required as part of the offeror=s proposal.  DOE will not issue a draft RFP for comment. Questions on the content of the RFP will be considered up to two weeks prior to the date for receipt of proposals.  If necessary, an amendment to the RFP will be issued. The DOE will sponsor two events (limit of three company representatives at each event): 1. On Tuesday June 18, 2002, the DOE will host a general discussion and site tour for all interested parties. 2. Approximately one week after the issuance of the RFP, the DOE will conduct a pre-proposal conference.  The DOE will provide structured access to MEMP for facility and property inspection/tours for four days as part of the pre-proposal conference. All responsible sources are requested to provide a written letter of intent to the Department of Energy, P.O. Box 529, Monroe, Ohio 45050-1434, or submitted electronically to Derrick.Franklin@Ohio.DOE.GOV.  DOE must receive the letter of intent no later than June 13, 2002.  The purpose of the letter is to allow DOE to make arrangements for site access.  Failure to provide letter of intent or participation in the events does not preclude firms from participating in the acquisition process.  The solicitation will be made available on the DOE/Ohio Field Office Home Page and http://e-center.doe.gov.  No telephonic requests for the RFP will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Timothy Korter, Gaithersburg, Maryland for services on a project entitled "Terahertz Spectroscopy of Chemical and Biological Systems".  Services shall include (1) building, maintaining and developing a far-infrared (THz) pulsed laser imaging spectrometer; (2) explore means to modify, maintain and develop time-resolved THz imaging experiments using a kHz Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser/mid-IR OPA with THz probe detection system; (3) collecting, analyzing and modeling data obtained from the above instruments; (4) aid in publication and dissemination of results, and (5) preparation of requested reports on experimental studies.  The period of performance is one year from date of award. The place of performance is the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland site.  This is a sole source with Dr. Tim Korter because he has the established experimental and theoretical expertise in using ultrafast laser techniques for the spectroscopic study of molecular dynamics, infrared absorption imaging, and modeling of vibrational processes in various material phases including liquids, liquid-surface, and solid phases.  This procurement must be made to a source that demonstrates a complete up-to-date understanding of femtosecond lasers and vibrational spectroscopy, far-infrared (THz) generation and detection using nonlinear optics, software/hardware development and its implementation for far-infrared spectroscopic data acquisition and imaging, and the ability to theoretically model experimentally obtained ultrafast THz spectra and images. Dr. Korter is the only known source at this time with the advanced training and background capable of providing the required expertise to NIST.  His publication record over the past several years has dealt exclusively with these specific abilities and related scientific issues.  Dr. Korter has authored multiple publications in archival journals on topics related to low frequency vibrational spectroscopy has several more in preparation.  Additionally, he has worked on advanced laser systems similar to the ones in our laboratory and has published several archival papers using spectroscopic techniques necessary for the contractual obligations to be successful. A purchase order shall be awarded approximately June 7, 2002 using simplified acquisition methods. Interested persons may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received by the date identified above.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation is not available.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with the University of Maryland, Office of Research Administration and Advancement, College Park, Maryland on a sole source basis for technical assistance services.  The Contractor shall develop and apply techniques for single molecule measurement and manipulation in fludic devices and in physiological conditions; identify systems for single molecule study; prepare fludic devices and samples as necessary; make and document hardware modifications as necessary; characterize samples using confocal, TIR, or near-field microscopic techniques; take data, perform analysis, model, and report on results of these studies; and document all data, analysis, and hardware changes in a series of monthly reports.  Work shall be performed at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland site.  The period of performance shall be one year starting September 1, 2002.  There is also an option for an additional option year to perform similar work.  This is a sole source with the University of Maryland because they performed a previous contract for similar services and this requirement relies upon the results and outcomes of the first year of that work.  The University of Maryland has developed the expertise and the knowledge to smoothly integrate the single molecule measurements into these new requirements.  These are state-of-the art, one-of-a-kind measurements that are not being done routinely anywhere in the world.  A new contractor would delay the project and lead to duplication of cost and effort.  Interested persons may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses receive by the date identified above.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation is not available.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to modify the existing contract entitled "Distributed Team Performance Under Stress: Experimental Studies with the Distributed Dynamic Decision-making (DDD) Simulation". This modification will be negotiated with APTIMA, Inc. located in Woburn, MA, on a sole source basis, pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1. Aptima developed the DDD software, which is a system that runs on NASA computers and is a critical platform for conducting the in-house NSBRI research study supporting team performance in long-duration space missions. To date, Aptima has worked with NASA to define precise experiments; they created DDD scenarios to meet the needs of the experiments; and they have made modifications to the DDD simulation software as required. As a result of their accomplishments, NASA-Ames is able to generate more detailed requirements for the DDD. The period of performance for this effort is six (6) months. The statement of requirements is as follows: 1. Modify interface of existing software that supports 4-person distributed team decision-making task to improve ease of use per government feedback on existing interface. 2. Develop and implement three scenarios that will enable conduct of research experiments.   Each scenario will have four versions created by manipulation of two crossed factors:    (1)  moderate vs. high levels of difficulty, and (2) cooperative vs. semi-competitive  inducement features. All three of the scenarios will be evaluated to determine whether they induce the intended behavioral effects and will be modified as needed to achieve these effects.   In addition, two training scenarios will be developed to provide practice with the interface and with all the functions of the system. 3. Develop training materials using both text and video to train both the "instructors" at NASA Ames Research Center and the research study participants.  Training materials will cover how to interact with the system, the nature of all of its functions, and error recovery.   A trainer will be present on site at NASA Ames Research Center for one week to train the local experimenters. 4. Define final performance measures to be collected automatically using the task software, as well as through observational and survey instruments.    5. Support data collection at NASA Ames Research Center through on-site oversight when study first begins.  Provide remote support throughout conduct of the research studies for the subsequent six months.    Because of the precise level of detail Aptima has developed for the experiment design since inception of the contract, they are uniquely qualified to make any additional modifications to the DDD interface, and to support the experiment as it is now being envisioned and defined by NASA-ARC. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit, in writing, their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort to the identified point of contact, not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 6, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort using full and open competition, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed. For details, see NASA Specific Note "B", under the URL identified below.  All offers submitted by qualified responsible sources will be considered by NASA-ARC.  Any referenced notes (stated above) can be viewed at the following URL:       http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is seeking an independent contractor to conduct an inquiry and develop recommendations for consideration by sovereign tribal governments to support community members who have disabilities in four selected and interconnected areas--education, health, rehabilitation and independent living.  NCD determined these priorities through (a) a review of available reports that support the premise of linkages among these areas, and (b) recent conversations with advocates and professionals, including people with disabilities, representatives and leaders of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The project must analyze the status of previous findings and recommendations and describe practices that contribute to improving the quality of life for American Indians and Alaska Natives with disabilities living on tribal lands. NCD is interested in funding an investigation wherein the contractor will: (1) summarize recommendations from relevant research and reports on health, rehabilitation, and education issues that impact independent living and self-determination realities for people with disabilities living on tribal lands; (2) provide scheduled involvement for representatives of American Indians and Alaska Native communities, advocates, and key organizations concerned with issues of education, rehabilitation, health, and independent living as project advisers; (3) identify and recommend basic factors/elements and key processes that have been productive in getting sovereign governments to develop tribal laws to protect and meet the service needs of people with disabilities who live on tribal lands; (4) provide a capacity building ?toolkit? that must be user friendly, incorporate principles of cultural competency, and include as examples for consideration what seems to be working/what has been effective in different tribal setting; (5) assess and recommend overnment-to-government (state to sovereign tribal to U.S. government) improvements in relationships needed for effective coordination across existing federally funded projects/programs; and (6) plan to broadly disseminate the project materials among Native people.
 
The plan for this investigation should project a seven (7) month implementation work schedule. The approximate release and closing dates are January 30, 2002, and March 30, 2002, respectively. The estimated contract period of performance is seven months. Requests for copies of the RFP may be made by mail or picked up on or after the issue date at the NCD address.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Overseas Buildings Operations, anticipates awarding indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts to two small business concerns. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541330, $4.0 million average.  The small business concerns shall be professional, licensed firms to provide architectural (prime or JV) and engineering services for new construction projects, project planning, facility renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, and system replacement projects, physical and technical security upgrades, and the construction and renovation of post communications centers at foreign service posts worldwide.  Construction projects are not expected to exceed $10million.  Projects may include design-build definition or bridging work.  In those cases, as in large design-bid-build projects (where construction value is over $10 million), such projects may affect the A/E's ability to participate in follow-on work or design-build teams for that project.  Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum or $100,000 in task orders over the life of each contract.  The total amount of orders issued under each contract shall not exceed $5,000,000 per year.  The contract will be for professional services to include, but not be limited to, facility assessments and architectural and engineering studies, site utilization studies and master planning, preliminary designs, design development, construction documents, specifications, construction estimates, design reviews of other A/E firms, value engineering studies or reviews, and construction phase services.  This is not a request for proposals.  Services shall include all disciplines: architectural, including historic preservation, landscape architecture, master planning, space planning, electrical distribution systems, mechanical systems, structural, blast, civil/geotechnical engineering, seismic, security systems/engineering, lighting systems, acoustical engineering, chem-bio (NBC) engineering, information/telecommunications systems, cost estimating, food service, interior design, environmental, energy conservation and sustainability, fire protection and alarm systems, scheduling, value engineering, and vertical transportation, as well as routine administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved; and ascertaining and working within the U.S. Government?s requirements and the applicable laws, codes and standards at the overseas project sites.  Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  The preparation of construction documents via alternative documentation methods (e.g. design-bid-build plans, specifications, and design-build) is required.  Construction documents shall be submitted with AutoCAD version 2000 or higher (until October 2000, AutoCAD R14.01 or higher files are acceptable), for each submission.  In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offeror must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  Specifically designated personnel assigned to this contract must also possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).  Subcontractors which will require access to classified information must also possess a DoD Secret FCL.  All offerors will be required to comply with security requirements as detailed in the NISPOM.  If a selected offeror does not possess the necessary FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for an FCL.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  A period of six calendar months from selection of the final offeror will be allowed for this offeror to obtain the necessary FCL.  After this period the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding less than five contracts under this effort.  Firms, which form joint ventures, must also comply with the above FCL and personnel security clearance requirements.  Firms responding to this announcement on or before the closing date will be considered for selection using the following evaluation criteria - 100 points maximum:  a)  Specialized experience and technical excellence in facility planning and design, sustainable design, rehabilitation/renovation, adaptive reuse, and system replacement projects involving multiple disciplines (e.g. architectural, master planning, mechanical, civil/geotechnical, structural, electrical and interior design/space planning) for facility sites, office buildings, residences, warehouses, and other support facilities - 25 pts.  b)  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, as listed above.

<CONTACT>George Leininger, Procurement Analyst, Phone (202) 874-3246, Fax (202) 874-2200, Email george.leininger@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received in response to a Request for Information (RFI), Reference Number RFI-APS for an Automated Purchasing System:

Request For Information
Automated Purchasing System
Amendment 1

Responses to Vendor Questions Received Through May 20, 2002

1.	Q:	I realize that an RFI is a request for information and not for a quote or proposal. However, when an RFI, such as this one, is released, do you use this information to award a contract? Or is it simply used to decide whether or not the organization needs such a service? Or for some other reasons?
A:	As indicated by our reference to FAR 52.215-3, we do not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI; your response will be treated as information only, and will not be used as a proposal. What we are trying to do is find out if there are existing systems that will meet our needs. If there are, and we decide to buy one, we would proceed with an acquisition appropriate to the circumstances, in conformance with the FAR. For example, if companies with systems that meet our needs have GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, then we would use the procedures in FAR 8.4.

2.	Q.	This is a new opportunity, correct? And thus, there is no incumbent contractor?
A.	Yes, this is a new opportunity. There is no incumbent contractor.

3.	Q.	Also, what is the competition type? I noticed there was a mention of GSA schedule; is this open to only GSA schedule holders or is this full and open competition?
A.	This is not a competition. This is a Request for Information as part of our market research. The acquisition strategy will be determined when the Office of Procurement completes its market research and decides to proceed with the procurement process.  

4.	Q.	Was there outside assistance in defining the requirements for this procurement? 
A.	No.

5.	Q.	If so, what is the name of the company involved? 
A.	N/A.

6.	Q.	Is there an expected timeframe for award on this procurement? 
A.	No. This is not a procurement, just a request for information (RFI).

7.	Q.	Will this be a Small Business Set-Aside?
A.	This is an RFI, issued as part of the Bureau's market research to support our acquisition planning.

8.	Q.	Is it possible to get the list of the vendors who participate in this RFI?  
A.	This is a request for information, and not a request for proposals. We're doing market research.

9.	Q.	Are there any similar systems which this RFI is based on? If so which systems?
A.	The "system" we describe in the RFI is in reality just a list of the electronic capabilities and functions we are looking for. We don't know whether such a system actually exists. That's why we issued the RFI.

10.	Q.	Do you require the system to directly connect with CCR?
A.	A web link in the APS to CCR would be sufficient. 

11.	Q.	The RFI requires procurement functions, but some or all these procurements will result in vendor term contracts, I assume the system needs to manage the contracts established.
A.	Yes, contract administration needs to be part of the APS.

12.	Q.	What is the estimated number of vendors?  
A.	As this is an RFI issued as part of the Bureau's market research effort, this information is not presently available. However, if we proceed with an actual procurement, the information you requested would be included in the resulting solicitation. What we can tell you now is that, as of April 15, 2002, the Contract Administration Division of the Office of Procurement was managing a total of 62 contracts.

13.	Q.	What is the estimated dollar value per annum of all purchases?
A.	Again, this information is not presently available, but would be included in the resulting solicitation if we proceed with an actual procurement. What we can tell you now is that, as of April 15, 2002, the Contract Administration Division of the Office of Procurement was managing contracts with a total value of about $763 million. These contracts varied widely in type, length, and dollar amount.

14.	Q.	Instead of buying a system why not contact DOD, suggest the Air Force and use their system. Will save the taxpayers some money and get you a Purchasing System.
A.	Thank you for your suggestion. The RFI, in fact, invites such an arrangement. It reads ?Interested vendors and other Government agencies are invited to submit information on the system they offer.? At this point in the process, however, we do not know all the systems used by other Government agencies, let alone which systems are available commercially. We're trying to obtain information from both communities.

15.	Q.	I had read your solicitation on the Automated Purchasing System and was thinking this described the types of web based systems we develop. We are a software company that builds commercial, custom web applications ... [that are] very stable and give the clients exactly what they need for an affordable price. ... I was curious if the requirement for off the shelf means literally "off the shelf."
A.	By ?off the shelf? we mean a system that fits the description of ?off the shelf item? in paragraph 46.101 of the FAR: ?an item produced and placed in stock by a contractor ? before receiving orders or contracts for its sale.? In other words, we are looking for a system that is already functionally complete and currently in use by commercial firms or Government agencies, that we could use with only ?minor modifications?, as described in paragraph (3)(ii) of ?commercial item? definition in FAR 2.101. The RFI specifies commercial, off-the-shelf systems, because we believe that such systems already used by Federal agencies are available from the marketplace. Additionally, such systems are likely to have achieved commercial market acceptance and thus be less expensive, faster to implement, more stable through proven reliability, and less costly to maintain than custom-built systems.  However, the purpose of this RFI is to allow the Government to obtain as much information as possible to determine the availability of automated purchasing systems. We will not categorically reject any information we receive, particularly if the information indicates that custom-built systems may be preferable to commercial off the shelf systems.

<DESC>This is an addendum to the Special Notice on Global Strike Task Force (GSTF) Industry Day, Reference-Number-AFRL-GSTF-ID, 15 May 2002.  
The Request for Information (RFI) in this addendum will be to survey the marketplace regarding the area of interest set forth therein.  This addendum does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes.

An important enabler to the Global Strike Task Force (GSTF) concept is improved, horizontal integration of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets.  Further development of predictive-analysis tools will greatly expand the power of integrated ISR assets.  Horizontally integrated ISR, combined with predictive-analysis tools, will transform the concept of intelligence preparation of the battlefield into an emerging concept called Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA).  Such awareness arises from baseline reconnaissance of the battlespace, terrain definition, focused surveillance, analysis of movement patterns, and knowledge of enemy tactics, intentions, or force distribution.  The battlespace includes a variety of enemy air, ground, and sea-based assets that could deny US air forces the ability to conduct offensive and defensive air operations.  PBA represents a revolutionary methodology for managing threat information and ultimately allows commanders to select the optimum means to achieve desired effects.

In this addendum, the AFRL Plans and Programs Directorate is seeking information that better aligns technology investments to needs which enable and enhance PBA for the GSTF Concept.  Specific information requested includes proposed concepts, system-level constructs, innovative ideas, and/or enabling technologies that enhance USAF PBA generation capabilities in support of the evolving GSTF and other emerging USAF operational concepts.

Thus the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) will add an afternoon session during the planned GSTF Industry Day on Wednesday, 26 June 2002.  It will provide information on GSTF's PBA needs and to answer any questions.  This session also will be held at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio (Building 642, Kenney Auditorium) from 1 PM to 4 PM.   The afternoon session will be unclassified, and all interested parties are invited to attend.  Notify AFRL/XPA which session, or both sessions, you plan to attend.  (Send security clearance or visit information to HQ AFRL/XPA, Attention Major David Agins, 1864 4th Street (Bldg.15), WPAFB Ohio 45433-7131.  Or you may FAX it to 937-904-7011.  The documents are needed by 17 June 2002).

RFI responses addressing the PBA aspects of GSTF are also asked to reply by 27 Sep 02.  Respondents addressing the PBA aspects of GSTF should identify whether they are a large or small business along with their company's name, address, telephone number, and a point of contact.  Information provided open source may, at the discretion of the provider, be made available to other government agencies or future industry participants in related activities who may be seeking teaming.  Government can accept classified information at multiple levels, although this is not required.  Classified information must be protected IAW applicable security directives.  The Government point of contact for receiving both unclassified and classified responses to the RFI is HQ AFRL/DS (Attention Ms. Teri Kopa), 1864 4th Street (Bldg 15, Room 225), WPAFB OH 45433-7131.  Her Unclassified FAX is 937-255-2219.  For any classified submissions, please call her first at 937-986-9862.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541360   Solicitation number RFQ-RT-02-00235 is being modified to convert from full and open competition to Sole Source. This modification also serves to provide clarification of the work to be performed under the anticipated purchase order. The work to be furnished under this solicitation consists of data manipulation of existing urban morphological data for Harris County Texas which was previously collected using Lidar technology.  The contractor will be required to process and prepare this existing data into databases of gridded building and tree canopy data.   As a  result of the original synopsis, it has become apparent that Terra Point, LLC is the only vendor that has access to existing data for Harris Country Texas. The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Terra Point, LLC, 4800 Research Forest  Drive, The Woodlands, TX 77381 for the acquisition of Urban Canopy Data and Parameters for Harris County, Texas. EPA believes that Terra Point, LLC is the only vendor known that can provide these data sets. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully  explain their capabilities in writing within 7 days of the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source(s) exist. Any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy  of the RFP will be ignored.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Barbara Nelson (E105-02) MD-33), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Old Page Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephonic requests will be honored.

<SOLNBR>NA1
<RESPDATE>040202
<CONTACT>Mark Quigley, Director of Communications, Phone 202-272-2004, Fax 202-272-2022, Email mquigley@ncd.gov
<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is seeking an independent contractor to conduct an inquiry and develop recommendations for consideration by sovereign tribal governments to support community members who have disabilities in four selected and interconnected areas--education, health, rehabilitation and independent living.  NCD determined these priorities through (a) a review of available reports that support the premise of linkages among these areas, and (b) recent conversations with advocates and professionals, including people with disabilities, representatives and leaders of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The project must analyze the status of previous findings and recommendations and describe practices that contribute to improving the quality of life for American Indians and Alaska Natives with disabilities living on tribal lands. NCD is interested in funding an investigation wherein the contractor will: (1) summarize recommendations from relevant research and reports on health, rehabilitation, and education issues that impact independent living and self-determination realities for people with disabilities living on tribal lands; (2) provide scheduled involvement for representatives of American Indians and Alaska Native communities, advocates, and key organizations concerned with issues of education, rehabilitation, health, and independent living as project advisers; (3) identify and recommend basic factors/elements and key processes that have been productive in getting sovereign governments to develop tribal laws to protect and meet the service needs of people with disabilities who live on tribal lands; (4) provide a capacity building toolkit that must be user friendly, incorporate principles of cultural competency, and include as examples for consideration what seems to be working/what has been effective in different tribal setting; (5) assess and recommend government-to-government (state to sovereign tribal to U.S. government) improvements in relationships needed for effective coordination across existing federally funded projects/programs; and (6) plan to broadly disseminate the project materials among Native people.
 
The plan for this investigation should project a seven (7) month implementation work schedule. The approximate release and closing dates are January 30, 2002, and April 2, 2002, respectively. The estimated contract period of performance is seven months. Requests for copies of the RFP may be made by mail or picked up on or after the issue date at the NCD address. All requests should reference the number and title of the RFP.  All inquiries regarding this RFP should be directed to Gerrie Hawkins, Ph.D., 202-272-2116, ghawkins@ncd.gov, addressed to the National Council on Disability, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004.
