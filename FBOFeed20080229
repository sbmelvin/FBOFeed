<SUBJECT>46--Filtration (oil removal) system for water discharge drainage sump pumps
<SOLNBR>08SI101697
<RESPDATE>042208
<ARCHDATE>02282009
<CONTACT>Becky Bailey Contract Specialist 2083785107     bbailey@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This requirement is a 100% set-aside for small business under NAICS code 333319 where the size standard is 500 employees.  The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to purchase a filtration system for drainage sump pumps located at the Third Powerplant at Grand Coulee Dam, Washington.  The Government will do the installation of the new filtration system so this acquisition is a supply requirement only.  Background:  The filtration system will be used to remove oil from the water discharge of the Third Powerplant (TPP), Grand Coulee Dam, Washington, drainage sump pumps.  The large drainage sump (at the TPP, Grand Coulee Dam) is equipped with two pumps.  Each pump nominally discharges 3,600 GPM at 100 feet total head.  Each pump has its own (separate) discharge line (that is, not into a common header).  The discharge pipe is 12-inch IPS.  The two pumps operate on a "lead/lag" control scheme, to balance the run time between them.  Under normal conditions, one pump can handle the volume of water coming into the sump.  However, in an emergency, both pumps run to provide additional drainage capacity.  Thus, the required maximum flow capacity of the system is 7,200 GPM.  This facility cannot take either pump out of service for extended periods of time.  The drainage sump currently has an oil skimmer system.  The Government is implementing a positive approach to remove oil and other contaminants from each pump's water discharge.  General System Requirements:  The proposed shall System shall have a flow capacity of 7,200 GPM, to allow both pumps to run in a plant emergency.  During normal conditions, only one of the pumps cycles on and off during the day.  This is the "lead" pump.  The other pump is the "lag" pump.  During normal conditions, the lag pump does not run.  The TPP alternates the lead and lag duties between the two pumps, to balance their running hours.  The filtration system design shall allow maintenance workers to replace the filter media in the lag pump's flow path without taking the lead pump out of service.  This procurement will be conducted as a commercial item acquisition under Parts 12 and Part 14 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  All responsible small business sources may submit a bid in response to the solicitation (once issued) which shall be considered by Reclamation.  Solicitation No. 08SI101697 for this requirement will be electronically available on or about March 14, 2008, to qualified interested parties at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Subsequent amendments to the solicitation, if any, will be promulgated via the http://www.fedbizopps.gov website.  In order to receive notice of any possible amendment you must be registered at the FBO website for this solicitation. Written and/or telephone requests will not be accepted.  Only vendors registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will be considered for award.  See www.ccr.gov for more information.  Bidders that download this solicitation must monitor the site for amendments.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Becky Bailey at (208)378-5107 or email: bbailey@pn.usbr.gov.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year plus two option years cost reimbursement contract on a sole source basis to the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, Inc (NASADAD).  The statutory authority for this sole source contract is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), per FAR 6-302.1.   It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded without competition since the purpose of this contract is to provide a support mechanism for State and CSAP collaborations to respond to recent legislative changes in SAPT Block Grant requirements. NASADAD is an organization that coordinates and serves as a representative voice for the State Alcohol and Other Drug Directors responsible for the administering the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant, supervising the drug and alcohol programs in the treatment and prevention areas at the State level.  This relationship lends to a natural opportunity for NASADAD to interact with State on a variety of topics.  If responsible sources believe there are extenuating circumstances which would enable them to perform the requirement, they may submit proposals which will be considered by CSAP/SAMHSA.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  As mentioned previously, NASADAD is an organization that coordinates and serves as a representative voice for the State Alcohol and Other Drug Directors responsible for the administering the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant, supervising the drug and alcohol programs in the treatment and prevention areas at the State level.  NASADAD?s knowledge repository of its State members will be critical in furthering discussions that will provide information to CSAP from the State perspective on prevention issues.  Interested parties may submit their proposals to Lynn Tantardini, Contract Specialist.  Responses will be received until April 14, 2008

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION

The 496th Air Base Squadron/Contracting Office will issue Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts for Architect and Engineering (A/E) services at Moron Air Base, Spain. A total of two (2) IDIQ contracts will be issued as a result of this advertisement. The performance period for each contract shall be five (5) years; one (1) base year plus four (4) option years. This requirement is unrestricted for all firms; NAICS is 541310; size standard $4.5 million or less in average annual gross receipts. 

The maximum total contract fees shall not exceed $300,000 per year, or $1,500,000 total for five years; the maximum fees for each task order shall not exceed $250,000. The minimum guaranteed amount is $2,500 per IDIQ contract, and will be issued on the first task order. All work shall be issued by means of negotiated and competed firm fixed-price task orders. 

The first two ranked firms as decided by the selection board will be required to submit firm fixed-prices on wages and disciplines.  Negotiations for the eventual contracts will be held with the first two ranked firms and follow the procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 36, as supplemented.
   
Each task order will be competed between the two firms for fair opportunity to be considered.  Awardees need not respond to every requirement for a task order requirement.  Excluding the initial task order, each Request for Proposals will be non-mandatory proposals.

<SOLNBR>FA8629-08-R-2354
<RESPDATE>033108
<ARCHDATE>04152008
<CONTACT>Nancy Leggett, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-1696, Fax (937) 255-8351, Email Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The 670 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (670 AESS), Battlefield Airmen program office, seeks to acquire and field a Guardian Angel Advanced Parachute System (GAAPS) that provides the best overall value to meet the pararescueman?s need for a single standardized harness for the parachute systems for Freefall, Static line, and Tandem configurations.  This single system will share the same external configuration, provide a greater weight capacity, reduce opening shock, and have multiple uses and deployment capabilities.   The objective for this procurement is for the delivery of specification compliant systems IAW the contract delivery schedule, delivery of the required data items and products, and execution of the associated program support.  

The Government anticipates the requirement for GAAPS will be approximately 1430 state of the art parachutes to replace the legacy parachutes currently fielded.  Options for further production, training and sustainment will also be placed on the initial contract for execution after additional production funds become available.  Thirty (30) freefall and thirty (30) static line systems are required for the initial procurement in FY08.  However, the contract is being structured on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity basis, so that other interested customers can also use this vehicle to purchase the system.  

Utilizing the Best Value approach, the government will consider innovative or individualized solutions to meeting the system and program requirements.  However, the contractor is encouraged to provide representative systems as rapidly as possible.  It is anticipated that the contractor will provide the fastest practical schedule and an alternate schedule which would accommodate additional customers.  

The proposed system shall consist of the following basic components for each configuration: 

Standardized harness and container
Canopies (main and reserve) 
Parachute deployment system for each type of system

The Government contemplates a contract that shall provide for an initial delivery order to include any initial integration efforts that need to be accomplished to meet the required baseline.  

The configuration shall consist of the following: 
GAAPS systems (described above)
Contractor and Government Technical Testing
Logistics Support (spares; training (including the systems to be used during training); technical manuals; and contractor logistics support)  

A copy of the formal RFP Number FA8629-08-R-2354 may now be accessed via the internet on on FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov .  All final technical documents are also now posted to FedBizOpps as of 29 February 2008.  All questions and comments must be submitted electronically to Ms. Nancy Leggett, Battlefield Airmen Contracting Officer at Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil.  Current POC is Ms. Nancy Leggett at phone 937-255-1696.   

Interested parties and offerors should obtain, read and review the complete information package to determine all technical requirements prior to submission of any offers.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government

A Request for Information (RFI) was sent out for this effort under the title ?Guardian Angel Advanced Parachute System?, dated 17 October 2007.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site (RRS), has a requirement for a contractor to furnish all materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to design, manage, and accomplish individual projects under the purview of Rome Research Site, NY. This includes remote sites within 35 miles of Rome Research Site, as stated in the Statement of Work.  During the contract period, Base Civil Engineering will identify construction tasks and the Contracting Office will negotiate and issue individual delivery orders to the Contractor to complete them. Projects will be in support of real property maintenance, repair, alteration, and/or new construction. The work involved may include, but is not limited to minimal design (35%), carpentry, concrete, excavating, interior, electrical, steam fitting, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, masonry, and welding.  Technical Specifications are attached.

This requirement is restricted for set-aside as a HUB-Zone competitive acquisition.     

The Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) Contract, Rome Research Site, NY, will be a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type for estimating and construction efforts. NAICS Code 236220, Size Standard $31.0 million.  The period of performance will be five (5) years; FY08 through FY12.  The estimated contract value is $20M.  The guaranteed contract minimum will be the amount of the first delivery order.  Traditionally, there have been upwards of 30 active SABER delivery orders at varying stages of completion at any given time.  However, this historical data does not necessarily reflect future SABER requirements.     

This is a follow-on effort to the current contract, F30602-03-D-5002.

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking to acquire medical countermeasures (MCM) that will support an effective public health emergency response to a radiological or nuclear event.  The United States Government (USG) contemplates a five year Firm Fixed Price single award contract for MCMs that can specifically treat the neutropenia component of Acute Radiation Syndrome.  Neutropenia is defined as the depression of neutrophils which occurs as a component of the hematologic pathologies arising following sufficient exposure to ionizing radiation (h-ARS).   It is the goal of the RFP to obtain advanced development products, i.e., at a development level, as classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are in no less than Phase 2 of the Investigational New Drug (IND) stage as well as those products which already have approved therapeutic indications.  Prior to the submission of the proposal, the offeror must have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in pathologies known to be associated with, or as components of, Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  It is the goal of BARDA to place in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Final Drug Product (FDP) which may be used for therapy of neutropenia in human subjects associated with whole body acute exposure to ionizing radiation exceeding 2 Gy.  

The desired product that will be acquired with this contract must be able to support a public health emergency.  The current post-event capabilities of the USG medical emergency personnel to organize, respond, triage, and begin treating patients victimized by a radiological or nuclear event is estimated at no less than 24 hours.  Thus an obligation of this acquisition is to acquire products that have demonstrated efficacy in treating neutropenia (i.e., increase in the peripheral blood neutrophil counts) in appropriate animal models (FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, was established in 2002; see:  Federal Register 67: 37988-37998, May 31, 2002; 21 CFR 601.90 for biologics, and, 21 CFR 313.600-650 for drugs; (with possible human subject studies, if applicable), when administered at a minimum of 24 hours, and preferably greater than 48 hours, following acute exposure to ionizing radiation, and with no pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Other requirements:  (1) delivery of 100,000 treatment courses for neutropenia; (2) Long-term storage temperature in the range of 2-8 degrees C; (3) A defined therapeutic regimen and dosing schedule for treatment of radiation-induced neutropenia; (4) Treatment of neutropenia arising from ARS with the FDP must result in a 30% increase in survival from lethal exposure to ionizing radiation relative to controls (i.e.,LD50, the dose of ionizing radiation which results in 50% lethality in untreated irradiated subjects), plus an increase in neutrophil count. (5) have an acceptable safety profile; (6) have a minimum expiry period of 36 months with 30 months remaining when delivered to the SNS; (7) support a CDC-held IND for contingency use or CDC-held pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission; (8) prior to the end of the contract the therapeutic must be approved or licensed (NDA or BLA) for use as a therapy for neutropenia in adults (age: 18-64 years) exposed to ionizing radiation, (9) The USG reserves an option for safety studies in normal geriatric and pediatric populations; and (10) The USG reserves the right to exercise options to procure up to an additional 100,000 treatment courses.  It is imperative that the Offerors to this RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of their proposals so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices and guidance.

Additional details and requirements will be described in the Acute Radiation Syndrome solicitation, RFP HHS-BARDA-08-10 which will be made available electronically through FEDBIZOPPS on or about March 14, 2008.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.  This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for this solicitation.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number RFP HHS-BARDA-08-10, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  The contract award resulting from this solicitation will have an estimated award date of September 2008.

<DESC>Non-standard GEN II and III Night Vision and Thermal Image Devices <BR><BR>The intent of this announcement is to conduct a market research, this is not a solicitation. This is only an estimate and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any  way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below.  The government is looking to establish a 5 year Multi Award Task Order for the rapid procurement of various non-standard, commercial night vision (Gen 2 & Gen 3) and thermal imagin g devices to fulfill requirements for Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  A list of the devices that are most likely to be procured is shown below.  Due to the unsystematic demand that is characteristic of FMS, a schedule cannot be predicted.  Quantities can ra nge from 10  500 per order.  In-country operator and intermediate maintenance training courses may also be required to support these items.  The purpose of this market survey is to identify sources that can provide these items or equivalents within a rela tively short period of time, i.e., 90 days or less from issuance of a delivery order.  Since these items are being purchased for Foreign Military Sales, the government is looking for items that are below the currently fielded US military standards.  For ex ample, in accordance with Department of State regulations, Image Intensification tubes used in night vision devices are limited to Figures of Merit of 1250 or 1600.  We are interested in your comments about using the MATO vehicle and competition applied to  EACH delivery order.  D/O competition we evaluate more than just lowest price.  <BR> <BR><BR>ACOG 4X32 TA01B SCOPE <BR>AN/AVS-6 AVIATOR'S NV IMAGING SYSTEM<BR>AN/AVS-9 AVIATOR'S NV IMAGING SYSTEM<BR>AN/PAQ-4C INFRARED AIMING LIGHT <BR>AN/PAS-13 THERMAL WE APON SIGHT <BR>AN/PEM-1 LASER BORELIGHT SYSTEM <BR>AN/PEQ-2/2A INFRARED ILLUMINATOR<BR>AN/PEQ-6 LASER AIMING MODULE <BR>AN/PVS-10 DAY/NIGHT SNIPER SIGHT<BR>AN/PVS-14 MONOCULAR NV DEVICE <BR>AN/PVS-23 BINOCULAR NV GOGGLE<BR>AN/PVS-4 NIGHT VISION WEAPON SIGH T <BR>AN/PVS-7 NIGHT VISION GOGGLES <BR>AN/PVS-7D NIGHT VISION GOGGLES<BR>ANV-126-001 NV DEVICE TEST SET<BR>ANV-20/20 INFINITY FOCUS SYSTEM<BR>BUSHNELL ELITE 4200 RIFLE SCOPE <BR>CADET 75 THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA <BR>LEUPOLD MARK 4 16x40MM LR/TM1 RIFLE SCOP <BR>M953 NIGHT VISION BINOCULAR <BR>M955 MINI NIGHT VISION SIGHT<BR>M963 NIGHT VISION GOGGLES <BR>M983 MONOCULAR NIGHT VISION SYSTEM <BR>MARK VII EYESAFE LASER TARGET LOCATOR<BR>MUM-14 MULTI-USE MONOCULAR <BR>MX-10160 Gen 3, 18 mm Image Intensifier Tube <B R>MX-11769 Gen 3, 18 mm Image Intensifier Tube<BR>MX-10130 Gen 3, 18 mm Image Intensifier Tube<BR>PURGE KIT FOR NIGHT VISION GOGGLES<BR>TAM-14 THERMAL ACQUISITION MONOCULAR <BR>TS-4348/UV NV DEVICE TEST SET<BR>WS2154 6X AQUILA WEAPON SIGHT <BR><BR><BR>Any interested sources are encouraged to provide the following information, NLT 24 March 2008, to CECOM LCMC SAMD, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-SA-IEW(Michael Bernicker), Bldg. 1208, Ft.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) has plans to award a follow-on sole-source/Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract for F405 Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) and Engineering Investigations (EI) with Rolls-Royce PLC.  This contract is for CIPs and EIs required to maintain adequate and cost effective operational readiness, safety, and mission effectiveness of the T-45 aircraft propulsion and power systems.  CIP requirements include testing, engineering analysis, technical services and reports.  The purpose of the analysis and testing under CIP is to resolve safety and readiness problems by ensuring design performance requirements are met, redesign low reliability components based on Fleet experiences, forecast hardware wear-out rates; confirm component life limits, identify potential flight safety programs before they occur in the Fleet; and develop design changes and repair procedures where a return-on-investment can be realized. The prospective contract is for FY2009 through FY2013, and will consist of one (1) base year period of performance plus four (4) option years.  Currently, the same support is procured under Contract N00019-04-D-0013, which is a sole-source contract awarded to the same company.  Rolls-Royce PLC is the only source which can provide these services because it is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the F405-RR-401 Adour Engine and Components.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), intends to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type of contract for this acquisition of various parts for the  Fisher & Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 including but not limited to: Post Scales (for weighing assembly), NSN:  6660-00-228-0258, ASN: D111-3SP119,  F&P part number (P/N) 403C00A12 or equivalent; Punch and Die Assembly, NSN:  6625-00-350-3541, ASN:  D111-8A162,  F&P P/N 625A401U01 or equivalent; Lower Case Assembly, NSN:  6660-01-117-7567, ASN:  D111-1A100-2,  F&P P/N 18312 or equivalent; Funnel, NSN:  6660-00-071-0435, ASN:  D111-1SP105, F&P P/N 351C101U01 or equivalent, these parts are used to support the NWS ASOS program.  These parts must be in accordance with (IAW) Fischer & Porter Company, Parts List for Precipitation Gage-Recorder, for series 35B1558 and 35B1559 (attached).   

The Fischer and Porter/Belfort (F&P) weighing rain gage series 35B1558 and 35B1559 was originally manufactured in the early 1980?s for the National Weather Service (NWS).  The F&P consists of two main parts, a rain-collecting pan that will hold a total of about 19.5 inches of rain and an automatic, yet intricate and delicate, weighing and recording mechanism.  Every 15 minutes, a timer activates the recording mechanism and holes are punched into a paper tape (or strip chart) indicating the cumulative amount of collected rainfall to the nearest tenth of an inch using a weight to depth conversion factor.  The paper tape is divided into frames; each individual frame is divided into 24 hour segments.  At the beginning of each month, an observer is tasked with removing the tape and sending it to the local NWS office.  There, it is examined and forwarded to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and publication as official Hourly Precipitation Data.  The F&P (ASN:  D111) is a legacy system in dire need of an upgrade.  This upgrade comes in the form of the Fischer & Porter Upgrade (FPU), in which the existing punch mechanism will be replaced with a digital data recording system.  Until all F&P weighing rain gages can be upgraded at the higher cost FPU, NWS must support the legacy components to sustain the established cooperative network.  Because the F&P weighing rain gage was originally procured from Belfort Instrument Company by part number, they are the only source known to have the drawings and specifications needed to manufacture a part that complies with the F&P Part Numbers as stated herein. 
 
The Government at its discretion may make multiple awards for indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contracts for this equipment, each will cover a five (5) year period.  The Government at its discretion may require first article testing.  The acquisition(s) will be conducted in accordance with the processes set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12.6 ? Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  A solicitation will be issued on or before March 17, 2008 and will be uploaded to the FedBizOpps, the solicitation can also be requested via fax to 816-274-6923, Attn: Carey Marlow or via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov.  The proposal due date and time will be published in the solicitation.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  It will be the responsibility of interested parties to download the solicitation and related documents, and to revisit the site frequently to obtain any updates/amendments to any and all documents.

Description
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to enter into negotiations with the University of Iowa (Attn: Dr. Thomas Peters) for professional consulting services related to designing and conducting Passive Sampling Assessment of Spatial Variability of PM10-2.5 in an Urban Airshed.  Dr. Peters designed and conducted the spatial variability field study in Iowa City that will serve as the model for this proposed EPA field study.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency believes that Dr. Peters has the necessary expertise in the statistical selection of monitoring sites.  In addition, Dr. Peters has developed a passive sampling method that provides results comparable to active filter-based samplers, and this is the only known method that can meet the U.S. EPA's requirements for this effort.     The period of performance is expected to be from the date of award for twelve (12) months to begin during early Spring 2008.     The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541712 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 personnel.     No request for quotation is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.     All interested, responsible, sources must respond within 15 days of the date of this announcement.     Interested vendors shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above and; 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.     If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government an order will be placed with the University of Iowa (Attn: Dr. Thomas Peters).  Response to the U.S. EPA, ATTN: William Goins, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), RTP-POD, ORD Service Center (Mail Code: E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or goins.william@epa.gov.     No telephonic or FAXED requests will be honored.!!!!!

Philippines: Meteorological and Hydrological Telecommunications System Upgrade Feasibility Study.  
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability, to develop a feasibility study to upgrade the Meteorological and Hydrological Telecommunications Systems (MTS) operated by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).  

The Philippines is frequently exposed to meteorological or weather induced hazards given its geographic location.  PAGASA is the government agency responsible for warning the public of impending typhoons, floods and other weather-related hazards affecting the Philippines.  PAGASA has successfully undertaken modernization efforts to improve their operations; however, these past efforts have not addressed their need for comprehensive data/information transmittal.  

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided grant funding to enable PAGASA to hire a U.S. company to identify upgrades for its MTS that satisfy its current and future operational needs.  This upgrade will ensure that real-time data from existing monitoring stations, in the field, are transmitted to the main and regional meteorological centers and received by operation centers to generate forecasting and early warning notices.  The upgrade will also ensure that linkages between other government agencies and disaster coordinating councils are in place, via the planned Philippine government broadband network project.  The proposed feasibility study will provide a comprehensive analysis of the MTS needs, as well as an implementation and financing plan, and most appropriate and reliable system design to link all hydrometeorological observation stations across the country.  

PAGASA is a government agency under the Department of Science and Technology established as the central state institution for meteorology, hydrology, and climatology.  PAGASA provides expert services to state administration bodies and the public.  The major services provided by PAGASA include the provision of weather forecasts and tropical cyclone warnings, flood bulletins and advisories, hydrological, climatological and farm weather forecasts.  PAGASA has been operational for more than 30 years and is engaged in several current modernization activities covering observation, weather, and flood forecast systems.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $381,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

This effort is to procure an additional 600-800 SFW Tactical Munitions Dispenser (TMD) Fuzes with deliveries beginning May 09 and ending NLT August 09.  The current SFW TMD Fuze acquisition strategy is to buy-to-budget to catch up with SFW total production quantities.

The SFW TMD fuze must contain an electronic safe and arm mechanism, explosive components for initiating the TMD cutting network, a thermal battery, and an air pressure measurement assembly.  The TMD fuze must also interface with and provide electrical power to the FZU-39/B proximity sensor and interface with the wind corrected munitions dispenser (WCMD) tail.  The electronic safe and arm mechanism must incorporate two environment sensors, both of which must sense specific critical parameters before arming can be completed.  The TMD fuze with the electronic safe and arm must currently meet all of the safety requirements contained in MIL-STD-1316E and have been approved by the Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB).  The fuze must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze.  This project is considered to be low to medium risk based on safety of flight and integration with existing components.  The contractor must be able to produce a TMD fuze that has been fully qualified and tested according to Specification Number SP20046253, Performance Specification for Tactical Munition Dispenser Fuze at the time of proposal submittal.  The Government does not own a technical data package (TDP) for the TMD fuse, and a technical data package will not be provided by the Government for this effort.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of   FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No RDT&E funds are available for this effort; therefore interested parties must produce or procure for delivery fully qualified fuzes and must submit statements of capability (SOC) or capabilities package addressing the following:  (1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the SFW TMD Fuze requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for the SFW and system safety requirements; (2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble the fuze, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; (3) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of fuzes in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; (4) Ability to deliver fuzes on schedule.  Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package.

Project Description:

This procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at Saufley Field, located in Pensacola, Florida.  The project property is located in Escambia County, Florida which is the most western county in the Florida panhandle.  It is approximately 9 miles Northwest from downtown Pensacola and 12 miles North from Pensacola NAS.  The designated EUL sites at Saufley Field consist of approximately 104.5 acres with 724,000 square feet of improvements.  The primary area is approximately 85.8 acres on the south side of Saufley Field (Site 1). This does not include the adjacent area occupied by a federal minimum-security prison under a memorandum of understanding which the Navy may terminate at its discretion.  The Navy has also offered up a second site, located just south of the perimeter of the installation, that contains approximately 18.7 acres (Site 2) and is currently operated as a 9-hole, pitch-and-putt golf course.  The initial lease term shall not exceed 50 years.  However, the Navy may enter into a succeeding lease of the same or similar term conditioned upon statute, the lessee??s satisfactory performance under the initial lease and if determined by the Navy to be in the Government??s best interest. 

Procurement Process:

The Government intends to award the EUL using a two-phased, best value source selection process.  Specific source selection procedures and evaluation criteria shall be documented in the Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  Among other things, the successful offeror shall:

??	Design and develop the real estate in a manner that is compatible with adjacent Navy uses;
??	Execute, operate, and manage the development consistent with best commercial practices; and
??	Maintain positive relations with local government authorities and the adjacent communities.

Further, the successful offeror shall obtain necessary financing, and plan, operate, and manage the approved development for the term of the lease.  The successful offeror shall provide the Navy cash and/or in-kind consideration not less than the fair market value of the offeror??s leasehold interest in the real property.

 
The Request for Qualifications (RFQ):

A draft Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will be published in FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about February 29, 2008.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.eps.gov. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWC) will hold an Industry Day March 17, 2008 to present and discuss the technologies and methods involved with developing and implementing Active Sonar Training. NUWC is investigating and seeking solutions for developing approaches to active surface ship training shortfalls to support the Surface Warfare Enterprise with respect to Anti-Submarine Training and trainer capabilities. Active Sonar Training solutions comprises a methodology that provides ways to conduct and improve Active Sonar operations in a non-waterborne environment. Solutions should address any or all of the following:

- Improving the sailor's proficiency in Active ASW detection, classification, and localization tracking and engagement of sonar contacts in highly challenging (cluttered, reverberation, multiple interference) acoustic environments
- Training needs to reflect current systems, threats, and Tactics, Training, and Procedures (TTP)
- Tools and Decision Aids for ASW team assessments of Active Sonar Operation which can be utilized among the training stakeholders (i.e. school house, ATGs and integrated trainers)
- An ability to reduce the "Sound in the Water" so than one might practice the routines in port and then be able to get "Quality Training" at sea
- Cost effective solutions that leverage current technologies, as applicable
- Generally focus on Active Sonar Warfighter Skills

Objectives (end state): Single point solutions do not need to explicitly address every objective however any solution should address how the solutions/capability can address the objectives.

- An ASW Trainer Capability That that supports the Active problem
- Provides active ASW proficiency training for mission rehearsal
- Meets elements as defined by 2nd/3rd fleet brief -
   o High Resolution Ocean Environment
   o Accurate Interference Environment
   o Accurate Contact Signature Representation
   o Real-World Non-Acoustic Environment
   o Real-World Acoustic Environment
   o Certified Surface Threat Representation
   o Certified Submarine Threat Representation
   o Certified U.S./Coalition Platform Representation
- Affordability

To brief interested parties, NUWC will host this Industry Day, March 17, 2008 at its Chafee Auditorium, Building 1346. Check-in will start at 8:30AM and the presentations will begin at 9:00AM and end at approximately 12:00PM. The presentation agenda will include an overview and open forum technical discussions and information exchange.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mink Hollow Systems, Inc.,120 Ashton Road, Ashton, MD to provide implementation of the control software for the Reference Microarray Scanner(MAS).  In 2006, Mink Hollow Systems developed the requirements/specification and initial design documents for the control software of the new NIST MAS. Mink Hollow Systems is developing the computer software drivers for controlling the devices in the system.  A substantial portion of these tasks involve their becoming familiar with the hardware components that make up the MAS and their understanding what this complex system is supposed to do and how it should do it.  Should NIST award this new requirement to another vendor, that body of knowledge and understanding that was acquired in the initial phases of the project would be lost and would have to be reacquired by the new vendor.  Not only would this be an additional cost to the new vendor, but it would delay the project and require a substantial investment of additional time by the NIST technical contact and other NIST personnel to bring the new vendor up to speed.  Staff time is currently not available to repeat this necessary educational effort for a new vendor.
Mink Hollow System is located near NIST, so travel for on-site consultations during the performance of this work is not an impediment.  This is essential since extensive collaboration with NIST staff will be required to carry out this work.  Mink Hollow System?s proximity to NIST allows them to be very flexible in their interactions with NIST staff, which makes it much easier to schedule interactions, thereby saving the Government time and maintenance, and testing of the system software will have to be done on-site. The selection of a vendor local to NIST will greatly expedite this process and will result in considerable savings in costs and time to the Government. A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about March 14, 2008 and performance will be through approximately September, 2008.  The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Extensive experience in smoking cessation telephonic interventions that would indicate a high chance of success with patients, many of whom who have smoked for many years 5. Evidence of prior success showing smoking cessation one year quit rates that exceed 20%. Evidence of this success should include counting all smokers who enter counseling in the denominator and those who report being totally tobacco free 1 year later as the numerator (also known as intent to treat). Evidence of success should be available in scientific publications based on randomized controlled trials by authors who conducted investigations with the vendor, such that there is high confidence that the rate of tobacco cessation claimed is accurate and conclusions about the success of the program is valid. 6. Ability and track record of ability to work with a large complex geographically disperse organization 7. Counselors who have competency in providing counseling to economically disadvantaged populations and to a population with high prevalence of racial minorities. 8. A well developed approach and evidence of success in recruiting smokers to make a quit attempt with the assistance of telephonic counseling 9. Willingness to document smoking counseling in the VA electronic medical record system. 10. Ability to track quit rates on an ongoing basis and provides frequent data to the VAPHS regarding the number of enrolled patients and employees, and quit rates during the program, at the end of counseling, and after 1 year.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS BEING POSTED TO CHANGE THE SECONDARY POINT OF CONTACT FROM ELNA BLACK TO SCOTT CURTIS.  THE SYSTEM REQUIRES A RESPONSE DATE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS TYPE OF CHANGE; HOWEVER, NO RESPONSES TO THIS CHANGE NOTICE ARE REQUIRED.

The U.S. Forest Service, Incident Support Branch at the National Interagency Fire Center, in Boise, Idaho, anticipates issuing a Solicitation within the next 15 calendar days for the dry lease (aircraft without fuel, crews, and pilots) for a minimum of ten (10) and a maximum of up to twenty (20) aircraft including complete contractor provided maintenance support.  The aircraft shall be made available thirty days after the date of Contract Award (base period of performance will be from Contract Award through December 31, 2008) with two (2) one year options with periods of performance from January 01, 2009 through December 31, 2009 (Option 1) and January 01, 2010 through December 31, 2010 (Option 2).  The resultant contract will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.
The aircraft will be utilized by the U.S. Forest Service National Aviation Groups for support of Fire and Aviation Management activities.  The solicitation, and the resultant commercial, indefinite quantity type contract, will be awarded for the dry lease of manufacture built, single or multi-engine, turbine powered aircraft.  The successful Contractor shall make the aircraft available for year-round, exclusive use by Federal Government pilots primarily for Aerial Supervision Module (ASM) platforms associated with wildland fire.  Other types of work, to a lesser degree, will be resource management, passenger and cargo transportation, law enforcement, pilot training and proficiency, and administrative activities.   All aircraft offered shall be the same make, model and series.  

The Aerial Supervision mission consists of directing and guiding large air tankers into a fire area, and as necessary, ?leading? them during actual retardant drop(s).  This means operating below 500 feet AGL in steep mountainous terrain in turbulent conditions.  In all cases, the aircraft may have other Government employee/employees on board as an Air Tactical Group Supervisor (ATGS) observer.  Mission/Agency qualified Government pilots will operate all of these aircraft.  The Contractor shall provide the aircraft, complete maintenance of the aircraft, and all oil for the aircraft.  The Government shall provide the pilots and all of the fuel for the aircraft.

During the preproposal conference, some of the sites that will be visited are very remote and difficult to access.  Therefore, all those that plan on attending the conference will need to have either a four-wheel or all-wheel drive  vehicle in order to be able to make it to all of the sites on the schedule.   Those who attend without a four-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicle do so at their own risk, and the government will not be responsible for their travel to/from or attendence at the aforementioned sites.

<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses: QUESTION:  We have a North Carolina Home Care Agency License.  We do not have Medicare Certification or Accreditation.  In the bid it states that you must have "at least Medicare/State certification".  Will our North Carolina Home Care Agency License suffice? ANSWER:  You are eligible if you are certified and/or licensed by medicare or medicaid in North Carolina.   QUESTION:  We are currently accredited by The Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (ACHC). Is this accreditation accepted for this solicitation to provide Homemaker Home Health Aides to the Durham VA?    ANSWER:  This accreditation is pending our acceptance.  A determination will be made at a later date.  Please submit your proposal.  QUESTION:  Do we have to take every case?   ANSWER:  We do expect that some referrals will be rejected with appropriate justification based on specific Home Care Standards, which are also Joint Commission Standards, as listed throughout the Statement of Work (SOW) under the heading, "The Home Health Agency will . . .".  Specifically, as below: 1.     Initial client assessment completed within 3 working days of initial visit or as requested by patient or as requested by patient.   2.     Patient Rights & Responsibilities discussed with patient. 3.     Advance Directives discussed with patient. 4a.   Authorization for care from patient/guardian documented. 4b.

ANSWER:  An amendment will be issued addressing this. QUESTION:  Are we required to meet or exceed minimum wage and fringe in the bid proposal? ANSWER:  Vendor employees must be paid in accordance with the applicable DOL Wage Determination, found on page 31, at a minimum. QUESTION:  Do we have to have each of our references fill out a Past Performance Survey or is this something that you would send to the references after being considered for the award?  The instructions on the Past Performance Survey (pg 43) sound different than the information under Factor II-Past Performance (pg 48).  Please clarify. ANSWER:  Please follow the instructions on page 48 of the solicitation.   QUESTION: What are the discount terms required in form 1449 block 12? ANSWER:  Discount terms are the terms the vendor offers for early payment of their invoice, such as 2% net 10 days. QUESTION:   What is your definition of a "Unit" on block 23 in form 1449? ANSWER:  A unit is an individual, group, structure, or other entity regarded as an elementary structural or functional constituent of a whole, such as each, job, lot, issue, etc.  Block 23, Unit Price, is the quantity times the price.   QUESTION:  Does the incumbent's (Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc.) rate include health and welfare benefits? ANSWER:  No.  However, the contract resulting from this solicitation incorporates the Service Contract Act, so health and welfare benefits must be paid in accordance with the applicable Department of Labor wage determination found on page 31.

<ARCHDATE>04292008
<CONTACT>Marsha K Harrington-Evans Contracting Officer 919-956-5541
<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses: QUESTION:  I was concerned with the shuttle contract posting as "Total Small Business". I read on paragraph 14, page 13 of the contract / solicitation to supply eligibility to "Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business" is marked with an "X".  Is the "TSDVOSB" a requirement to bid? ANSWER:  This solicitation is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses.  Accordingly, (5) (i) 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Aside (June 2003) (15 U.S.C. 644), found on page 12, should be checked in lieu of  (14) 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside (May 2004) (15 U.S.C. 657 f).  An amendment will be issued correcting this error.   QUESTION:  Is this a current contract?   ANSWER:  No. QUESTION:  The solicitation refers to 30 trips per day, is that 30 trips per vehicle or 30 trips combined (all vehicles)? ANSWER:  Thirty (30) trips is the combined total for all vehicles. QUESTION:   What is the actual performance period of the contract? (The solicitation refers to 12 months, and the announcement refers to 6 months and a 4 month option.) ANSWER:  The period of performance is for 12 months.  An amendment will be issued correcting this error.    QUESTION:  Is this a one-time service contract, or will it be an on-going shuttle? ANSWER:  The Government anticipates the need for these services beyond one year. QUESTON:  Can you tell me how much the current contract is for and who is the vendor currently providing the service? ANSWER:  There is no incumbent.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Pursuant to FAR 15.202 Wood Energy Use Services for US Forest Service DOI/NBC/Acquisition Services Directorate - Herndon (AQD-Herndon) will handle this Request for Information.  AQD-Herndon is a Federal Franchise Fund Contracting Office under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act and provides contracting support to all Federal and D0D Agencies.  For an easier to read format of this RFI please go to our website at www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.  INTRODUCTION The US Forest Service Wood Education and Resource Center is seeking firms, if any,  that can provide all the following services in order to work throughout the twenty-state Northeastern Area to help agencies, communities, and businesses evaluate how wood energy can help to meet local energy needs for power, heating, and cooling.  Services to be provided are: 1.	Develop a draft implementation plan for conducting work under this contract. 2.	Finalize this implementation plan with the COTR. 3.	Develop necessary printed and electronic materials to described and publicize the availability of the wood energy assessment service; 4.	Solicit clients for the service using the process described in the above-mentioned implementation plan; 5.	Conduct an interview with each client (on-site or by phone) to generally assess the opportunity for the use of woody biomass for energy at the client's installation; 6.	Arrange for client cost-share collection and transfer of cost share funds to WERC; 7.	Conduct the feasibility assessment of woody biomass as an energy source for the client; 8.	Document the assessment in a formal report presented to the client and COTR; 9.	Provide up to 8 hours of consulting services with clients which who decide to move forward with a wood fueled energy system; 10.	Maintain a database of project analyses and track client project progress for 3 years after the initial analysis for the client; 11.	Provide advice and analytical assistance to the COTR on woody biomass fired energy systems as needed by the COTR; 12.	Work with the Woody Biomass Utilization Awareness Contractor to develop and refine tools for preliminary feasibility analysis; 13.	Work with the Woody Biomass Utilization Awareness Contractor to develop electronic, printed, and web-based information products describing BACKGROUND the use of wood as an energy resource. 14.	Identify gaps in programs and technologies that limit the use of wood energy in projects analyzed by the contractor Woody biomass utilization is a key component of restoring and maintaining ecosystem health. "Woody biomass" is defined as the trees and woody plants, including limbs, tops, needles, leaves, and other woody parts, grown in a forest, woodland, or rangeland environment, that are the by-products of restoration, hazardous fuel reduction treatments (including urban forests), and forest management.  At the national level the Forest Service, through the Woody Biomass Utilization Strategy (http://www.fs.fed.us/woodybiomass/) commits to following three principles to achieve four goals:  Principles	Goals 1. Pursue sustainability.	1.	 Supply 2. Empower entrepreneurial action.	2. Partnerships 3. Use science-based information and new technology	3. Science and Technology 	4. Marketing The new Northeastern Area (NA) strategic plan includes an objective on the sustainable use of forest resources to produce renewable energy and accomplish greenhouse gas reduction.  Objective 2B states: Help the Northeast and Midwest meet its need for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction through the sustainable utilization of woody biomass. The NA Wood Education and Resource Center (WERC) staff, working in cooperation with other Forest Service staff, State Forestry agencies, and other partners, is charged with addressing Objective 2B.  WERC staff with input from NA staff groups and partners has developed a business plan to guide implementation of NA efforts related to the sustainable utilization of woody biomass.  This business plan identifies the need for increased technical assistance to agencies, communities and businesses that are considering the use of wood energy. The use of wood for energy particularly for heating, cooling, process energy, power, and as a fuel for district heating operations all provide opportunities to expand markets for woody biomass.  Support for such technical assistance is consistent with both FS National and Area-wide strategies. PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST Contemplated Requirement:  The Government would like to know what firms can provide all the following services for this requirement by identifying themselves and responding to this RFI.  The Government requests recommendations, comments, concerns, and/or questions relating to the contemplated support services. The Contractor will provide the following services: 1.1.	Develop an annual overall plan and timeline describing how they will accomplish: (1) the scope of work described above and the specific tasks needed to accomplish the goal of having completed 50 wood energy projects analyses in the Northeastern Area at the end of the first contract year and in each subsequent year of the contract; and (2) provide up to 480 hours of technical assistance and analytical support to the COTR on questions related to the implementation of wood energy systems.  This plan will be developed after an initial meeting with WERC staff and COTR to review the scope of work and make sure the contractor understands what is expected.  Finalizing the work plan and timeline may require approximately two (2) additional meetings with the COTR.  Some of the meetings may include representatives of the Northeastern Area Association of State Foresters Utilization and Marketing Committee.  Additional meetings with the Forest Service will be required to identify strategic work items. 1.1.1.	Develop draft information products to be used to publicize the service to be delivered through this procurement.  These information products will be reviewed by the COTR prior to finalizing the products 1.2.	Implement the outreach process to identify clients that are interested in conversion of their energy system to a woody biomass-fired system.  This outreach process will include systems to qualify the clients as to their potential using a wood fired system; the size and use of the wood fired system; the development of a cost-share agreement for moving forward with a more detailed analysis; and a follow-up system to track progress during system analysis and progress on system changes in the following 3 years.   1.3.	Conduct the feasibility analysis.  Depending on the current and future energy needs of the client the wood energy feasibility analysis will include:  1.3.1.

<DESC>UChicago Argonne, LLC an Illinois limited liability company, operator of Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) acting under a prime contract with the U.S. Department of Energy for operation of Argonne National Laboratory is performing a market survey to evaluate obtaining services which are the subject of this Request For Information (RFI).  Argonne currently owns and operates a steam plant that was built in the 1940s and expanded in the early 1960s (for plant comfort heat with minimal process steam and no power generation).

The Laboratory is currently operating a five boiler steam plant that is approaching 60 years old.  Boiler Nos. 1 through 4 were originally designed to fire coal (85,000 pounds per hour) and were converted to natural gas in the 1970s.  Boiler No. 5, has dual fuel capabilities permitted for natural gas and coal (170,000 pounds per hour on natural gas and 110,000 pounds per hour on coal - limited by the emission control equipment) and is limited to 12,000 tons of coal per calendar year.  The limit was self-imposed to avoid becoming a major hazardous pollutant source which would affect the Laboratory as a whole.  The plant header pressure to the campus is 190psig.

All power is purchased off the grid.  The annual electrical load profile is relatively flat and averages 260 million kilowatt hours with peak demands of 43 megawatts.  Laboratory growth and modernization over the next ten years is expected to increase the peak electrical demands to 100-120 Megawatts.  The annual steam generation averages 700 million pounds.  The load profile varies with the seasons and weather patterns; winter steam loads (November through March) average 78 million pounds per month; summer loads (April through October) average 42 million pounds per month.  Present hourly peak steam loads of recent years have peaked at 188,000 pound per hour, but could reach an hourly quantity of 250,000 pounds per hour.  The modernization program may diminish steam loads by an estimated 30%.  It should be noted that these projections are largely dependent on Federal funding.

The chiller systems capacities are as follows:  The Advanced Photon Source (APS) has a total of 9,600 tons; the Central Chilled Water Plant has 4,300 tons, the Building 364 system has 2,200 tons - these are all electrical driven with the exception of one steam 1,500 ton absorber in Building 212. 

Please provide your qualifications for similar Power Plant Projects that generate either full or partial electrical load utilizing "state of the art" technology alternatives, fuel diversification and financing alternatives.  Integrating a "test bed" for the development of advanced and emerging energy technology is also a desirable factor.  Argonne is currently evaluating the option of a developer/designer/builder, owner-operator, which includes maintaining and selling steam and electrical power back to Argonne.

The target for formal presentations is the end of May 2008.  Selected firms will be provided the opportunity to present their qualifications and concepts to the Laboratory.

<SUBJECT>99--AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OPTIMUM TRAINING SOLUTION (ATCOTS)
<SOLNBR>DTFAWA-08-R-00012
<RESPDATE>063008
<CONTACT>Darryl Anderson, (202) 267-7699
<DESC>INITIAL SCREENING REQUEST for AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OPTIMUM TRAINING SOLUTION (ATCOTS) CONTRACT  SIR DTFAWA-08-R-00012 This announcement is the initial Screening Information Request (SIR) in a Two-Step SIR process. The applicable NAICS is 611430: Professional Development Training.  The ATCOTS program seeks to improve the way FAA meets Air Traffic Control (ATC) training needs. Contractor resources are required to provide the scope of services needed to maintain and improve ATC training while the FAA continues to modernize the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet future demands. The attached performance work statement (PWS) establishes the scope of services to be provided by a single contractor under a performance-based contract. The FAA intends to award a performance-based contract service contract to provide lifecycle ATC technical training support as described in the SIR. The pathway to the performance-based contract includes the consolidation of the current FAA field Training Support for Air Traffic (TSAT) contract and the FAA Academy Instructional Support Services (ISS) contract which will provide a contractor a greater ability to holistically examine the entire air traffic controller training lifecycle. This approach enables the contractor to better integrate training activities throughout the training cycle and to suggest ways to improve the training process. Additionally, changes to the ATC training environment can be developed and implemented effectively through discrete process improvement proposals.   SIR Process: The FAA will perform a two step process for selecting the successful ATCOTS contractor. In response to the initial SIR, interested offerors must provide information that demonstrates their capability and experience to perform the services described in the SIR.  The information provided must be relevant in size, scope, and complexity to the ATCOTS requirements. Interested offerors should refer to Sections L.5 AND L.6 of the SIR. The FAA will evaluate the responses to the initial SIR and select the offerors most likely to receive award. Only those offerors remaining after the down-select decision will be permitted to participate in the second step of the SIR process. The FAA intends to make a down-select decision based on the information contained in Volumes I and II in Section L. The FAA will request detailed proposals from the remaining offerors that must comply with the submission and delivery instructions for Volumes III - VII in Section L. SIR Description and Instructions: Interested offerors shall find that the solicitation provided in this initial screening request omits specific sections of the SIR. The FAA intends to make the full SIR Request for Offer (RFO) only available to the down-selected offerors. The SIR provides a path for migration to a performance-based contract. After the down-select decision, remaining offerors may be invited to propose a "pilot program" for one or more key training sites for the FAA to validate innovations in this portion of the awarded contract.  Parameters for the pilot program will be supplied with the RFO materials.  Additionally, offerors will propose acceptable performance levels, metrics and weights in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) document that the FAA would evaluate for award and then use post-award as a subset of information upon which to base fee incentive decisions. The FAA recognizes that some of the attached documents reference attachments and/or data that may not have been provided in this initial SIR release. However, for those sections that have not been provided, the FAA has provided additional information so that interested offerors may anticipate and formulate expectations for decision and planning purposes. For example, this announcement contains representative site data which may assist offerors in better understanding subsets of the FAA training environment.  Due to the wide range of types of sites and fluctuations in numbers of students, at different stages of training, this is not an exhaustive presentation. The PWS portrays, and the awardee will have to perform, a much broader range of training. The FAA may be posting additional data - the timing or quantity of that posting will not be grounds for extending proposal deadlines. As another example, Section B has not been provided with this initial SIR because the FAA needs to validate and complete the data and requirements that will be provided to the offerors to develop their cost/price proposals. This data could impact pricing assumptions and structure, award/incentive decisions, and could ultimately affect the offeror's pricing methodology for the scope of services needed.  In addition to the attachments provided in this announcement, the following links to the FAA's Air Traffic Technical Training Order 3120.4L and the FAA's Workplan for the Air Traffic Controller Workforce is provided for information purposes only.  3120.4L http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications/at_orders/media/TRN.pdf Workplan http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/controller_staffing/media/CWFP_final2007.pdf The FAA is planning to award a hybrid contract. Based on market survey responses, the FAA intends to award a Cost Reimbursable type contract with provisions for incentives or award fees or a combination of both. The FAA contemplates a 10 year period of performance for the anticipated ATCOTS contract. Offeror's responses to the first step of the process must be submitted and delivered in compliance with Section L.3 of the SIR to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ATTN: Darryl Anderson, Contracting Officer, AJA-48 Room 406 800 Independence Ave. SW Washington, DC 20591 Proposals Volumes I-II must be submitted to the address above no later than Monday, March 17, 2008 at 3:00pm Eastern Daylight Time.  Proposals received after the specified time will not be considered. Refer to Section L.3.3 for additional guidance.

The 99th Contracting Squadron/LGCB is conducting market research to seek qualified sources capable of performing tasks in support of the 414th Combat Training Squadron.  This support shall cover all training and testing operations which utilize the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS)/Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS) and operations with the Combined Air Operations Center ? Nellis (CAOC-N).  These operations include but are not limited to RED FLAG (RF) and MAPLE FLAG (MF) exercises, USAF Weapons School Mission Employment (ME) phase, Joint Expeditionary Forces Experiment (JEFX), ANGEL THUNDER and other special training/testing missions.  RF exercises, conducted at Nellis AFB, NV, provide Large Force Exercise (LFE) advanced tactical training for multinational forces.  RF exercises are typically conducted five times per year, are two weeks long, contain two missions per day (normally one day and one night ?go?) and comprise 500 to 1500 sorties.  MF exercises are similar to RF exercises but conducted at Canadian Forces Base, Cold Lake Alberta, Canada.  They are typically conducted three times per year, are four to six weeks long, contain two missions per day and comprise 500-1000 sorties.  For both exercises, separate morning, afternoon and nighttime operations may be conducted during any particular period.  An Air Tasking Order (ATO) is published for each exercise day that directs the missions, objectives and targets for each unit as part of the integrated force. During execution, mission data is transmitted live and recorded from exercise aircraft/equipment, and received/processed by 98th Range Wing (98 RANW) computer systems for real-time mission control and use in mission debriefings.  Recorded data will require post-mission merging.  Post-mission, the ATO results in the generation of several aircrew debriefing products to include: graphic flight path tracks for each aircraft; weapons employment ?shot? evaluations (air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-to-air shot and Electronic Warfare (EW)); survivability analysis; aggressor tactics and other related data.  In support of these exercises, the 68th Electronic Warfare Squadron (68 EWS) at Eglin AFB, FL is tasked by Air Combat Command (ACC) through the USAF Warfare Center (USAFWC) to be the focal point to manage EW training, testing, tactics development and engineering.  The 68 EWS provides specialized expertise and assistance in conducting EW/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) operations during composite force training exercises at Nellis AFB, NV.  During each exercise the contractor shall support aircrew package debriefs (normally two to three) and a mass aircrew debrief for every mission.  Debrief data for both RF and MF will be inputted into and maintained in a database to allow analysis of aggregate historical data concerning the capabilities and strategies utilized in tactical air operations.  The contractor shall provide data retrievals as requested by the 414 CTS staff to support any requests within the scope of the contract.  Normal duty hours are 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday, but staggered, flex-time and delayed shifts as well as some weekend support may be required to support nighttime missions, support unique mission requirements and to provide timely documentation.  The contractor shall use such scheduling techniques to avoid using overtime to the maximum extent possible.  During exercise execution, the contractor shall provide up to 16 hours of continuous mission support in accordance with daily flying and briefing/debriefing schedules as published by the Government.  When required to meet increased mission requirements, the Government reserves the right to augment contractor key entry technicians with military and/or civilian personnel.  The contract support responsibilities will be generally divided into two categories:  basic data processing/analysis and surge (as required for mission accomplishment) requirements.  The contractor shall: review and update exercise plans/visual aids; support professional quality product preparation; ensure exercise data is transmitted, stored and available for the creation of aircrew debriefing and historical archival products; conduct, document and publish exercise participant satisfaction interviews; accomplish daily system file backups; provide an automated means to collect security data; and maintain and provide reference services for the RF Technical Library.  Most personnel categories require a bachelor degree and/or experience in specific disciplines (i.e. Contract Manager/Senior Analyst, Senior Programmer/Analyst, Technical Senior Analyst (TSA), etc).  The contractor is required to have a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance and must have or be eligible to receive Special Access Program (SAP) status at the performance start date (tentatively set for 1 Oct 2008).  Interested small businesses that are certified and qualified (in accordance with 13 CFR parts 125.8 through 125.12, and FAR Part 19.307) as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern in NAICS code 541513 with a size standard of $23 million are encouraged to submit their capability packages outlining their experience in the aforementioned key areas and tasks.

The Department?s goal with this System is to address the functional, operational, and financial implications of conducting training and maintenance for four separate primary visa systems as well as to strategically transform and modernize State?s visa processing environment by providing consolidated, person-centric visa data. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.  Responses are due to this RFI by 3:00 PM on Wednesday, April 9, 2008.  See sections 5.0 and 6.0 for further information. All questions for Industry Day may be submitted by sending an e-mail to the AQM POC no later than Wednesday, March 12, 2008. No questions received after that date will be answered unless the Government determines the answer to the question imparts information material to Industry?s ability to respond to the RFI. Government responses to questions will be made available.  The CVS draft solicitation CVSRFI1044A has been posted via http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  In order to access technical drawings of the systems contractors must be registered at http://www.FedTeDS.gov.   Contact Information:  If you have any questions regarding this RFI notice or draft solicitation, please contact:  STEWARTJ@state.gov via email only.  No telephone questions will be accepted.  All questions shall be in writing addressed to the above email address.  Jo-Ann Stewart, Contract Specialist, and Phone:  703-875-6646, Fax:  703-875-6085.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE, 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, OR UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETION . ALL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.

Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues. The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents. 

Pentetate (diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) calcium trisodium (Ca-DTPA) and pentetate (diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) zinc trisodium (Zn-DTPA) have been shown to be effective in treating internal contamination with radionuclides such as plutonium, americium, or curium. DTPA increases the rates of elimination of these substances from the body through the exchange of calcium or zinc ions with the transuranium element. The transuranium-DTPA complex is stable and is excreted in urine. The calcium salt is 10X more effective than the zinc salt of DTPA in the first 24 hours following internal contamination, but after 24 hours, the salts are similarly effective. 

DTPA has been available for distribution from the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site under an IND and formulations of Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA suitable for intravenous administration, or inhalation via nebulizer, were approved by the FDA in August 2004. Oral formulations of DTPA would be more easily administered than the injectable formulations, making DTPA easier to use in a mass casualty situation; however, DTPA is poorly absorbed when administered by these routes. The NIAID is interested in furthering the development of alternative formulations of DTPA that have enhanced oral bioavailability, and the capability to decorporate systemic transuranic compounds.

The Offeror will have a lead native DTPA (Ca and/or Zn) formulation that includes absorption enhancers and that has been shown to have enhanced DTPA oral bioavailability compared to the licensed formulation, and has been shown to decorporate a systemic transuranic compound in animals. The Offeror will provide the following by itself or through subcontract: assays in place to measure DTPA levels in biological fluids, pharmacology and toxicology capabilities to evaluate DTPA and transuranic radionuclide pharmacokinetics and safety of the formulated product, efficacy evaluation animal models, and radionuclide exposure facilities. 

Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals. Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy. The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

Organizations that have a lead DTPA oral formulation candidate and current capabilities in the following areas are invited to submit a capability statement to the NIAID. Requirements include: 

Oral bioavailability and radionuclide (transuranic) decorporation data for a lead candidate (DTPA formulated with absorption enhancers)

Radionuclide resources including a range of pertinent radionuclides (transuranics)

Facilities for storage and disposal of radionuclides and contaminated waste 

Animal facilities for rodents and for housing and care of radionuclide contaminated animals 

Laboratories for all analyses and radionuclide measurements 

Instrumentation and equipment for laboratory, animal tissue, and radionuclide measurements 

Laboratories for radionuclide administration by injection

Licenses and accreditations 

Staff trained and experienced in projected studies. Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the Offerors? qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following:

cGMP synthesis and product manufacturing capabilities, including stability studies

Efficacy evaluation of radionuclide decorporation agents in animal models predictive of human responses 

Optimization studies for candidate decorporation agents (dose, schedule of administration) 

Radionuclide pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies following intravenous administration 

Safety pharmacology studies in animal models 

Personnel/Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity.

Past Performance: Past performance is considered essential. In addition to demonstrating that they have met the above qualifications, interested parties must identify at least three other projects of similar size and complexity.

All capable organizations are encouraged to submit capability statements based on this announcement.

Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. Please limit responses to 5 pages. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 4:00 P.M., local time on March 21, 2008.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), University Drive C Division, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 with Sun Nuclear, 425A Pineda Court, Melbourne, FL 32940-7508 for MapCheck IMRT Q/A system.   This system includes:  (1) 445 Channel 2D array, complete PC software for importing and automatic verification of patient plans from computerized treatment planning systems, advanced film analysis, alignment and film template, 25 meter power-data cable, serial cable, power supply (110/220v) and 1 year software maintenance.  (2) Isocentric mounting fixture - Sturdy Gantry fixture holds MapCheck or Profiler 2 or Daily QA 3 Detector Planes at 100cm SDD.  Mounts Securely to LINAC accessory tray.  Holds solid water up to 10cm depth. This system is needed for an innovative technique known as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT).  This technique requires verification of the radiation dose distribution of the prescribed treatment plan for each patient prior to treatment.  Analysis of the measured and planned dose is performed within the MapCheck software by importing a dose map file from the treatment planning system.  MapCheck software is fast and efficient, therefore, making comparison criteria easy to adjust and readily available.  By using the smallest available detectors, MapCheck is qualified to precisely measure steep dose gradients and small fields.  Because IMRT beams are collections of small fields and steep dose gradients, Mapcheck becomes the critical choice for QA verification.  The MapCheck system uses a large number of diodes which gives instant readings eliminating the need for further processing.  The MapCheck process is more efficient because there is no conversion needed for electronic formatting.  Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the contracting officer, in writing, no later than 4:00pm EST 3/7/08.  Such notification must include a complete description of proposed equipment including narrative and specifications, and must demonstrate that it meets or exceeds the capabilities described above.  Notification shall be mailed to Cheryl Ebert, Contracting Officer (90C-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh PA  15206.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the contracting officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>N -- Emergency/Radio Equipment Install and Removal
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with Motorola Inc., on a sole source basis, to remove and install Government emergency radio equipment on leased vehicles.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.  The anticipated contract period will be for one year from date of award.

The Office of Investigations (OI) has implemented a plan to exchange their GSA leased vehicles with a monthly lease rate of $250 - $350 for vehicles with a lease rate of $170 - $190.  Every vehicle leased to OI is equipped with law enforcement emergency lights, siren and radio equipment.  Before a vehicle can be returned the radio and emergency equipment must be removed.  Upon receipt of the new vehicle, the equipment must be re-installed in the replacement vehicle.  

Motorola Inc. can be considered the only responsible source due to their unique capabilities to serve OI field offices across the country.  OI has 86 offices around the country where agents and vehicles are located.  Most of these regional and field offices are located in close proximity to the more then 250 Motorola Service Stations (MSS).

<SUBJECT>B -- Independent Evaluators
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE TO:  vendors capable of providing the services of an Independent Evaluator (IE) as discussed below -- THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS POSTING.

INTRODUCTION:  The Social Security Administration (SSA) anticipates awarding a 3-year, single award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to a vendor capable of providing the services of an Independent Evaluator (IE).  IE services will include pre-award and post-award evaluations of occupational information and methodology employed by private-sector entities to produce an occupational information product that revises and updates the Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT), published by the Department of Labor (DOL).  Pre-award IE evaluation services will consist of the evaluation of technical proposals and affiliated documentation submitted in response to SSA's Request for Proposals (RFP).  Post-award IE services will consist of an extensive evaluation of SSA's selected subscription contractor's occupational information and evaluation of information updates as required.  SSA's requirements are further delineated in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).

FYI - Under a separate action, SSA is concurrently seeking, from an unrelated private-sector entity, access to a subscription for an electronic publication that will provide SSA with updated and revised DOT-based occupational information for use as a replacement for the DOT in SSA's disability evaluation process. Before SSA can use this private-sector information, SSA must know if the data is statistically valid, reliable, accurate, verifiable, reproducible, and defensible for use in its disability evaluation process. 

If you feel your organization possesses the capability and expertise for performing the above type of service, please provide the following information about your company:

1.	Company name, address, email address, website address, and point of contact; 
2.	GSA FSS contract number if available; 
3.	Does your company have experience evaluating technical proposals for Government entities?  If yes, briefly explain; 
4.	Does your company have experience evaluating occupational or similar information?  If yes, briefly explain;
5.	Does your company have experience evaluating private-sector information similar to that described in the SOW for statistical validity and accuracy?  If yes, briefly explain.    

Although SSA would prefer demonstrated experience specifically evaluating occupational information, SSA recognizes that offerors may not have this specific experience.  Therefore, SSA will consider similar experience evaluating technical proposals for Government entities and similar experience evaluating private-sector information for statistic validity and accuracy.  

In addition, SSA is seeking industry comments on the viability and comprehensiveness of its SOW.  Please provide comments regarding the SOW based on the following:

1.	  Are there any concerns or areas of uncertainty, which in your opinion, require clarification or correction?
2.	  Are SSA's requirements clear and explicable?  Do you have any suggestions for improving the SOW?
3.	  Through a separate subscription for an electronic publication RFI as described in paragraph 2 above, SSA will provide the draft Statement of Work. The anticipated BPA described within this RFI will require the IE to evaluate subscription offeror?s technical proposals, affiliated documentation (to further support offeror's contention that its informational product is viable) and its occupational information products. Does your company have any recommendations for the types of written documentation to be submitted by the subscription offeror that will best assist SSA and the IE in its technical evaluations?
4.	   Do you have any concerns or questions regarding the subscription offeror's RFI?

SSA anticipates issuing a Request for Quotation for the services described above around April, 2008 and awarding a single BPA within approximately 60 days thereafter.  
 
This RFI is not a solicitation and does not constitute a request for quotation or proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is strictly for determining capable sources for market research purposes only and for incorporating industry comments into the SOW.  Submission of any information based on this RFI is purely voluntary.  

Please submit your response directly to Robert Pfaff via email at robert.pfaff@ssa.gov .

<SUBJECT>Y--DUCT CLEANING BUILDING #1, PROJECT NUMBER 540-07-607
<DESC>Clarification for Solicitation VA-244-08-RP-0116 	The following items were discussed at the pre-proposal site visit held at the Louis A Johnson, VA Medical Center, Clarksburg, WV on February 22, 2008 and are provided here as clarification to assist contractors prepare proposals. 	Solicitation is for the duct cleaning of the whole Medical Center Building 	After discussion with the vendors present the Contracting Officer decided the BID BOND was cost prohibitive for many of the SDVOSB and eliminated that requirement from this solicitation. 	Testing required by engineers consists of Air Test only, one ambient air to provide baseline.  One supply side and one return test to verify completed areas or three per system.  No exhaust testing will be required.  	Access door installation is preferred to bore and patch to facilitate future duct cleaning and maintenance.  Drawings will be required to show the installation locations. 	Comparison before and after photos will be with location markings will be used to visually inspect cleaning and assess duct condition by engineering section. 	Fan coils approximate 30 units are included in the cleaning of duct runs.  	Several areas were identified as sensitive and will require strict coordination to access.  This includes the Pharmacy, 6th floor, ER, OR suite, ICU unit and other areas as identified by engineering section.  All total these areas are approximately 50% of the project.  Many will require after hours access only and scheduling of shut downs and restarts will be strictly enforced. 	Drain pans may require resealing.  Line item pricing for pan Crete or like item priced per sq. ft. is requested separately. 	If 120 days is not acceptable, please list set time on proposal. 	Proposals will be accepted via e-mail until the advertised date and time of the solicitation.  Proposals will not be accepted by fax due to poor quality and past problems in reading documents.  Proposals may be mailed but should be received prior to the advertised time. 	Davis / Beacon wage for Harrison County should be done by federal labor wage guidelines since it is a federally funded facility.  According to the West Virginia Division of Labor, there is no category for duct cleaning or janitorial under the West Virginia Division of Labor.  The Federal Department of Labor does identify a Ventilation Equipment Tender occupation code 25190 (install access) and Janitor code of 11150 (general cleaner)

7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.
(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).

(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium:

(f)	9.1
(g)	5.1
(h)	5.2
(i)	12.1
(j)	7.1
(k)	11.4


2. Paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section are different from WCAG 1.0.

WCAG 1.0 is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505.

? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge. 
(b) End-users shall have access to a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of products in alternate formats or alternate methods upon request, at no additional charge.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

OVERVIEW:

The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Habitat Conversation (OHC) seeks data collection and analysis support to evaluate portions of the NMFS essential fish habitat consultation process.  This work is needed during early-mid 2008.



PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

1996 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conversation and Management Act (MSA) mandated that essential fish habitat (EFH) be identified and protected.  To this end, MSA also requires federal agencies to consult with NMFS when their actions may adversely impact EFH.  Specifically, the MSA requires that NMFS provides conservation recommendations to federal agencies which take actions that would adversely affect EFH and that those federal agencies provide a written response to NMFS? recommendations within 30 days.  The consultation process is further described in the EFH regulatory guidelines (50 CFR 600.905-930).

NMFS seeks to evaluate the EFH consultation process in order to improve the degree to which NMFS conservation recommendations are accepted by federal agencies.  Our goal is to improve the effectiveness of the EFH consultation process.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which has jurisdiction over projects that affect navigation in federal waters, requests more EFH consultations nationally than any other single federal agency.  To make data collection more manageable and analysis less subject to differences between action agencies, this evaluation will be limited to consultations requested by USACE in FY06 and FY07.  The number of consultations analyzed will be determined using a representative sampling method that achieves the greatest degree of statistical significance with the least amount of demands placed on NMFS staff.  

It is anticipated the NMFS regional office staff will locate, copy and mail the majority of relevant EFH consultations to the contractor for analysis.  Travel may be required to complete the data collection process within NMFS offices or USACE districts in each region.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS:

The primary objective of this project is to learn the degree to which NMFS EFH conservation recommendations are included in USACE permits and the reasons for lack of inclusion if applicable.  To achieve these objectives, the contractor will complete the following tasks:

1.	 Working with NMFS regional office staff as needed, gather the following information about each consultation selected to be part of this assessment:
a)	Letter containing EFH conservation recommendations provided to USACE.
b)	USACE responses to EFH consultations (these may be permits, public notices, correspondence or other forms of communication), including explanations of why USACE did not incorporate NMFS EFH recommendations.
2.	If necessary, travel to NMFS regional office to gather information.
3.	Conduct quantitative analysis on EFH consultations to answer the following questions:
a)	How many conservation recommendations were provided by NMFS during the consultation?
b)	How many conservation recommendations were included in the corresponding USACE permit?
c)	Did the USACE explain why conservation recommendations were not included for a given permit?
d)	What is the rate of inclusion of conservation recommendations nationally, for each NMFS region, and for each USACE District?
4.	For a small subset of the consultations collected, qualitatively assess the content of the consultation compared to the USACE permits to determine patterns in acceptance of EFH Conservation Recommendations (CR) (e.g. Did preconsultations occur?  Were best management practices used?  Is the programmatic consultation in place?) and the degree of which the NMFS CRs were accepted (e.g. verbatim inclusion in the permit, minor modification, or significant modification).
5.	Prepare final report of data analysis.

DELIVERABLES:

1.	August 1, 2008:  Annotated outline of final report.
2.	September 30, 2008:  Submit Final Report to NMFS Office of Habitat Conservation (Electronic file in MS Word format and 30 bound hard copies).

TIMELINE:

April 2008:  Contract awarded.
April-May 2008:  Data Collection.
June-August 2008:  Analysis and Report Generation.
September 2008:  Submit Final Report to NMFS Office of Habitat Conservation (electronic file and hard copies).

OPERATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS:

Work performed by the contractor will require periodic coordination with the NMFS regional office and/or NMFS Office of Habitat Conservation headquarters staff in Silver Spring, Maryland.  Coordination will take place through a combination of email discussion, teleconference, and in-person meetings (with regional office staff), as necessary.  The contractor will provide monthly progress reports to the Program contacts, which will include an accounting of time spent with regional staff.

IT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:

The Certification and Accreditation Requirements for the Department of Commerce clause 1352.239-73 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.


NOTE:  THE ABOVE ARE MIMUMUM REQUIREMENTS.

Attachment Brand Name Justification: 
Statutory Authority. Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-(1)(c).

Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited. The items under this justification are peculiar to two manufacturers, Sony and Fujinon. AFIT camera equipment has met its life cycle of 5 years and several configuration specific items are in need of an upgrade. At the current time, AFIT has no critical spares on hand. Sony and Fujinon are the only known brands that can meet the current configuration and meet the government requirement without procuring additional equipment. Buying any other brands would result in the government replacing the existing infrastructure at an additional cost of approximately $60,651.20 to include man hours, and possibly more due to training.

The solicitation number for this procurement is FA4803-07-Q-A248 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
SOL NR: FA4803-08-Q-A097
 


I.  Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity:  HQ USCENTAF/A7-CE and 20th Contracting Squadron, Shaw AFB, SC 29152-2610.  

II. Nature and/or Description of Action:  A firm fixed price Purchase Order issued to purchase 4 protective bomb suits in support of operations within HQ USCENTAF?s Area of Responsibility (AOR).      

III. Description of Supplies/Services:  This purchase is to include four EOD-9 Bomb Suits and equipment.  The order will consist of the following: four helmet?s, four visor kit?s / breathing apparatus, two small explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) suit, two large EOD suits, two hand protectors with gloves (size 7) , two hand protectors with gloves (size 11),  three suit spare part kit?s, fifty anti fog EOD Visors and four visor steel?s.

IV. Identification of Statutory Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c), ?Application for Brand Name Descriptions.?  

V.  Applicability of Authority:  EOD-9 Bomb Suit which is the only EOD bomb suit approved for use by the United States Air Force.  Med-Eng Systems currently provides Explosive Ordinance Disposal protective suits and equipment to the United States Air Force (USAF) as well as other Department of Defense components.  This equipment will be deployed to the Southwest Asia (SWA) Area of Responsibility (AOR).  As required in FAR 6.302-1(c), the agency head has determined that the acquisition is essential to the Government?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  Therefore, the nature of this acquisition is authorized IAW FAR 6.302-1(c). 

VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This requirement will be solicited as a brand name requirement and posted on federal Business Opportunity for competition.

VII. Market Research:  Market research was conducted using the SBA Pro Net Search.  Of the 290 contractors under NAICS code 339113 Med Eng Systems is the only authorized manufacture of the EOD 9 ensemble.

VIII.  Other facts supporting other than full and open competition:  As stated in paragraphs V, VI, and VII above, no other manufactures are able to provide the EOD 9 ensemble.  The use of the EOD 9 ensemble saves Airmen?s lives on a daily basis and is crucial for EOD teams to be successful in the Counter (IED) Improvised Explosive Device effort.  Without these capabilities, the security and safety of deployed USCENTAF and Coalition Forces personnel will be severely degraded.  This will certainly result in undue risk accepted to accomplish an already hazardous mission.  On average, each EOD team that is outfitted with the EOD 9 suit performs 1.5 missions per day ?Outside-the-Wire.?  The EOD 9 ensemble is the last line of defense against a determined insurgency that is targeting EOD Airmen. This is a follow-on contract to purchase equipment to match already existing  bomb suits in the AOR.

IX.  Listing of Sources:  Med-Eng Systems is a small business manufacturer:

Med-Eng Systems Inc.
835 Commerce Park Drive
            Ogdensburg, NY 13669-2209

X.  Statement of the Actions to Remove Competitive Barriers.  At this time there are no actions in progress to remove the competitive barriers on subsequent acquisitions.   No other source is known to manufacturer EOD protective equipment that meets Air Force Standards.  However, we will continue to research for such sources.

XI.  Contracting Officer?s Certification:   ?I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete.? 

XII. Technical/Requirements Certification.  The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified as complete and accurate by the appropriate management level of the technical/requirements organization.

This requirement will  include: Item 0001 - 4 ea EOD 9A Helmet Desert Tan Drab, Part # MA005130, Item 0002 - 4 ea EOD 9 BA Visor Kit EOD 9 Breathing Apparatus Package, part # MA005130, Item 0003 - 2 ea Suit EOD 9 Mob Tan Small C/W SAPI PCKT, Part # 21307-5, Item 0004 ? 4 ea Visor Steel EOD9, Item 0005 ? 2 ea Suit EOD 9 Desert Tan Large C/W SAPI PCKT , Part # 21307-8, Item 0006 ? 2 ea Hand Protectors With Gloves size (7) Pair, Part # 910-017, Item 0007 ? 2 ea Hand Protectors With Gloves size (11) Pair, Part # 910-025, Item 0008 ? 50 ea Ant Fog Applique EOD Visor.

III. ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

In addition to the terms and conditions noted above and in the clauses incorporated by reference, the following
terms and conditions shall also be included in any resultant contract:

1. DELIVERIES. All deliveries shall be made on the day specified in the delivery order unless otherwise authorized
by the receiving activity during normal working hours of such activity, provided that the Contractor shall have
received the order at least 48 hours prior to the day so specified.

2. QUANTITY DETERMINATION. At the Government's option, quantity may be determined at the receiving
activity on the basis of-
(a) Weight, using calibrated scales; or
(b) A calibrated meter on the receiving tank system.
If the Government does not elect to use one of the methods in (a) or (b) above, the quantity
shall be determined (at the Contractor's option) on the basis of--
(a) Calibrated meter;
(b) Certified capacity tables. The tables must be made available at the time of delivery;
(c) Certified tank calibration markers. Certified tank calibration markers will not be accepted unless the
conveyance is full to the marker and the entire quantity is delivered; or
(d) The net quantity determined at the loading point by a calibrated loading rack meter or calibrated
scales. This quantity must be mechanically imprinted on the loading rack meter ticket that is generated by the
loading rack meter or calibrated scales. If this method is used, the Government reserves the right to redetermine the
quantity received at time of delivery by gauging the receiving tank before and after delivery.

3. WATER BOTTOMS. (a) Every delivery must be free of all water bottoms prior to discharge; and (b) The
Contractor is responsible for their removal and disposal.

4. VOLUME CORRECTION. Volume correction to gallons at 60?F (or liters at 15 degrees Celsius) is required for
all volumes of measured in tank trucks, trucks and trailers and tank wagons which are in excess of 5,000 gallons.

5. MEASUREMENT STANDARDS. All measurements and calibrations made to determine quantity shall be in
accordance with the most recent edition of the API Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards (MPMS) Outside
the US, other technically equivalent national or international standards may be used. Certified capacity tables shall
mean capacity tables prepared by an independent inspector or any independent surveyor. (1) Volume XII, Table
52, shall be used to convert cubic meters at 15OC to barrels of 60?F. Convert liters at 15OC to cubic meters at 15OC
by dividing by 1,000. Convert gallons at 60?F to barrels at 60?F by dividing by 42. Should foreign law restrict
conversion by this method, the method required by law shall be used.
(2) If the original measurement is by weight and quantity is required in U.S. gallons, then--.(A) Volume XII, Table
58, shall be used to convert metric tons to U.S. gallons at 60?F. (3) API MPMS, Chapter 4, Proving Systems.
All meters used in determining product volume shall be calibrated using this standard with the frequency required by
local regulation (foreign or domestic). If no local regulation exists, then the frequency of calibration shall be that
recommended by the meter manufacturer or every 6 months, whichever is more frequent.

6. INVOICING AND PAYMENT. (A) Overbillings--(a) That are less than or equal to 0.5 percent of the quantity
listed on the receiving document will be paid as originally invoiced by the Contractor when the overbilled quantity is
solely a result of a difference in measurement techniques. (b) That exceed 0.5 percent of the quantity listed on the
receiving document will be paid based on the corrected quantity as determined by the activity and annotated on the
activity's receiving document. (B) Underbillings will be paid as invoiced. (C) Notwithstanding any permissible
variation percentage, payment is authorized for a percentage not to exceed 120 percent of the ordered quantity.
Payment shall be made for quantity within this allowable variation listed on the receiving document as received and
accepted by the activity and invoiced by the Contractor.

7. VARIATION IN QUANTITY. A variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will not be accepted
unless the variation has been caused by conditions of loading, shipping or packing, or allowances in manufacturing
processes, and then only to the extent, if any, specified. The permissible variation shall be limited to a 10 percent
increase/decrease. This increase or decrease shall apply to each delivery order.
