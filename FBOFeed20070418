<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services intends to award a Sole Source purchase order using small purchase procedures for Helicopter services to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Aviation Services, Box 2, RR #!, 475 Airport Road, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario P6A 5K6, Canada to participate in the annual Waterfowl Breeding Pair Population Survey.  This survey is conducted to fulfill the United States's obligations toward International Mingratory Bird Treaty Act.  Waterfowl breeding populations will be surveyed within Ontario, Quebec and Labrador Canada to count waterfowl and collect  data.   Flights will be dependent on weather and waterfowl phenology.  Because the Ontarior Ministry of Natural Resourcs is a cooperative  governemnt agency, their helicopters are able to access jet fuel caches which are reserved for Government aircraft in remote areas. The helicopter flights are to be conducted in Stratum 51 in Ontario and Strata 68 and 69 in Quebec and Labrador Canada to obtain visibility correction data in conjuction with the Black Duck Joint Venture Fixed-wing Waterfowl Breeding Population Survey and to collect video for a training video.  The survey and identification project require maneuvering the helicopter at the edge of the performance envelope in a variety of remote wilderness habitats in nortern Canada.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Sue Handy, 202-493-5942
<DESC>This is a Request for Comment for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program. We are soliciting comments from industry regarding our technical requirements and architecture. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Offer (RFO).  The FAA is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.  We will not pay for any costs associated with responding to this RFC.  All costs associated with the RFC submission will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Today's National Airspace System (NAS) comprises systems developed over time for specific purposes. The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) relies upon a new decision construct, bringing more systems, customers, and service providers into the process. Timely data will be needed at more places, for more purposes, and in common formats to ensure consistent use. Today's hard-wired infrastructure cannot readily support this evolution. These new "data customers" need to be provided the governance and policy that tells them how to connect to existing, open interfaces instead of having to design, develop, test, implement, and maintain new ones at great expense.  This situation represents a performance gap that must be bridged for NGATS to be successful. The System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program will close this performance gap by providing a secure NAS-wide information web to connect FAA systems to each other, and enable interaction with other members of the decision making community including other agencies, air navigation service providers, and airspace users. SWIM will provide policies, standards, and core services to support data management.   SWIM will leverage existing systems and networks to the extent practicable and use proven technologies to reduce cost and risk. SWIM will be developed incrementally based upon the needs of various data communities, maturity of concepts of use, and segments that are right-sized to fit reasonable cost, schedule, and risk thresholds. SWIM Segment 1 (FY 2009-2013) is envisioned to include capabilities such as publishing Special Use Airspace (SUA), surface position data, Corridor Integrated Weather System (CIWS) and Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS) data to NAS users, providing the Traffic Flow Management (TFM) Flow Object, capturing and publishing Pilot Reports (PIREPs) to controllers, among others.  The Segment 1 capabilities will not be finalized until the Final Investment Decision scheduled for June 2007. See attachments

A – Visible InGaN Injection Lasers (VIGIL), SOL BAA 07-28, DUE DATE: 060407, POC HENRYK TEMKIN, DARPA/MTO, FAX (703) 696-2206

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
The objective of the VIGIL program is to develop visible InGaN/GaN lasers. Specific minimum program goals include:

•	Laser emission wavelength of 500 nm  
•	Room temperature CW output power of 1W 
•	Wallplug efficiency of 30% 
•	Demonstration of stable operation over a period of 1000 hr
•	Wafer yield on 2” diameter substrates of 20%

The main technology development part of the VIGIL program will be conducted in three Phases, each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics. The length of each of these Phases and specific measurable milestones for each Phase will be proposed by bidders and will be factors considered as part of the source selection process (see below).  In general, shorter Phases are preferable, but each Phase should clearly be adequate in duration to meet its objectives with reasonable risks and costs.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.  

DARPA may consider focused proposals addressing specific technical challenges in epitaxy, (e.g. development of non-polar substrates or templates with low defect density), device design, (e.g. demonstration of active layer structures with high internal efficiency), or characterization, (e.g. methods of measuring interfacial electric fields of radiative recombination lifetime of minority carriers), that may be necessary to meet the above program goals. Those offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data or simulations, leading to estimates of their importance in achieving operational targets of the envisioned VIGIL laser. Such proposals should also specify the period of performance for each of their Phase(s) and identify measurable milestones by which performance could be monitored (see above). 

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-28, entitled Visible InGaN Injection Lasers (VIGIL) is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; the submission process; abstract and proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.  The BAA may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/mto (go to “solicitation” area) or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format or following the submission instructions described in the BAA may not be reviewed. 

PROPOSER’S QUESTIONS

A Proposer’s Questions, website will be posted for BAA 07-28 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA07-28@darpa.mil.

<RESPDATE>050107
<ARCHDATE>05312007
<CONTACT>Heather Valiga 301-227-5822
<DESC>The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved. The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to MTS Systems Corporation.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This acquisition is for an MTS Axial/Torsional System which is a Load Test Frame, for axial and torsion fatigue testing, with a Hydraulic Power Unit. This machine is designed to place composite materials under various ranges of loading over different planes, allowing for the studying of the effects of different loads on different design materials which will lead to improved hull and other structural designs. The MTS Axial Torsional Testing System is the only machine compatible directly with Code 65’s already-established system of hydraulic grips.  Additionally, the compatibility and interconnectivity of the existing control electronics used by existing, similar MTS machines allow for efficient use and servicing across the entire Carderock facility and allows for quick troubleshooting and repair resulting in minimal down-time and notable cost savings.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16 as well as DCN 20070327. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334519 with an applicable size standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to acquire continued research and development efforts directed toward the fabrication of carbon-carbon composite reentry materials for shape stable nosetip (SSNT) and control surface applications; development and fabrication of other advanced reentry materials; and supporting engineering studies.  The proposed effort will support the Navy’s MK4 and MK5 SLBM Reentry Systems and will also encompasses research and development efforts for the fabrication of thermal protection system materials and components.  This effort will be fulfilled through other than full and open competition with Intermat, 389 Hill Street, Biddeford, Maine 04005-4335.  Intermat is uniquely qualified to conduct this effort as Intermat along with its parent company, Fiber Materials, Incorporated, are the sole suppliers of carbon-carbon composite SSNT for the Navy’s MK5 reentry body.  The unique SSNT technology has proven to be the most effec!  tive solution ever devised for ensuring reliable, repeatable, and accurate reentry body flight performance in SSNT extremely harsh reentry environment.  It is of the utmost importance to maintain consistency when fabricating these materials.  Since the billet weaving and densification procedures for these material have a profound effect on their thermal and mechanical properties and their ablative and aerodynamic flight performance, use of the identical SSNT weaving and processing cycles is absolutely necessary.  The company’s carbon-carbon weaving and processing cycles are proprietary and only available from Intermat.   A cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract is anticipated with a five-year performance period.  All deliveries will be to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division; Detachment Washington, DC; US Naval Observatory, Building 56; 3450 Massachusetts Avenue NW; Washington, DC.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Boston University for a seven-year continuation of Contract N01-HC-25195 for the Framingham Heart Study.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1.  The Framingham Heart Study began in 1948.  Since the late 1960s, this contractor has been involved in recruitment, examination, and follow-up of participants in an epidemiological study of 14,531 persons from three generations residing in Framingham, Massachusetts.  The purpose of this study is to identify new risk factors for cardiovascular and lung diseases, to describe the trends and progression of these diseases, and to identify the contribution of genetic and genetic-environmental factors in the development of these diseases.  The contract will require full comparability with the ongoing study, covering examination and follow- up of the original Framingham Cohort (aged 28-62 at study entry in 1948), the Offspring Cohort (aged 5-70 at study entry starting in 1971), and the Third Generation Cohort (aged 19-70 at study entry starting in 2002).  This will entail conduct of a 30th, 31st, and 32nd clinical examination of the surviving members of the original Framingham participants; a 9th examination of the Offspring participants; and a 2nd examination of the Third Generation participants; performance of follow-up for morbidity and mortality in all three generations; and performance of comprehensive genetic laboratory and statistical activities, data analysis, and scientific publications efforts utilizing the collected Framingham data.  We do anticipate several subcontracting opportunities during the course of this contract award.  As an example, the operation of a pulmonary function reading center could be subcontracted to another organization.  Any interested parties in this or other subcontracting opportunities should contact the Contracting Officer for further details.  The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for continuation of this study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study.  Interested respondents must submit, within 45 days of this announcement, written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a request for proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

The National Lakes Survey project assessment is being undertaken to generate statistically valid estimates of the biological health of lakes across the country. Tasks under this requirement will include: (1) Conducting laboratory analysis of phytoplankton populations including identification and enumeration using a specific methodology that was adapted from the ?Protocol for the Analysis of Algal Samples collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Water-Quality Assessment program? (Charles et al., 2003).  This methodology involves microscopic examination of preserved phytoplankton samples collected.  Laboratories must use the inverted microscope method as described in the ?Survey of the Nation?s Lakes Laboratory Methods Manual (LMM)?.  Sample preparation, necessary materials and equipment, and analytical procedures are described in the LMM.   (2) Adhering to the strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements of the EPA?s ?Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  (3) Providing logistical support by receiving, logging and storing field samples received.  (4) Adhering to sample tracking procedures and ensuring that the reporting of all required data, calculations, and results is accomplished within the designated times, on the designated forms, and is submitted via any designated data management system.   The successful small business laboratory will receive pre-labled samples on a regular basis during the project period.  Preserved samples are to be processed, enumerated, and identified (at the 300 organism level), with the exception of diatoms, to the lowest possible taxonomic level (generally genus) using agreed upon standard keys and references.  The contractor shall also maintain a reference library/voucher collection using digital imagery.  The EPA anticipates awarding a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under this solicitation.  The BPA will establish a fixed rate for each sample analysis.  The BPA will establish an ordering period of four (4) months.  Over this four month period, EPA estimates a total of between 1150 and 1300 analysis will be required.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after BPA award will also be a part of the solicitation.   THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million.  The projected start date is June 1, 2007.  The solicitation is expected to be posted to FedBizOpps on or about May 2, 2007 as Solicitation Number PR-CI-07-10632.  No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the FedBizOpps website for updates or changes.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note: 1.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Office of Engineering (E) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Avid Technology, Inc., 1101 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Suite 600, Washington, DC 20004.   Avid will be required to upgrade and expand their existing proprietary video editing system and service contract.   The contract with Avid will include design and testing efforts that must be completed within a tight schedule. Avid provides the government with an assured route to suitable technical performance, backward compatibility, and networked digital editing equipment to support increased programming.  The contract with Avid is needed because the rapid expansion of programming has outstripped the Voice of America?s (VOA) capacity and technical resources to provide critical video editing support.  A contract with Avid is required to avoid any compromise to the Agency?s mission in providing vital information to critical Muslim audiences in the target region in a timely manner. The Government?s determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested firms must submit documentation that is sufficient in detail to allow an evaluation without the need for requesting them to provide additional information of their capability and demonstrated experience in meeting this requirement.  BBG must receive all documentation by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), May  3, 2007.  Any questions regarding this Notice shall be submitted via email or facsimile to Mr. Berel Dorfman, Office of Contracts (M/CON/CR), bdorfman@ibb.gov or via fax to (202) 260-0855.  Telephone responses of a firm's statements of interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience will not be accepted by the BBG. This Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate a one-year base period contract with four (4) additional one-year option periods to acquire the services of a third-party contractor to provide technical oversight of laboratory services (provided under separate contract to FRA) for toxicological analysis of samples obtained from various railroad employees subject to FRA’s mandatory Post-Accident Toxicological Testing Program, as implemented pursuant to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 219 -- Control of Alcohol and Drug Use; and to provide specialized, expert advice and assistance to FRA in accomplishing its objectives and mandates under 49 CFR Part 219 and 49 CFR Part 40 --Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs. Since 1986, the FRA has required the special testing of rail crews to determine if drugs or alcohol were either a primary or contributing cause to a significant rail accident or incident. Following regulation-triggering events, samples are collected by carrier-selected medical facilities using FRA mandatory post-accident split-sample toxicology kits. Specimens include urine and whole blood for surviving crew members, and urine, whole blood, and tissue for deceased crew members. Samples are analyzed by utilizing FRA-established cutoffs in urine and whole blood, and results obtained must be scientifically sound and legally defensible. The third-party technical oversight contractor (contractor) must be capable of assessing and attesting to the reliability of the Department of Health and Human Services/Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS/SAMHSA) certified laboratory’s capabilities for (1) Receiving and preserving specimen sets. (2) Accessioning specimens and implementing strict chain-of-custody procedures. (3) Analyzing specimen sets based on FRA-approved screening and confirmatory protocols using approved immunoassays ranging from KIMS, EIA, RIA, or FPIA to GC/MS. Additionally, the contractor must provide FRA with ongoing assessments on the qualifications and expertise of the laboratory and assigned personnel relative to the interpretation of test findings and their capabilities to (a) provide expert testimony regarding the laboratory’s analysis of urine, whole blood, and tissue; (b) advise FRA regarding the significance of analytical data in the determination of accident/incident cause and the meaning of test findings with respect to human performance; (c) provide a statement of pharmacological significance related to positive determination, addressing drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, possible usage scenarios, and possible physiological effects; and (d) properly interpret post-mortem findings in light of possible microbial generation of alcohol. The contractor will be utilized by the FRA to help ensure, through scheduled quarterly inspections using DHHS certified/licensed inspectors and forensic toxicology experts, that the contracted laboratory’s procedures and analysis of FRA samples are scientifically sound and legally defensible, that the laboratory maintains high levels of quality and reliability in its product and service offerings to FRA, and that the laboratory’s operations otherwise fully satisfy FRA’s Post-Accident Toxicological Testing Program scientific, technical, and administrative goals. The contractor subjects the laboratory to both open and blind proficiency testing in whole blood and urine. Samples are constructed by the contractor to challenge the laboratory’s ability to analyze specimens in accordance with approved FRA protocols at established cutoffs. Following inspections, the contractor drafts (for FRA-approval) reports of findings, recommendations, and/or required changes to operating procedures for implementation by the contracted laboratory. The contractor is responsible for providing expert advice on Department of Transportation (DOT), Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance guidance documents, and developing or assisting in the preparation of materials and conducting technical training for FRA, Office of Safety, Operating Practices (OP) inspectors (Federal and state). The contractor must be prepared to individually instruct or co-instruct classes in urine specimen collection, laboratory analysis, MRO functions, Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) functions, breath specimen collection, mandatory post-accident specimen collection for both surviving and deceased crew members, and other topics as assigned. The contractor is responsible for providing FRA with one or more technical experts for Part 219 compliance audits of both rail carriers and their service providers at various designated locations throughout the country. Contractor technical experts must be prepared to act as senior adjunct members of a team of FRA inspectors auditing all drug and alcohol requirements of the applicable federal rules (both Part 219 and Part 40). Special expertise is required in urine, blood, and breath specimen collection; collection chain-of-custody and documentation; laboratory procedures, analysis, and test result documentation; MRO procedures and documentation; SAP procedures and documentation; and other elements and requirements of said rules. The contractor is responsible for development or updating of the Part 219 Compliance Manual for FRA OP Inspectors and the railroad industry, which provides detailed protocol on how to properly evaluate all Part 219 and Part 40 elements, and how to comply with all Part 219 requirements, including service provider and carrier responsibilities and record keeping. The contractor is also responsible for developing and presenting seminars specifically designed to show regulated carriers how to properly comply with Part 219 drug and alcohol regulations, and seminars/training modules for OP inspectors to certify them as Part 219 compliance field experts. Additionally, the scope of the Post-Accident laboratory contract is subject to change due to scientific and technical innovations; consequently, this scope requirement may be subject to change.  As of the release/posting of this notice, it is anticipated that on or about March 30, 2007, the subject solicitation will be issued (i.e., made available) in electronic media and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (formerly known as the Electronic Posting System (EPS)). Once posted, the solicitation may be downloaded or printed from the following Internet address: http://www.fedbizopps gov/. The FRA does not intend to make the solicitation available in hard copy. (Note: The anticipated solicitation release date cited above is a target date and is provided for information purposes only. The actual date of posting of the solicitation at FedBizOpps may be before, on, or after that date.) As of the release/posting of this notice, it is anticipated that the closing date for receipt of offers for the subject solicitation will be on or about April 30, 2007. (Note: The anticipated solicitation closing date cited above is a target date and is provided for information purposes only. The solicitation, and the solicitation alone, shall establish and specify the closing or due date for receipt of offers.) Materials or other submission that will be due on the closing date established in the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be specified, in full, in the RFP.  The FRA intends to state in the solicitation that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions. At the conclusion of the FRA’s evaluations of offers (and any negotiations or discussions if such are conducted with offerors in the competitive range), as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority (SSA), and the submission and evaluation of any final proposal revisions, if such are requested by the Contracting Officer/SSA, the SSA will make a determination as to which offer is of the best value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors and subfactors set forth in the solicitation, and make contract award to that single, responsible source/offeror. This is an unrestricted, competitive procurement. All eligible, responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Corporation, of Piscataway, New Jersey, for the acquisition of an Akta Purifier.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the purifier to incorporate the following features:  automatic programmable threshold-triggered control incorporating multiple (at least 6) system-integrated input signals; and controller flexibility allowing for simultaneous projects and switching between program and manual control.  NIST Biochemical Science Division requires the means to purify proteins from complex starting materials.  This process is known as chromatography; it has been developed for nonprotein materials over several decades, but only recently has protein chromatography become efficiently automated.  Because the proteins are often fragile, the purification process must occur gently, quickly and efficiently, and the apparatus must be reliable.  The apparatus must incorporate a subsystem for fractionating the output, and this subsystem must be fully integrated with the analysis, flow control, and data recording features of the entire apparatus.  GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required purifier.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>C--THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLANSHOLDER.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with HDR Engineering, Inc., for a new Architect- Engineer contract.  The contract will be an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contract for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for two additional years; not to exceed a total of three years. While the estimated dollar amo unt per year is $650,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than $650,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $1,950,000.00 for the life of the contract, including options.  This contract is in support of the Lake Okeechobee Watershed project.  It is being developed through a Project Implementation Report (PIR) as a modification to the Central and South Florida (C&SF) Project as a part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restorati on Program (CERP).  The Lake Okeechobee Watershed study area is comprised of five watershed basins north of Lake Okeechobee:  Lake Istokpoga, Fisheating Creek, Istokpoga/Indian Prairie, Kissimmee River and the Taylor Creek/Nubbin Slough planning areas.  Th e project objectives are to improve the ecological health of Lake Okeechobee and Lake Istokpoga, increase the spatial extent of the habitat by rehydrating wetlands, and provide water storage and water quality treatment throughout the basins north of Lake O keechobee.  In addition to determining a regulation schedule for Lake Istokpoga, the project goal is to develop prospective management measures to maximize the water storage, water treatment and creation of wetland areas as identified in the Restudy Report  (or Yellow Book) that developed the CERP.   Currently, there is a task order in place with HDR Engineering that is almost complete.  This contract has provided services to formulate the Tentatively Selected Plan (TSP) from the many watershed alternatives, optimizing storage and reducing phosphorus l oading, to prepare the Alternative Formulation Briefing (AFB) package and presentation, to provide responses to the External Independent Technical Review (ITR) and Value Engineering study comments, revise and consolidate the AFB package, assist in the AFB Briefing, prepare responses to the AFB comments, and provide initial document research to prepare the biological assessment.   The proposed new task order contract would consist of providing services to model the Tentative Selective Plan utilizing the project-specific OASIS-Simulation of the Lake Okeechobee Watershed (O-SLOW) model developed under the current task order, continue efforts in preparing the biological assessment, consolidate the extensive geotechnical and survey investigation data and historical knowledge to prepare feasibility designs for the six constructible TSP components, and begin efforts in preparing a clear, c oncise and defendable draft PIR, following all current regulations, policy and guidance, and to accomplish these tasks within an expedited schedule.  The contract would also include efforts to complete the draft PIR, assist and prepare responses to various  reviews, model the TSP, refining designs and modeling the revised designs, assisting in consolidating the final PIR, preparation and assistance in presentations, conducting meetings, and some travel, also under expedited schedule deadlines.  It would be v ery costly to the Government, both financially and technically, to develop a new consultant's knowledge base of the Lake Okeechobee Watershed Project.  Interested concerns should contact Kathie Duke at 904-232-3713 (or email at kathleen.b.duke@usace.army.m il) for information on submitting documentation demonstrating their qualifications to accomplish this project.  Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Kathie Duke at 904-232-3713.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLANSHOLDER.

<DESC>Joint Contracting Command Iraq/Afghanistan on behalf of the Gulf Regional Division (GRD) Reconstruction Logistics intends to solicit for continued operations of two strategically located Wholesale Distribution Center Warehousing and Staging Area facilities; one located within the vicinity of Baghdad North/Abu Guraib and one located within the vicinity of the Port of Umm Qasr, both having satellite locations; for the receipt, accounting, cross-docking, re-packaging, re-shipping, and re-distribution of material with minimal warehousing operations within reasonable cost.  Secondarily, this proposed contract shall provide the capability to facilitate the management and physical responsibility to maintain site operations, security, management, facilities/equipment maintenance, life support, and secure transportation requirements for the movement of materiel from the Wholesale Distribution Center Warehouse and Staging Area to receiving retails distribution centers or end users.  Additionally, subject services may be used to move materiel for projects supporting U.S. military forces, coalition and/or multinational forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies.  Each of the two warehouse facilities will require the necessary maintenance to ensure the facilities are operated in an efficient and effective manner that is conducive to perform tactical, operational, and strategic level logistics.  Site management and operations will require the need to facilitate interior security, which will be performed by an independent contractor, of associated facilities, any auxiliary sites, and all materiel under control of the contractor in order to ensure that equipment, supplies, and materiel can be held in a fully accountable, short-term, transient status pending redistribution to its final destination.  As part of the overall concept of operations, the Contractor will be responsible for providing or coordinating secure transportation services which include but will not be limited to moving equipment, supplies, and materiel using all types of consignments ranging from local less-than-truck-load moves to long hauls involving multiple truck loads.

<DESC>Project Objectives

The procedures of the study, including the intervention, will be designed by CDC and HRSA with collaborative input from the contractors.  The objective of this contract is for contractors to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine an intervention to increase retention of HIV+ patients in primary medical care.  Contractors will implement and oversee the trial, assure its quality, and supply CDC and HRSA with relevant outcome data described below. We anticipate that the intervention will increase HIV patient retention at least 30% relative to the rates before the intervention.  If found to be efficacious, the government will be able to disseminate this intervention to HIV primary care clinics throughout the United States.   


Scope of Work

The intervention will be implemented and tested for efficacy at six HIV primary care clinics.  Clinic attendance (from clinic records) is the primary outcome variable.  Three clinics (Panel A clinics) will be randomly selected to implement the intervention immediately after baseline clinic data are tabulated and a cohort of patients enrolled and surveyed at each of the six sites; the other three clinics (Panel B clinics) will delay implementation of the intervention for approximately 12 months and will serve as a control group for evaluating the efficacy of the intervention as delivered by Panel A clinics during the prior year.  The first follow-up tabulation of attendance will occur at each clinic after this 12-month intervention period.  Panel B clinics will then implement the intervention for 12 months (and Panel A clinics will continue implementing the intervention). Follow-up tabulation of attendance will be made at each of the six clinics.

The period of performance for this contract shall be “Date of Award” through five years thereafter.  The work shall be complete in five phases as follows:

Phase 1.   Protocol Development (Date of award through 12 months thereafter)
Phase 2.   Pre-OMB Approval:   (12 months from date of award through 24 months from date of award)
Phase 3.    Intervention Implementation Panel A  (24 months from date of award through 36 months from date of award)
Phase 4.    Intervention Implementation Panel B & Continue Panel A  (36 months from date of award through 48 months from date of award)
Phase 5.     Intervention Continues and Final Follow-up Survey  (48 months from the date of the award through 60 months from date of the award).

The place of performance shall be the contractor’s facility.

After contract award, CDC will determine which clinics will be randomly assigned to implement the intervention immediately (Panel A clinics) and which will delay implementation for approximately one year (Panel B clinics).  Phase 3 therefore is presented in 2 options, and the offerors’ proposal must include both options.  

Option 3A.    Panel A clinics will implement the intervention during Phase 3,and should therefore include appropriate staffing.
 Option 3B.   Panel B clinics, the control group clinics, will enroll their cohort during phase 3  but will not implement the intervention during phase 3.  Requirements for study-specific case management and peer outreach should not be included. Appropriate staffing is to be included by Panel B clinics.

Task 3.1  Investigators Meeting:  The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to finalize intervention procedures, and revise timelines.   The contractor shall continue to participate in bi-weekly conference calls.
Task 3.2  Cohort Enrollment:  Identify and enroll a cohort of at least 250 patients during a 4 to 6-month period from the clinic-wide data base.  This cohort should include sufficient numbers of patients who have attended clinic inconsistently.  Attempts should be made to enroll all new patients during the patient enrollment period. 
Task 3.3   Administer Questionnaires.  These are to be administered  to the minimum of 250 cohort members.
Task 3.4   Medical chart Abstraction .  Contractor shall perform medical chart abstractions of each cohort member, using the methodology given at the Data Manager Training at CDC (Phase 1).

This shall include attendance data for the clinic-wide population as well as the cohort.  The format for that part of the attendance data to be transmitted to CDC will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.7   Transmitting Data.   Transmit attendance, medical chart data, survey (questionnaire) and patient contact data to the CDC over the secure data network.
Task 3.8  Intervention Training-Panel A.  The contractor’s clinic staff shall participate in a four-hour intervention training at the clinic site (Panel A clinics).  The intervention training is to be conducted by a separately funded training contractor, and will require clinic staff to participate in a series of adult learning activities (e.g., written exercises, role playing). 
Task 3.9  Identify Patients at Risk-Panel A.  Implement a method to identify patients at risk of falling out of medical care (Panel A clinics), using the methods in the finalized study protocol from Phase 1. 
Task 3.10  Begin Referrals-Panel A.  Refer patients at risk of falling out of care to a case manager and peer outreach worker as appropriate (Panel A clinics) within one week of screening for this risk.
Task 3.11   Begin Intervention delivery-Panel A.  Contractors shall begin delivering the intervention (Panel A clinics) according to the intervention content determined at the time the study protocol is finalized in Phase 1.

The intervention will target those at risk of missing scheduled clinic appointments as determined by past clinic attendance records and other information.  The intervention will be given to those enrolled in the cohort as well as to other clinic patients deemed at risk of missing appointments.  The intervention will have multiple components including individual- and systems-level components such as:
messages given to patients by providers about the importance of staying in care.
brochures and posters (developed under a separate Intervention Trainer contract ).
case managers to work with patients in a client-centered manner and conduct outreach to patients who have not been seen at clinic during a specific time period.
peers who will help teach and advise patients how to successfully navigate within a complex medical setting and perform outreach to patients who have missed clinic appointments.
structural changes in the clinic to make it easier for patients to attend clinic and stay in care.

<SUBJECT>99--Tower Simulation System - Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>5581
<RESPDATE>050207
<CONTACT>Ryan King, 202-267-7851
<DESC>*** REVISION II (04/18/2007): This announcement is revised as follows: 1) Due to security and planning requirements, it is now required that vendors provide a response in accordance with the "Vendor Response" section of the original announcement.  Responses must be provided by 12:00 noon Eastern Time on April 25, 2007.  As mentioned, this is necessary for both security and space planning purposes.  Vendors that do not respond may not be permitted entry into Industry Day 1.  2) A revised Draft Statement of Work and revised Draft System Operational Program Requirements document are attached.  *** REVISION (04/12/2007): This announcement is revised to include Notice #4 under the "Notices to Vendors" section of the announcement below.  The attached Sources Sought Announcement is also revised. *** ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT: GENERAL DESCRIPTION:   FAA has a requirement for the design, engineering development, documentation, production, assembly, installation, checkout and facility interface at the delivery site of Tower Simulation Systems (TSS) for the TSS Program. This includes the associated program management, training, Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) including the setup and management of a Training System Support Center (TSSC), as well as the requirement to conduct a Technical Refurbishment Study.  FAA anticipates that the Tower Simulation Systems will be available as Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) items.   The attached Draft Statement of Work and Draft System Operational Program Requirements document describe the needs and requirements of FAA with regard to this effort.  Also attached is a Draft Demonstration Scenario script provided as an example and discussed further below.   This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open competitive basis in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  SOURCES SOUGHT / INDUSTRY DAYS:   In an effort to provide interested vendors (herein after referred to as vendors) the opportunity to learn more about the TSS program, its requirements and the anticipated acquisition strategy for the effort, FAA intends to hold an industry day at or near FAA Headquarters in Washington D.C. on May 1, 2007.  This will be known as Industry Day 1.  Industry Day 1 will provide a forum for open discussion on the TSS program and give vendors the opportunity to ask questions and provide comments on the Draft Statement of Work and Draft System Operational Program Requirements document provided with this announcement.  Additionally, during Industry Day 1 FAA will discuss the simulator demonstration which will be required as part of the evaluation for the TSS requirement.  So that FAA may plan appropriately for Industry Day 1 vendors should respond to this Sources Sought announcement in accordance with the "Vendor Response" section below.   After Industry Day 1 but prior to Industry Day 2, FAA plans to release the solicitation for this TSS requirement.  FAA anticipates holding Industry Day 2 at San Antonio International Airport (SAT - San Antonio, Texas) on May 16, 2007, however this date is subject to change.  It is thought that the information provided both in this sources sought announcement and at Industry Day 1 will be sufficient for a vendor to determine its ability to compete for this requirement and whether or not to attend Industry Day 2.  FAA intends to provide in the solicitation a Demonstration Scenario script vendors will use to develop a scenario for use in the simulator demonstration to FAA.  The attached Draft Demonstration Scenario script is provided to give vendors an idea of what the final script may look like.  The purpose of Industry Day 2 will be for vendors to receive and collect information necessary to prepare for and perform the simulator demonstration.  At Industry Day 2 FAA will provide to vendors access to San Antonio International Airport which will enable vendors to gather sufficient information to develop a visual database for that airport which will be used to run the scenario for the simulator demonstration.  Vendors are cautioned that the investment of time, money and resources necessary to develop this database and later perform a demonstration of the scenario using their own simulator equipment is solely at the vendor's risk.  FAA will not reimburse vendors for any costs associated with the demonstration.   It is anticipated that all demonstrations will take place at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ; however this location is not yet firm and is subject to change.  FAA anticipates that roughly six to eight weeks will be given from Industry Day 2 until the simulator demonstrations are to take place.   VENDOR RESPONSE: Interested Vendors should respond to this sources sought announcement by providing the items listed below.  Responses should be provided by 12:00 noon Eastern Time on April 25, 2007.   1.	Notice of Intent - Each vendor shall provide an email to Ryan King at ryan.m.king@faa.gov indicating its intent to attend Industry Day 1.   2.	List of Attendees - Included in or attached to the email, vendors shall provide a list of the representatives to attend Industry Day 1.  The names and titles of the representatives shall be provided.   3.	Questions/Comments - As a separate attachment to the email, vendors may provide questions and comments regarding the draft documents provided with this announcement.  Questions and comments from vendors are not required.  It is preferred that questions and comments be provided in Word format.  4.	Point of Contact - Included in the email, vendors shall provide the name and contact information of an individual FAA may contact if necessary regarding this procurement.  NOTICES TO VENDORS: NOTICE #1: Industry Day 1 will be held at or near FAA HQ in Washington, DC.  The specific location and time will be provided at a later date on the FAA Contract Opportunities website.   NOTICE #2: To be eligible to attend Industry Day 2 vendors must provide the names and titles of the representatives to attend Industry Day 2 not later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time on May 7, 2007.  This shall be done via email to Ryan King at ryan.m.king@faa.gov. NOTICE #3: FAA prefers that not more than six representatives from each vendor attend Industry Day 1.  FAA requires that not more than three representatives from each vendor attend Industry Day 2.   NOTICE #4: In order to participate in this acquisition and to be considered eligible for award vendors must attend Industry Day 2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The TSS program is separate from the Air Traffic Controller Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS) program.  The ATCOTS program is anticipated to move forward regardless of the activities of the TSS program.   This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of these services, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a request for proposal.  The Government is not liable for any costs incurred for the simulator demonstration or the development of a written proposal. Additionally, the Government is not liable for any costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries or responses to this announcement and will not reimburse any firm for costs incurred responding to this public announcement or as a result of the Industry Days. Until further notice all updates and announcements related to this procurement will be communicated via the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm) which was used to post this announcement.  Vendors are responsible for monitoring this website for updates to this procurement.

TITLE:  Network Attack Traceback

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-04-IFKA

CFDA Number:  12.800 

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 5 Apr 05; FY 06 by 1 Mar 06;  FY 07 by 1 Mar 07; and FY08 by 15 Oct 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2 p.m. Eastern time on 1 Mar 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.         

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

DESCRIPTION:  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/IF, in conjunction with the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase our knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Network Attack Traceback, to include beta testing of prototype capabilities.  Solutions to basic and applied  research and engineering traceback problems using innovative approaches are sought.  This includes high-risk, high-payoff capabilities for non-cooperative and/or hostile network environments. The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques that provide capabilities which will increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack, ideally to the originating host, using solely technical means.  We are particularly interested in tracing attacks that would compromise the confidentiality and integrity of information on Intelligence Community (IC) networks.  These IC networks include the NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS, and IC enclaves.  Techniques designed for tracing Denial-of-Service attacks in IC networks are NOT the focus of this BAA, nor are techniques that involve probabalistic packet marking. ARDA is especially interested in traceback techniques for attacks launched with single packets involving encrypted payloads, chaff and other obfuscation techniques. 
Research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities ideally addressing both the collection and analysis aspects of the traceback problem.  However, projects specializing in highly novel and interesting techniques for just collection or just analysis will also be considered, if deemed to be of "breakthrough" quality and importance.  The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities.  Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use, particularly within the IC, are of high interest. 
Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work efficiently. 
Offerors are encouraged to submit classified white papers via the appropriate channels.  Contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII.  
SCOPE:  The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques to increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack.  The areas of interest include the broad range of tools and techniques to traceback the network attack to the originating Local Area Network, the attacker's Internet Service Provider, or an originating Autonomous System with the goal of identifying the specific host which launched the attack. Deliverables will be technical reports, software, demonstrations, and  results of experiments which provide evidence and metrics concerning the assertions/claims about the research. Demonstrations may involve exploratory development models (ie brassboards) if appropriate.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT
(Revised and Superseded)

(1)  GENERAL:  The Department of Commerce is conducting market research in order to determine the capabilities of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone small businesses, HUBZone 8(a), and 8(a). The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 541511 and the size standard is $23 million. 


(2)  STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS:  The Department of Commerce is embarking on the next stage of its Financial Management evolution.  The Department’s strategic vision is aligned with the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) goals of standardization, consolidation and optimization in achieving and sustaining financial management excellence.  Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive financial management modernization initiative focused on deploying the next generation of strategic, process, technology, change management and human performance components.

(2a)  Background
The Commerce Business Systems (CBS) Solutions Center (CSC), located in Gaithersburg, Maryland is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the CBS suite of software. At this time, CBS consists of the Core Financial System (CFS) including the Commerce Purchase Card System (CPCS), and the Budget and Execution Data Warehouse.  The CBS is integrated with the Commerce Standard Acquisition and Reporting System (CSTARS) (information pertinent to CSTARS is available at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CASD_automatedProcSystem.html), the National Finance Center (NFC) Payroll System and the Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP). The CFS is a customized Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) application, providing financial management and accounting capabilities which support 12 of the 15 Commerce bureaus.

The original business model was to allow each bureau to establish unique business rules, implement an instance of the system based on these rules, and run the system on the bureau's server.  Over time, this model has proven inefficient, ineffective, costly, and time-consuming.  The new business model of standardization, consolidation and optimization is intended to address these deficiencies, and allow the Department to achieve the goals of the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB).

(2b)  Commerce Financial Management Modernization Initiative
To achieve the Departmental goals, the key initiatives identified are: 1) Financial Management Line of Business & other Lines of Businesses; and 2) Standardization, Consolidation and Optimization.  The Department will also require a continuation of current system requirements for maintenance support, database administration and testing.

Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) & other Lines of Businesses
In March 2004, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiated a government-wide analysis of five lines of business (LoBs) supporting the President's Management Agenda goal to expand Electronic Government.

The FMLoB goals include facilitating strong internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting and other stewardship activities; reducing cost associated with implementing and operating financial management systems; standardizing systems, business processes and data elements and providing seamless data exchange between the Department and other federal agencies.  

This initiative will include a business case assessing Shared Service Providers’ capabilities in providing all four categories of service: technology hosting and administration, application management, business process services and system implementation services as outlined in FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance.  We anticipate the Contractor may assist DOC with the selection process.  The Department will undertake the broad scope of process re-engineering, systems implementation and deployment, change management, security management and integration activities necessary to achieve its vision.  We envision the Contractor leading many efforts including, but not limited to, Business Process Reengineering efforts.

Additionally, due to their interrelationship to FMLoB, this initiative must also include the following OMB defined lines of business and eGov initiatives:  1) Budget Formulation and Execution Line of Business (BFELoB); 2) Infrastructure Optimization Initiative Line of Business (IOILoB); 3) Human Resource Management Line of Business (HRMLoB); 4) Grants Management Line of Business (GMLoB); 5) Information Security System Line of Business (ISSLoB); 6) e-Loans; 7) e-Travel; 8) e-Payroll; 9) e-Training; and 10) e-Authentication.  The Contractor will be responsible for analyzing and integrating all these lines of businesses into any cost benefit analysis.

Standardization, Consolidation and Optimization

This initiative serves to standardize, consolidate and optimize strategic, process, technology, change management and human performance components across the Department, in coordination with the FMLoB initiative, as well as, the BFELoB, IOILoB, HRMLoB, GMLoB, ISSLoB and the e-Gov initiatives for Loans, Travel, Payroll and Training.  Some of the goals and outputs identified to-date for this initiative are: 1) Standardizing business processes: a) Standardizing use of data elements; b) establishing performance measures to assess implementation and execution of standard business processes; 2) Consolidation of services and/or processing; a) Auditing; b) Account Administration; c) Database Administration; d) Testing; e) Training; f) Helpdesk (both functional and technical); g) Portal and single sign-on (SSO); h) Data warehouses and data dissemination; and 3) Optimization of systems: a) Capability Maturity Model – Integrated (CMMI) certification; b) Implementation of a Departmental Change Control Board (CCB); c) Definition and implementation of software configuration management (SCM); and d) Addressing system performance tuning.


In furtherance of this new direction, the Department will be seeking contractor support to develop a Departmental Concept of Operations. This concept of operations includes high-level descriptions of information systems, their inter-relationships, and information flows. It also describes the operations that must be performed, who must perform them, and where and how the operations will be carried out. Further, it provides the foundation on which requirements definitions and the rest of the systems planning process are built. The Concept of Operations will also include a comprehensive strategy and detailed roadmap. The roadmap or plan will provide the overarching architecture around standardizing, consolidating and optimizing the Department’s business processes, administrative systems and technologies, user interaction and usability, data centers, security and integration components. The comprehensive strategy will also assess the feasibility of analyzing alternative options for consolidating financial management support to an application service provider to achieve financial management excellence.  We anticipate a contractor “assessing the feasibility of analyzing alternative options” or actually conducting an analysis for either maintaining the CBS and feeder systems or transitioning to a shared service provider.  

As a part of the comprehensive strategy, the Department also requires a continuation of current requirements such as both current system maintenance support and overarching support during transition/migration from its current financial management state to its optimal future state, including all design, architecture, integration, and deployment activities as well as sustaining this future state, including continual business improvements to achieve both high efficiency and optimization.  It is essential the contractor develop, manage, and execute an all-encompassing solution that includes maintaining current applications in parallel while performing transition/migration.

In addition, the CSC is responsible for maintaining the CBS/CFS application software and applicable interfaces. Each of the primary CBS bureaus; Census, NIST, and NOAA, are responsible for operating standard financial management software (e.g., CFS) on their own hardware platforms.  Each of the separate bureaus has its own test and production environments within their respective data centers. The Department is currently in the process of a multi-year CBS/CFS server consolidation project. Its primary goal is to consolidate the three current Bureau production environments including the CSC environment, as well as other business system applications, to a single platform located at a single data center. As a part of this transition, current system requirements for maintenance support, database administration and testing must be preserved and managed while also establishing new requirements for maintenance support, database administration and testing in the consolidated environment.

(3)  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  FAR Subpart 9.5 prohibits a Contractor from engaging in any actions that present an actual or apparent conflict of interest in the performance of a federal contract. 
 

OMB’s policy regarding the modernization of federal financial management systems such as DOC’s Core Financial System, is that, with limited exception, an agency seeking to upgrade to the next major release of its current core financial management system or modernize to a different core financial management system must either migrate to a Shared Services Center (SSC) or qualified private sector provider, or be designated as an SSC.  It appears that OMB’s current directions may give rise to apparent or actual Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) under FAR Subpart 9.5.  For the performance of DOC's requirements, DOC is striving to obtain a robust competition.  A current Shared Service Provider (SSP) may be precluded from performing both DOC’s prospective requirements and performing its function as a SSP, without engaging in an actual or apparent OCI under FAR Subpart 9.5 and relevant GAO decisions.  Therefore, submissions from a SSP or a current subcontractor to a SSP shall explain how the two roles do not involve actual or apparent OCI, as prohibited under FAR Subpart 9.5.  Further, such SSP or current subcontractor to a SSP must also describe how they would avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any actual or apparent OCI that are perceived to exist.


(4) SOURCE OF INFORMATION:  Interested firms are encouraged to become familiar with the FSIO website at http://www.fsio.gov/fsio/fsiodata/ in order to understand the requirements of Federal agencies to meet the standards, performance measures, and compliance requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget task force. Many of these requirements most likely will be incorporated into a prospective contract as well as the performance measures regarding timeliness and quality standards.


(5)  INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PREPARATION OF A RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET RESEARCH.  Interested parties shall provide a response in accordance with Attachment 1(Revised and Superseded) – Instruction on the Preparation of a Response to the Market Research.  Interested small businesses shall complete the template so that the information reflects the experience and capabilities of the small business as a prime.  If the small business would like to identify a potential subcontractor, the information shall be provided in response to block 11 of the template and a separate form may be completed that represents the experience and capabilities of the prospective subcontractor.  If the subcontractor is also a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUBZone, HUBZone 8(a) or 8(a), the Government may consider the information as an individual and separate submission.  If the subcontractor is a large business or small business, the information will not be utilized to make a set aside determination at this time.  The intent here is to review the information of the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUBZone, HUBZone 8(a) or 8(a) in order to determine its capability to prime the work based on its experience and capabilities in meeting the various requirements specified in the template in Attachment 1(Revised and Superseded).  If the small business does not have experience or techniques to address a specific area, it shall be clearly stated in the response to the template.  In addition, the small business would need to address the obvious weakness in managing, as a prime, an area of the requirement in which it lacks direct experience.  Block 11 should also be used to make recommendations to the Government, such as, the type of information regarding the system that would assist in the preparation of a proposal, contract type, and performance measures identifying the standards and application.  


(6)  PROPOSED STRATEGY:  The Government intends on reviewing all submissions received in response to this market research announcement.  Firms may be requested to submit additional information in the form of a face-to-face meeting with a panel of Government representatives.    Upon completion of the market research, the Government will develop requirements, performance measures, inspection and acceptance procedures, as well as other areas of a Request for Proposal (RFP) taking into consideration the information provided in response to this announcement.  The Government anticipates conducting a presolicitation conference.  Information about the presolicitation conference will be provided in the future. If an RFP is issued, it will be performance based and include performance measures.  The submissions in response to this announcement are your opportunity to provide input to performance measures and standards, requirements, and other elements of the solicitation.

<DESC>Joint Contracting Command Iraq/Afghanistan on behalf of the Gulf Regional Division (GRD) Reconstruction Logistics intends to solicit for continued operations of two strategically located Wholesale Distribution Center Warehousing and Staging Area facilities; one located within the vicinity of Baghdad North/Abu Guraib and one located within the vicinity of the Port of Umm Qasr, both having satellite locations; for the receipt, accounting, cross-docking, re-packaging, re-shipping, and re-distribution of material with minimal warehousing operations within reasonable cost.  Secondarily, this proposed contract shall provide the capability to facilitate the management and physical responsibility to maintain site operations, security, management, facilities/equipment maintenance, life support, and secure transportation requirements for the movement of materiel from the Wholesale Distribution Center Warehouse and Staging Area to receiving retails distribution centers or end users.  Additionally, subject services may be used to move materiel for projects supporting U.S. military forces, coalition and/or multinational forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies.  Each of the two warehouse facilities will require the necessary maintenance to ensure the facilities are operated in an efficient and effective manner that is conducive to perform tactical, operational, and strategic level logistics.  Site management and operations will require the need to facilitate interior security, which will be performed by an independent contractor, of associated facilities, any auxiliary sites, and all materiel under control of the contractor in order to ensure that equipment, supplies, and materiel can be held in a fully accountable, short-term, transient status pending redistribution to its final destination.  As part of the overall concept of operations, the Contractor will be responsible for providing or coordinating secure transportation services which include but will not be limited to moving equipment, supplies, and materiel using all types of consignments ranging from local less-than-truck-load moves to long hauls involving multiple truck loads.  A draft PWS is attached.  Offerors may provide comments on the draft Performance Work Statement and a capability statement to the JCCI/A no later than 31 December 2006. Questions and comments will be answered after the due date via this notice.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of NetApp Storage Solutions (Immix Technology).  The use of a brand name description is essential to the IRM/EOC’s operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the services of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has already implemented the NetApp Enterprise Storage hardware and software, provided by NetApp, which is essential for the ESOC to be able to store large amounts of data to satisfy the customer’s storage solutions.  NetApp FAS systems are the industry’s broadest family of compatible storage systems, offering unmatched business agility, superior application uptime, simplicity of management, and low TCO.41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; or 41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s and EOC’s defined requirements as a key component of IRM/OPS/SIO/EOC’s Operational and Security Infrastructure.  This request is to renew support services which were provided to our organization in the past.    As this is a brand name request, the items requested are required to continue with the existing infrastructure environment and will not function in the manner which we require if it is crossed match with other appliances.<BR><BR>

Dorian's Event Log Management Suite is designed to save on resources with automated approaches to our mandated auditing requirements.  The Dorian Event Management suite allows for automated event log collection, instant alarms activated and storage.  This is critical to ensure network integrity, over the last couple of years GFS-Charleston's network infrastructure has grown from approx... 200+ to over 900 workstations just in the Openet environment.  Each workstation is configured with the DS security template that requires the workstation to crash if the audit logs become full.  Event Archiver will ensure that workstations remain operational 24x7 by automatically archiving the logs and clearing the logs from the workstation before it reaches capacity.   It also will alert the system manager if any suspicious or malicious activity has penetrated any of the systems within the network.   Failure to maintain service would likely lead to an interruption in daily operations, resulting to harm to the Government. To meet the above requirements, RM/GFS requires the purchase of the items listed below manufactured by Dorian Software: •	(1) Event Log Management Suite (1000 Workstation Licenses) with Event Rover, Event Alarm, Event Archiver & Event Analyst •	(1 Year) Dorian Platinum Support Service Purchase of these workstation licenses and support will allow RM/GFS, Charleston, SC to maintain its mission critical service which is vital for the proper execution of RM/GFS’s responsibility to the financial community.  It is essential that this mission critical software maintenance remain uninterrupted in order to maintain the operational effectiveness of RM/GFS employees and contractors.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1), as set forth by FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source”.  There are no actions that the Department may take to overcome future barriers to competition for this requirement.  This is due to the stringent requirements that are placed to ensure the security and integrity of the Department of State Networks as well as the server and workstation infrastructure.<BR><BR>

By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS Desktop support.  Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible  hardware configuration with existing DOS enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configuration that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components.

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

NASA invites you to submit a response to this RFI to assist in NASA’s efforts to mature preliminary documents related to the communications, command, control, and information requirements to be levied on NASA’s Constellation missions.  The consistent application of existing industry standards and the judicious development of common approaches to meet Constellation requirements are intended to reduce schedule and cost risk to the program, enable interoperability between space, ground and surface assets, and allow for the deployment of common hardware and software solutions across multiple assets. NASA has posted multiple Volumes of the Constellation Program’s Communications, Command, Control and Information (C3I) Interoperability Specification (in a variety of states of maturity, ranging from draft to baseline) at the following website associated with this RFI:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/c3i/default.asp    Additional presentation materials or documents may be made available at this site for background information only.  A “README.DOC” file has also been included on the site that provides additional information for the reviewer, including the current maturity levels of the documents and indications of their status.  NASA recognizes the importance of industry involvement in the validation of the key interface requirements to be placed on future NASA programs.  Through this RFI, NASA seeks validation of its latest space communications and data system requirements for the Crew Exploration Vehicle and supply vehicles; launch vehicles including the Crew Launch Vehicle; ground-based mission control centers for launch and long-term operations; and lunar surface systems.	In addition to validation of existing space system requirements, NASA also seeks new and innovative approaches to the development and operations of its ground and space data systems.	It is imperative that the proposed approaches meet NASA’s cost and schedule constraints, while also meeting the long-term objectives of interoperability, flexibility and evolvability.  In addition, it is NASA’s goal to make prudent use of existing technologies, standards, and commercial products to the maximum extent, while meeting the ambitious goals of the next several decades. The objective of this RFI is to request specific comments and suggestions pertaining to the information provided in the C3I Interoperability Specification and to request general information on existing commercial products which support common command and control functionality for space missions (often referred to as “mission control software” or “telemetry and command systems”).  Responses are requested to any or all of the following topics: 1.  Specific Volume Critique.  General and specific comments and recommendations against sections or specific requirements or other contents of the Volumes of the C3I Interoperability Specification. 2.  Suggestions and rationale regarding the extent of commonality across missions within the area of command and control.  For example, the possible advantages to common command buffer formats and dump capabilities. 3.  Novel architectural constructs for a mix of NASA, military, and commercial communications assets (both ground and space based) for command and data distribution from launch through lunar surface operations 4.  Novel methods for the long term (20+ year) management, storage, and retrieval of system data and products. 5.  Suggestions and rationale for the application of additional industry standards across a wide range of applications. 6.  Available commercial products available for integration by the vendor or others to provide command and control capabilities within major mission control center data systems.  Scope may include both hardware and software products covering the receipt of digital data streams to the processing of telemetry/command streams and the analysis of data, planning and scheduling, flight dynamics and data management.  Information on flight-proven software systems may also be provided.  This information is to be used by the NASA Constellation team to raise awareness of the current state of the practice in the area of commercial offerings. Responses must include the:  name and address of firm; size of business.  For commercial product, responses should include the product name and description and at least two examples of missions for which it is in current use.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder has consented to release of Proprietary information to NASA support service contractors.   This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action on this matter.  Further, neither NASA, nor the Government, will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. All responses to this RFI are due by May 15, 2007, to Mr. Keith Hutto by e-mail submittal to: keith.d.hutto@nasa.gov.  The Technical Point of Contact, Lisa Spence at 281-792-5859.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Guidance, Navigation and Control Flight Software Support for Exploration. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to identify sources interested in meeting the potential requirement and these sources' capabilities toward fulfilling the potential requirement.	The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be interpreted as any type of actual solicitation.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted in response to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to make any award on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for any information provided by respondents.  This notice is for market research purposes only and may not be indicative of the full requirement.  Should a requirement arise, the full requirement will be detailed in the solicitation. NASA Johnson Space Center’s Aeroscience and Flight Mechanics Division (EG) is seeking sources capable of and interested in providing engineering support.  This support shall consist of Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) Flight Software (FSW) and analysis support for Exploration Systems.  This work shall consist of engineering insight/oversight of prime contractor’s GN&C FSW for use in Exploration manned vehicle programs.  These programs currently consist of the Constellation Program’s production Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), known as Orion, and the CEV Flight Test Article (FTA), an ascent-abort flight test version of Orion.  In coming years, other Exploration vehicles and the International Space Station (ISS) may also require EG’s GN&C FSW involvement, since the CEV will be interfacing with those vehicles as part of its Design Reference Missions (DRM).  This support shall augment those capabilities provided by in-house resources. The NAICS Code and size standard for this requirement would be 541330 and $4.5 million, respectively. Specifically, this task may include: 1.	Provide insight/oversight of the GN&C Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCI) throughout the entire software development life cycle, including requirements, design, code, formal code inspection, unit testing, verification testing, integrated hardware/software testing, and maintenance.  Insight/oversight includes witnessing of formal verification and tests at the appropriate contractor or NASA facilities. 2.	Provide formal and informal inputs for the contractor and NASA products listed below, and ensure their correctness and completeness.  NASA’s concurrence responsibilities are noted below, as applicable: a.	Software Requirements Specification (concur) b.	Software Design Document  c.	Software Inspection and Peer Review Reports d.	Software Test Plan (concur) e.	Software Test Plan Description (concur) f.	Software Maintenance Plan g.	Software Users Manual h.	Software Version Description Document i.	Software Development Folder j.

Support the development and validation of the prime contractor avionics and software architecture.	Support is provided for integration of the GN&C CSCI. 4.	Conduct engineering analysis to validate requirements, design, implementation, and performance of the GN&C FSW and algorithms.  Such analyses will require use of NASA’s 6 Degree-of-Freedom (6DOF) high fidelity dynamics simulation environment.  This simulation environment will allow the Contractor to embed and evaluate the GN&C FSW and algorithms delivered by the prime contractor in both a non-real-time desktop setting as well as real-time in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) setting.  Such embedding would require the Contractor to be capable of modifying the simulation in order to integrate the GN&C FSW CSCI deliverables.	The HWIL setting will interface the simulation with flight-like Processors-in-the-Loop (PIL) using flight-like interfaces, in order to perform integrated hardware/software testing activities for independent assessment.  The HWIL lab will also include flight-equivalent unit (FEU) navigation hardware for high fidelity, integrated GN&C FSW testing.  The FEU hardware may include Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and Star Trackers (ST), which may be stimulated with the requisite stimulation devices in the loop, such as GPS signal generators and rate tables.   The Contractor will be required to work with the support team in conducting GN&C FSW tests in this lab environment. 5.	Support the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) tasks related to the performance and execution of the above FSW support tasks, including integration of the vehicles with other elements. The Government has deemed the following capabilities to be essential to the adequate performance of this task: 1)	A Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Rating of Level 3/ Staged or better 2)	Experience with in-flight, human-rated GN&C systems for human space, military aircraft, and/or commercial aircraft.  This experience shall consist of the following in terms of FSW development a.	FSW System Definition b.	FSW System Development c.	FSW System Test d.	FSW System Deployment (including operations and sustaining engineering) Experience with end-to-end FSW development on a single vehicle and as a lead developer and integrator would be considered beneficial. 3)	Experience with modern software development processes and either the same tools or functionally similar competitive tools as those used by the CEV prime contractor.  Specific areas of interest include: a.	Matlab/Simulink b.	C/C++ experience, both with manually-written code and autogenerated code from the Real Time Workshop Embedded Matlab Autocoder c.	UML Modeling and proficiency in UML Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool, such as Rational Rose, Tau, Kennedy-Carter iUML, Rhapsody, etc.) d.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and solicitation as no other solicitation document will be available. Current Qualified Specialists interested in this requirement must submit all of the information required within this notice and any amendments in order to be considered and evaluated for placement on the referenced Qualified Bidders List for future awards. As stated below there are qualification requirements that must be satisfied in order to be considered for evaluation. The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program has initiated a nationwide effort to help industrial facilities identify opportunities for saving energy, and thereby cut operating costs. To achieve this objective, DOE is sponsoring Energy Savings Assessments (ESAs) in large U.S. industrial plants to be conducted by Energy Savings Assessment Qualified Specialists, herein known as â€œESA Expertsâ€. ESAs will be conducted during calendar year 2007 and 2008 by DOE "Qualified Specialists" that are certified by DOE as ESA Experts and are listed on the DOE Qualified Bidders List for 2007 and 2008. Qualified Specialists are individuals who have satisfied the DOE Specialist Qualification training program requirements, and thus have demonstrated - by passing an examination - that they are proficient in the use of one or more of the DOE industrial systems software tools including AirMaster+ (AM+), Fan System Assessment Tool (FSAT), Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST), Pumping Systems Assessment Tool (PSAT), or the Steam System Assessment Tool Suite (SSAT). ESA Experts are individual â€œQualified Specialistsâ€ who have completed DOEâ€™s ESA Training; one-day Energy Savings Assessment Training session and a one-day â€œLessons Learnedâ€ workshop. The primary objective of the ESA is to identify opportunities for plant staff to improve the efficiency of their compressed air, fan, process heating, pumping, or steam systems. NOTE: The purpose of this announcement is to increase the number of available Qualified Specialists selected for the Qualified Bidders List. Those individuals / organizations already selected and placed on the QBL need not re-submit a response to this announcement. DOE, through this announcement, is soliciting â€œQualified Specialistsâ€ interested in becoming ESA Experts through attending training provided by DOE for certification as ESA Experts. Once certified, DOE will place the ESA Expert on a Qualified Bidders List (QBL) for future procurement opportunities in calendar years 2007 and 2008. Those ESA Experts on the QBL may be considered for individual awards for performing ESAâ€™s as determined by the Government. All current Qualified Specialists interested in being selected for the Qualified Bidders List of ESA Experts must submit a response to this notice and provide the following information for evaluation: a) Evidence of satisfactory completion of the DOE Specialist Qualification training program requirements (i.e. course completion certificate or equivalent), which demonstrates proficiency in the use of one or more of the DOE industrial system assessment tools including AirMaster+ (AM+), Fan System Assessment Tool (FSAT), Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST), Pumping Systems Assessment Tool (PSAT), or the Steam System Assessment Tool Suite (SSAT). This is a Qualification Requirement, and only those Qualified Specialists meeting this criterion will be considered and evaluated further. b) Provide a resume describing the technical qualifications, relevant experience, professional experience, education, background, accomplishments, specific training, studies and other pertinent information relative to the tasks necessary to perform the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for all proposed personnel. Note: this is limited to 5 pages. c) For each resume submitted, provide the number of previous assessments performed using the DOE Assessment Tool and a brief description of energy savings opportunities identified for each assessment. d) A description of past performance involving application of the DOE Assessment Tool(s) in industrial plants.

Until the Demonstrated Experience condition has been satisfied, such conditionally accepted applicants will not be allowed to perform an Energy Savings Assessment (ESA).  The Demonstrated Experience condition may be satisfied independently or via DOEâ€™s Mentoring Program. NOTE: All questions related to this notice / requirement and responses hereto must be submitted through the DOE IIPS System. Answers to all pertinent questions will be provided through the IIPS System.

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement and Factor 2 – Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a “go/no go” basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a “go” on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror’s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorable on past performance.

1.  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the smoking shelters with bins accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

“Descriptive literature” means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 – Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any “significant problems” encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  
NOTE:  All contractors MUST furnish a product of a small business manufacturer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST accept Government VISA Purchase Card.

All responsible small business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is May 1, 2007 – 2:00PM local time.

The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any “significant problems” encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is May 1, 2007 – 2:00PM local time.

The following provisions and clauses are incorporated into this RFP by reference and are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16, effective March 22, 2007.

		Technical Capability

		Price
Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
