<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to Artel Incorporated. The address is 25 Bradley Drive; Westbrook, ME 04092-2013. The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase the Artel Multichannel Verification System (MVS).
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) - Brand name required.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing). The size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>The Government intends to purchase a multichannel verification system needed by the Inorganic and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Branch (IRATB). Artel Incorporated's multichannel verification system is used to verify the accuracy and precision of the volumes dispensed by the IRATB's Biomek liquid handling station used for the PATH project urine trace elements analysis. CDC believes that Artel Incorporated is the only source available with the product that provides the means to validate the volume accuracy and precision of IRATB's Biomek liquid handling systems.</p>
<p>Having this system will allow IRATB to perform their verification and identify problems each time there is a question about the accuracy of the sample preparation station. The Artel system uses solutions that are traceable to the National Institutes of Science and Technology (NIST) and unlike other methods for performing volume verification, the accuracy and precision of each individual dispensing point is tested. This system is the only complete, in-house system which allows for calibration verification of the Division of Laboratory Sciences liquid handling platforms using NIST traceable standards.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Artel Incorporated. Artel Incorporated is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Tim Williams via email to TLWilliams3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2017-Q-66995 in the subject line, no later than 8:00am Eastern Time, June 26, 2017.</p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Office, Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA or BIE does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIE Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIE if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA and BIE, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIE Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIE if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 

52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items.
EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

3.  Past Performance

All evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Submit detailed information for each evaluation factor.

Responses for each evaluation factor will need to be submitted with your proposal.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following additional FAR and DFARS clauses are applicable to this acquisition:</p>
<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC>THIS IS A BUY INDIAN SET ASIDE:

Amendment No.: 0001 is for Solicitation No.: A17PS00688 as follows:

To include Buy Indian Clauses that were omitted by mistake:

1. 1480.102 Buy Indian Act acquisition regulations.
(a) This part supplements Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Department of the Interior Acquisition Regulation (DIAR) requirements to satisfy the needs of Indian Affairs in implementing the Buy Indian Act.
(b) This part is under the direct oversight and control of the Chief Financial Officer, within the Office of the Assistant Secretary¿Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior (CFO). The CFO is responsible for issuing and implementing this part.

The provisions of the FAR take precedence in all instances where there may be a conflict or discrepancy.


2. Indian Preference  (APR 1984) 1452.226-70 

(a) The Contractor agrees to give preferences to Indians who can perform the work required regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, religion, or tribal affiliation for training and employment opportunities under this contract and, to the extent feasible consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, training and employment preferences and opportunities shall be provided to Indians regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, religion, or tribal affiliation who are not fully qualified to perform under this contract. The Contractor also agrees to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in the awarding of any subcontracts consistent with the efficient performance of this contract. The Contractor shall maintain such records as are necessary to indicate compliance with this paragraph.

(b) In connection with the Indian employment preference requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall also provide opportunities for training incident to such employment. Such training shall include on-the-job, classroom, or apprenticeship training which is designed to increase the vocational effectiveness of an Indian employee.

(c) If the Contractor is unable to fill its training and employment needs after giving full consideration to Indians as required by this clause, those needs may be satisfied by selection of persons other than Indians in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled "Equal Opportunity."

(d) If no Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises are available for awarding of subcontracts in connection with the work performed under this contract, the Contractor agrees to comply with the provisions of this contract involving utilization of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, or labor surplus area concerns. 

(e) As used in this clause:

(1) "Indian" means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe. If the Contractor has reason to doubt that a person seeking employment preference is an Indian, the contractor shall grant the preference but shall require the individual within thirty (30) days to provide evidence from the Tribe concerned that the person is a member of that Tribe.

(2) "Indian organization" means the governing body of any Indian Tribe or entity established or recognized by such governing body in accordance with the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77; 25 U.S.C. 1451); and

(3) "Indian-owned economic enterprise" means any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit provided that such Indian ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise. 

(4) "Indian Tribe" means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 668; 43 U.S.C. 1601) which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

(f) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of the clause including this paragraph (f) in each subcontract awarded under this contract.

(g) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contractor's right to proceed may be terminated in whole or in part by the Contracting Officer and the work completed in a manner determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the best interests of the Government.



3. Indian Preference Program  (APR 1984) 1452.226-71 

(a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract entitled "Indian Preference -- Department of the Interior," the Contractor agrees to establish and conduct an Indian preference program which will expand the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts and which will expand opportunities for Indians to receive preference for training and employment in connection with the work to be performed under this contract. In this connection, the Contractor shall --

(1) Designate a liaison officer who will:

1. maintain liaison with the Government and Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters; 

2. supervise compliance with the provisions of this clause; and 

3. administer the Contractor's Indian preference program. 

(2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants will be given preference in employment and training incident to such employment.

(3) Not less than twenty (20) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of any reservations on which or near where the work under this contract is to be performed, which sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate number and types of employees needed, the approximate dates of employment; the experience or special skills required for employment, if any; training opportunities available; and all other pertinent information necessary to advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements. The Contractor shall also request the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work is to be performed to provide assistance to the Contractor in filling its employment needs and training opportunities. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact in regard to the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance.

(4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the Contractor shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities by soliciting bids or proposals only from Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. The Contractor shall request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be performed. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the  Tribal officials to be contacted in regard to the request for assistance and information. Public notices and solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by including --

1. a clear description of the supplies or services required including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules which facilitate the participation of Indian firms; 

2. a statement indicating the preference will be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in accordance with Section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638; (88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b)); 

3. definitions for the terms "Indian organization" and "Indian-owned economic enterprise" as prescribed under the "Indian Preference -- Department of the Interior" clause of this contract; 

4. a representation to be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and

(v) a closing date for receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after soliciting bids from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, no responsible bid is received, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the "Indian Preference -- Department of the Interior" clause of this contract. If one or more responsible bids are received, award shall be made to the low responsible bidder if the bid price is determined to be reasonable. If the low responsive bid is determined to be unreasonable as to price, the Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. If a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the "Indian Preference -- Department of the Interior" clause of the contract.

(5) Maintain written records under this contract which indicate:

1. the names and addresses of all Indians seeking employment for each employment position available under this contract; 

2. the number and types of positions filled by (A) Indians and (B) non-Indians, and the name, address and position of each Indian employed under this contract; 

3. for those positions where there are both Indian and non-Indian applicants, and a non-Indian is selected for employment, the reason(s) why the Indian applicant was not selected; 

4. actions taken to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises for subcontracting opportunities which exist under this contract; 

5. reasons why preference was not given to Indian firms as subcontractors or suppliers for each requirement where it was determined by the Contractor that such preference would not be consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, and 

6. the names and addresses of all Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises (A) contacted, and (B) receiving subcontract awards under this contract. 

(6) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a semiannual report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian preference program and indicates (i) the number and types of available positions filled and dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to (a) Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises and (b) all other firms.

(7) Records maintained pursuant to this clause will be kept available for review by the Government until expiration of one (1) year after final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as may be required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or regulation.

(b) For purpose of this clause, the following definitions of terms shall apply:

(1) The terms "Indian," "Indian Tribe," "Indian Organization, and "Indian-owned economic enterprise" are defined in the clause of this contract entitled "Indian Preference."

(2) "Indian reservation" includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations on Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, (85 Stat. 688;  43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).

(3) "On or near an Indian Reservation" means on a reservation or reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day. 

(c) Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall be interpreted to preclude Indian Tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not hinder the Government's right to award contracts  and to administer their provisions.

(d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause including this paragraph (d) in each subcontract awarded under this contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such subcontracts.

(e) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contractor's right to proceed may be terminated in whole or in part by the Contracting Officer and the work completed in a manner determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the best interest of the Government.

(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.

(2) A description of the source of human resources for the work to be performed by the offeror;
(3) A description of the method(s) of recruiting and training Indian employees, indicating the extent of soliciting employment of Indian persons, as required by DIAR 1452.226-70, Indian Preference, or DIAR 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program, clause(s);
(4) A description of how subcontractors (if any) will be selected in compliance with the ¿Indian Preference¿ or ¿Indian Preference Program¿ clause(s);

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: (i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and (ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

These electronic documents may be copied, as needed, to provide multiple individuals access to the documents. See file access procedures above for steps to allow individuals to access (open) the secure solicitation files.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />****UPDATED INFORMATION AS OF 28 APRIL 2017****<br /><br />In regards to the type or level of software certificate, <strong>MEDIUM</strong> level is sufficient as long as it is an <strong>ECA CERTIFICATE.</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />****UPDATED INFORMATION as of 19 APR 2017****<br /><br />In order to receive a DVD containing the solicitation documents, the Contract Specialist (Donna Larson) must have received the below information as stated in the pre-solicitation:

The DVD's provided cannot be duplicated. Any duplicates will be un-usable. The authentication process identified for receipt of solicitation documents is required before access will be granted to the information on the DVD.</p>
<p>1. Offerors shall register for the project on the Federal Business Opportunities (https://www.fbo.gov/) website to be added to the planholders list (this is necessary to develop a planholders list for prime contractors, sub-contractors, and suppliers). Registration on the Planholders list does not automatically qualify the registrant to receive a DVD (See procedures below).</p>
<p>2. Prospective contractors shall submit the two forms listed below in order to receive a solicitation DVD from the Government. Email completed forms to: CENWO.WSMF@usace.army.mil</p>

Each DVD will be marked as "DoD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information" and have an identification number assigned to it.</p>

Review and approval of the request form will be performed by the Government prior to granting contractor access to view the solicitation plans and specifications on the DVD.</p>
