<DESC><p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make an award to JP Morgan Chase Bank 1776 I Street NW, Suite 800 Washington DC 20006. The company will continue to provide Premium Lockbox service. PBGC is in the process of converting to Premium Practitioner System (PPS). Switching to a new lockbox contractor after having worked with the JP Morgan Chase lockbox contractor through system development and conversion would cause a disruption and potentially impact the quality of data being converted into PPS. <br />JP Morgan Chase Bank was working closely with the system developer in testing the transmission of daily bank statement date. The current contract is due to expire 9/30/2008 shortly before PBGC's peak premium filing season which begins 10/15/2008. During that time PBGC expects to receive approximately 15,000 premium filings. A change in the premium lockbox bank contractor would result in a change in the premium lockbox address and will confuse our customers (practitioners) before our peak filing month of October 2008. Our current lockbox address is listed on the PBGC web site and was included in our premium instruction booklets which were mailed out to our practitioners. A change in the lockbox Contractor at fiscal year end will also cause potentially a delay in processing peak season filings and payments in October 2008 as we attempt to integrate the existing data capture process with the new bank's lockbox process. PBGC has an automated wire transfer process that has been custom programmed to work with JP Morgan Chase's system. <br />An interested party may e-mail a written capability statement with sufficient experience for these required services, which shall not exceed 3 pages in length. Capability statements must be e-mailed to Miller.Mark@pbgc.gov and received no later than 3:00 PM EDT on September 16, 2008.</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  We anticipate posting the solicitation on or about September 16, 2008 with a due date/time of 3 p.m. EDT on September 23, 2008.

Please note that the successful offeror must provide a sampling of 1 or 2 articles published in academic or professional journals as part of its proposal.  Proposals lacking this will be rejected without further consideration.

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks a contractor with extensive experience teaching leadership and ethics to senior level officials in government to create an individualized ethics and leadership program for PBGC.  The contractor must work with designated OGC staff to develop an Ethics and Leadership Training Program for the PBGC.  In the first phase, the contractor will develop a program for senior level managers.  The program should be designed to be taught incrementally over the course of FY09 so as to keep ethics and leadership in the daily lexicon of the corporate environment.  A second phase of the program, to be developed after the senior level training is underway, will focus attention on non-senior level managers.  For this program, the contractor will work with OGC staff to develop appropriate materials, but the primary responsibility for facilitation of the training sessions will reside with the OGC staff attorneys.  

PBGC, an independent federal agency, protects the retirement incomes of 44.1 million American workers in 30,330 private-sector defined benefit pension plans.   PBGCs Strategic Plan FY 2008 - 2013 (Corporate Strategic Plan) incorporates ethics as an integral part of the Agencys strategic priorities. The guiding principle for the Strategic Plan, is that PBGC is a performance-based organization that values professionalism, integrity, [and] high ethical standards . .  . .  In order to maintain the guiding principle, Agency officials identified strategic priorities to address the challenges of the next five years.  Two of those priorities are to: conduct business with professionalism and integrity and meet the highest ethical standards. The outcome objective for these priorities is to develop a workforce trained to meet the highest ethical standards in order to ensure that decisions are informed by public and not private interests.  To accomplish these objectives, the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is developing an Ethics and Leadership Training Program that will be presented in phases to managers of the Corporation.

On a case-by-case basis, the Contractor shall perform additional retroviral assays, and/or tests of a molecular level to confirm positivity.  The Navy estimates ordering approximately 60,000 to 70,000 specimens per month for initial HIV-1 ELISA screening from approximately 1300 submitting activities, of which not more than one percent will require confirmatory or supplemental testing.  The period of performance for the resultant extension will consist of a two (2) month base period, commencing 01 October 2008, plus an additional one-month option to extend the term the resultant contract extension through no later than 31 December 2008, if the option is exercised.  Issuance of a Firm Fixed Price contract extension is anticipated. The proposed contract action is for services whi! ch the Government intends to solicit with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Womens Health (OWH) requires the professional services of a pediatrician and adolescent specialist to provide expertise and guidance in its mission to serve the interests of adolescent girls.  During the past decade, up to September 2007, there was a full-time presence of pediatric/adolescent expertise at OWH.  During Fiscal Year 2008 the OWH contracted for the services of a pediatric/adolescent presence.  The OWH plans negotiate on a sole source basis for these services with Jonelle Rowe, M.D., 1015 33rd Street, NW, Washington, DC 20007 for Fiscal Year 2009.  The period of performance is one year from date of award for approximately 520 hours.  Specifically, the contractor shall (1) Work with OWH to develop an age appropriate strategic plan for implementation and roll out of bone health for its bone health effort; (2) Work with OWH communication division to review the ongoing content of the girls health website for medical accuracy and age appropriateness; (3) Work with OWH as it continues to implement the Body Works Obesity Prevention Program; particularly the Spanish version as well as work with the Indian Health Service on the implementation of the Native American version; (4) Work with OWH in administering their evaluation contract of the Body Works Obesity Prevention Program; (5) Assist OWH in developing the Anticipatory Guidance materials for Hispanic parent/families of adolescent girls, reviewing all materials for medical accuracy; (6) Work with OWH as it rolls out the soon to be completed Anticipatory Guidance materials for African American parents/families; (7) Provide adolescent expertise for other issues that arise as the OWH continues to work on girls health; and (8) Work with OWH on medical issues of maternal and child health, as needed.  This requirement will be awarded using FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold.  Dr. Rowe has been justified as a sole source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) because she is uniquely qualified due to her 10 years as a pediatric expert in the Office on Womens Health where she played a crucial part in the development and oversight of virtually all the programs on adolescent health in the office.  She had a leading role in the creation and on-going success of Body Wise, an eating disorder awareness campaign, the Body Works Toolkit, an obesity prevention program, the girls health website, the media literacy and youth development campaign and the anticipatory guidance program for parents of adolescent girls.  During the past year the OWH has taken over the Powerful Bones, Powerful Girls campaign from the CDC and Dr. Rowe has played a pivotal role in this process and will continue to be a significant member of the campaign as it moves forward.  In addition to her adolescent health policy expertise, she has specific research and clinical background on the problem of calcium needs of children and adolescents because of her experience before joining the Federal Government and more recently in her collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  This position requires a state licensed, board certified pediatrician with significant experience in working at the Federal level developing public health programs dealing with adolescent girls health, specifically experience working on issues of eating disorders, body image, self esteem, obesity prevention, media literacy and youth development and counseling parents of adolescent girls.  Additionally knowledge of medical issues concerning maternal and infant health issues would be an asset.  The pediatrician must be able to interact effectively with members of the Society of Adolescent Medicine and other health professionals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement addressing their experience in the field of adolescent girls issues, medical credentials and ability to provide the services set forth above.  There is no solicitation.  All responses must be e-mailed to msunday@psc.gov no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time, September 28, 2008.  All submissions shall be reviewed by the Government and be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Jacksonville District intends to award a HUBZone sole source contract to B+B Dredging Company utilizing negotiated procedures for work which consists of the rental of a Coast Guard Certified Hopper Dredge for maintenance dredging at Palm Beach Harbor, Florida.  This requirement is proposed as a sole source procurement to a certified HUBZone firm under the authority of the HUBZone Act of 1997 (15 U.S.C. 631) and FAR 19.1306.  Justification document has been prepared and approved in accordance with FAR 6.302-5, FAR 6.303 and FAR 6.304.  Market research was performed in accordance with FAR Part 10 and a determination has been made that B+B Dredging is the only Certified HUBZone firm which owns a Coast Guard Certified Hopper Dredge.  This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals.  If there are businesses that can provide the aforementioned services and can meet the minimum requirements contained herein, they must respond by submitting, in writing, an expression of interest in competing on this procurement and provide supporting documentation as to their capabilities to meet these requirements not later than 29 September 2008.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Bid Schedule for the maintenance dredging at Palm Beach Harbor will contain a Base Bid and two optional bid items as follows:  (1) Base Bid will consist of work to be accomplished during the turtle window with dredged material being placed on the beach, weather permitting, otherwise it will be placed in the nearshore disposal area; (2) Option A work will be accomplished outside of the turtle window and all dredged material will be placed in the nearshore disposal area; and (3) Option B will be exercised should the need arise for additional dredging outside of the turtle window.  Magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The Request for Proposal will be issued to B+B Dredging Company on or about 1 October 2008 with the proposal due on or about 15 October 2008.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE HUBZONE ACQUISITION.  NAICS Code is 237990 and the Small Business size standard is $20 million.  NOTE:  To be considered small for purposes of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small business firm.<BR><BR>

PART I - SECTION C  STATEMENT OF WORK 

1.0	Background Effective program management is at the core of FAA's ability to deliver the right products and services on time and within budget.  FAA program managers hold primary responsibility for ensuring that FAA gets the products and services it needs, on-time and within budget.
Agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Accounting Office (GAO), have cited project manager capabilities as a material weakness in delivering projects on time, within budget and scope, and achieving target performance levels.  
The FAA's Office of Information Services and Chief Information Officer (AIO) is developing a Program Management Certification Program that supports program managers on major programs in attaining their PMP certification.  AIO needs to "fast track" a group of 20 individuals to gain Project Management Institute certification.  
2.0	Scope FAA requires the services of a contract vendor to provide off-the-shelf classroom training on the principles and concepts contained in the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).
The vendor must provide flexibility in both the length and the dates of the training.  The vendor may propose courses of alternate lengths.  No course shall be less than [2] days or greater than [5] days.  
FAA will require training for up to [20] individuals over the next [8] months.  FAA envisions sending approximately [20] individuals to training during the 8 month time frame.  These individuals may attend the closed training course offered by the vendor.
3.0	Deliverables The vendor will deliver training sessions at vendor site. Each training session must accommodate approximately [20] FAA personnel.  
Workshop Timeframe: September 2008 through September 2009
All courses will be delivered in a facility secured by the vendor, located in the Washington DC area, and accessible via [metro, train].
The vendor will provide end-of-class evaluations that assess the quality of content, instructors, learning environment, perception of knowledge gained, structure, format, and job applicability.  
The vendor will furnish all instructors, materials, equipment/supplies, and services necessary to successfully conduct the training sessions. 
At the conclusion of the training, participants should be thoroughly prepared to take the PMI certification exam.

4.0	Task Description The audience for this training is FAA program managers/future program managers with a need to thoroughly understand PMI's PMBOK for successful completion of PMI's PMP certification exam.
The following provides more specific details about the project requirements:
o  FAA requests an all-inclusive, per person cost for instructor-led off-the-shelf training.  If the vendor offers courses of alternative lengths, an all-inclusive per person cost should be provided for each.
o  The all-inclusive price per person must cover all the vendors' costs, including but not limited to:  instructors, materials, supplies, and instructor travel costs (including room and board).  FAA will not be required to pay any additional fees or expenses beyond the per person cost.
The following information must be provided for each course proposed by the vendor:o  Length of each course,o  Outline of the course content,o  Agenda for each day of the course,o  Bios for the instructors for each course.
The vendor shall also provide:	3 past performance references for work with organizations involving comparable instructional material (content) and experience acquiring a flexible contract similar to this requirement.	Statistics on the types and number of program management-related courses taught in the last calendar year.	Statistics on the certification attainment.  
Timeframe and Location:  All training sessions will be held at vendor's location in the Washington, DC area.  Facilities:  Vendor shall arrange/procure all meeting space. Number of Participants:  Maximum of [20] individuals.  
Participant Materials:  Vendor shall provide, as part of the inclusive cost of the training, participant materials to enhance and reinforce learning.  Vendor will be responsible for producing and delivering the materials to the session.  The materials should include an agenda and end-of-course evaluation survey.

H.4  CONFIDENTIALLITY OF DATA AND INFORMATION The Contractor and any consultants in the performance of this contract may have a need for access to and use of various types of data and information in the possession of the Government, which the Government obtained under conditions which restrict the Government's right to use and disclose the data and information, or which may be of a nature that its dissemination or use other than in the performance of this contract, would be adverse to the interests of the Government or other parties.  Therefore, the Contractor and any consultants should abide by any restrictive use conditions on such data and not:	Knowingly disclose such data or information to others without written authorization from the Contracting Officer, unless that data or information has otherwise become available to the public through no action or fault of the Contractor; and	Use for any purpose other than the performance of this contract that data which bears a restrictive marking or legend, unless such information or data has otherwise fallen into the public domain through no action or fault of the Contractor.In the event the work required to be performed under this contract requires access to proprietary data of other companies, the Contractor shall obtain agreement from such other companies for such use unless such data is provided or made available to the Contractor by the Government.  Two copies of such company-to-company agreements shall be furnished promptly to the Contracting Officer for the Government's information.  These agreements shall prescribe the scope of authorized use of disclosure, and other terms and conditions to be agreed upon between the parties thereto.  It is agreed by the Contractor that any such data, whether obtained by the Contractor pursuant to the agreement or from the Government shall be protected from unauthorized use of disclosure to any individual, corporation, or organization so long as it remains proprietary.The Contractor agrees to make employees aware of the requirement to maintain confidentiality of data and/or information, and in the necessity to refrain from divulging either the proprietary data of other companies or data that is obtained from the Government to anyone except as authorized.  The Contractor shall obtain from each employee, engaged in any effort connected with this contract, an agreement, in writing, which shall in substance provide that such employee will not, during his/her employment by the Contractor, or thereafter, disclose to others or use for his/her own benefit of any individual, any trade secrets, confidential information or proprietary/restricted data (to include Government "For Official Use Only") received in connection with the work under this contract unless such information otherwise falls in to the public domain through no action or fault of the Contractor or employee.The Contractor agrees to hold the Government harmless and to indemnify the Government as to any cost/loss resulting from the unauthorized use or disclosure of third party data or software by the Contractor, its employees, consultants, or other agents of any kind.The Contractor agrees to include to the substance of this provision in all subcontracts, including consultant and lecturer subcontracts, awarded under this contract.  The Contracting Officer will consider case-by-case exceptions from this requirement for individual subcontracts in the event that (1) the Contractor considers the application of the prohibitions of this provision to be inappropriate and unnecessary in the case of particular subcontract; (2) the subcontractor provides a written statement affirming absolute unwillingness to perform absent some relief from the substance of this prohibition; (3) use of an alternate subcontract source would unreasonably detract from the quality of effort; and (4) the Contractor provides the Contracting Officer timely, written, advance notice of these and any other extenuating circumstances.Except as the Contracting Officer specifically authorizes in writing, upon completion of all work under the contract, the Contractor shall return all data and information obtained from the Government, including all copies, modification, adaptations, or combinations thereof, to the Contracting Officer.  Data obtained from other companies shall be disposed of in accordance with the Contactor's agreement with that company, or, if the agreement makes no provision for disposition, shall be returned to that company.  The Contractor shall further certify in writing to the Contracting Officer that all copies, modifications, adaptations, or combinations thereof of data or information, which cannot reasonably be returned to the Contracting Officer (or to a company) have been deleted from the Contractor's (or subcontractor's) records and destroyed.  These restrictions do not limit the Contractor's (or subcontractor's) right to use and disclose any data or information obtained from other sources without restriction.Work performed under this contract may involve access to information (including but not limited to specifications, engineering requirements, cost estimates, and other sensitive data) relating to but in advance of acquisition actions.

"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts for the same parent concern. 
"Registered in the CCR database" means that the Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database. 
(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 
  (2) The offeror shall enter, in Representations, Certifications and Other Statements of Offerors Section of the solicitation, the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 
(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 
  (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number    (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com/; or     (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.     (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in AMS Procurement Guidance T3.10.1.A-8, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:

  (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims. Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov/ or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

3.3.1-34 	Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer/Central Contractor Registration (October 2005) (a) Method of payment.      (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.     (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either?         (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or         (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.       (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for?                (i) Making a correct payment;                (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and                (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.     (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and?               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or              (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

M. 2 Evaluation Criteria
Factor 1: Tiered Evaluation
A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in source selection and offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number from responsible small business concerns were received.  The evaluation order of precedence is (descending order):
(a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) program.(b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business(SDVOB);(c)	Very small businesses;(d)	Small businesses; and(e)	Other than small business.
Factor 2:  (go/no go basis)
In order to be considered for award, the Offeror must demonstrate that it has performed successfully on at least three projects of similar size, scope and complexity to this requirement within the past three years.  This is a pass/fail requirement and Offerors that fail to demonstrate that they have met these minimum experience requirements may be rejected, at the Government's discretion, for award without further consideration. 
Offeror's that are able to demonstrate that they have met these minimum experience requirements will be evaluated further based on the extent to which they represent capabilities in the areas of expertise as defined in the Statement of Work.  Offerors will be scored on the following basis:

Factor 3:  (go/no basis)
In order to be considered for award, an Offeror must provide additional coaching and/or  training, at no cost, for participants that do not successfully complete the PMI Certification Examination. Offerors must also agree to absorb the costs for additional examination fees (up to three times) for any individual that does not successfully complete the PMI Certification Examination.

M.3 Price Evaluation Process
Price will not be numerically scored.  The Contracting Officer will make a determination that the Offerors' price is fair and reasonable prior to award.  A price is "reasonable" if it does not exceed that which a prudent person would pay in the conduct of a competitive business.  When determining reasonableness, the FAA will perform a price analysis.

Alturas Analytical has previously developed and validated assays for pyridostigmine bromide (PB) in biological samples, plasma and tissue under good laboratory practices (GLP) conditions. At the time of solicitation of the initial contract, no other vendors were capable of providing the service required in the time frame required.  The current purchase request is an extension of the original effort in that samples form non-human primates will be submitted for analysis of PB levels in plasma and tissue under validated, GLP protocols.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated required product within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to this office within five (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated product within the established timeframe.  Information can be sent to the Purchasing Agent, Gay Hayden, at gay.hayden@us.army.mil.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated, however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: (Hawaii): $1.37 per hour, or $54.80 per week, or $237.47 per month hour for all employees on whose behalf the contractor provides health care benefits pursuant to the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act. For those employees who are not receiving health care benefits mandated by the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act, the new health and welfare benefit rate will be $3.24 per hour.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:<br />The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<br />The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<br />REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}<br />Conformance Process:<br />The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<br />The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br />1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br />2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<br />3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br />4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<br />5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<br />6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br />Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: (Hawaii): $1.37 per hour, or $54.80 per week, or $237.47 per month hour for all employees on whose behalf the contractor provides health care benefits pursuant to the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act. For those employees who are not receiving health care benefits mandated by the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act, the new health and welfare benefit rate will be $3.24 per hour.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br />A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br />If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:<br />The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<br />The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<br />REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}<br />Conformance Process:<br />The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<br />The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br />1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br />2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<br />3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br />4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<br />5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<br />6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br />Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<br />When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.The proposed contract action is for an Alpha Omega Microguide system for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1  'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements'.  The use of a brand name specification is essential to the Government's requirements and precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The Alpha Omega MicroGuide system is an electrophysiology system used by neurosurgeons to perform brain mapping during surgeries to implant deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into patients with movement disorders like Parkinson's disease.  The San Francisco VAMC is the largest volume center in the country performing these surgeries.  While there are other companies that manufacture DBS electrophysiology systems, the Microguide has unique features and capabilities critical to the VAs requirement.  The VA requires an electrophysiology system that can provide the ability to perform microstimulation and have multiple channels for recording from the brain as well as EMG sensors, accelerometers, and other peripheral devices that are used during surgery.  In addition, the system must perform reliable real-time signal analysis in the operating room and have the ability to move an electrode to the desired position in the brain using an infinitely adjustable positioning stage. Only the Alpha Omega Microguide will meet all the requirements stated. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received prior to September 18, 2008 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This solicitation VA-261-08-RQ-0365 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26. Only emailed requests received directly from the requester are acceptable.

Designed specifically for use with Nikon D1/D2-series and D100 digital SLR cameras, it features wideangle zoom capability, ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass and Nikon's exclusive built-in SWM (Silent Wave Motor). The lens is targeted at professional and advanced amateur Nikon D-SLR users who demand both the advantages of high optical performance and wideangle focal zoom range.This G-type Nikkor lens is designed with no aperture rings, and offers easier, virtually mistake-free operation because the aperture does not need to be set to minimum. Equivalent focal length in 35mm is 25.5-85.5mm.

It is a very robust and durable lens. Its lightweight construction incorporates a magnesium die-cast barrel, and professional-grade dust and moisture sealing allows it to be used in more rugged situations. This lens features the improved Vibration Reduction (VR II) system that allows handheld telephoto shooting, even in less-than-ideally lit conditions. The VR system minimizes image blur caused by camera shake, and offers the equivalent of shooting at a shutter speed of about 4 stops faster. In addition, this lens also features the Tripod Detection mode, which reduces vibration that may occur due to shutter release, when mounted on a tripod. The Silent Wave Motor (SWM) feature provides swift autofocus with superior accuracy and ultra-quiet operation. This G-type lens does not feature an aperture ring on the lens body, resulting in a lighter and more compact lens. Aperture changes are designed to be done via the camera's command dial. Note: VR function is only compatible with Nikon's F5, F100, N80, N65, D70, D100 & D1-series (or later generation) cameras.AF-S feature is not supported by certain older camera models.
