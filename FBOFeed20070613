The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contract Specialist by e-mail (rpaprocki@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.

<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure, on a sole-source basis, with the University of Washington (UW). The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 235(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), requires research to test a hypothesis that ocean survival of salmon may depend on growth during their first summer at sea.  To date, this hypothesis has not been critically tested due to the considerable cost of sampling salmon in the ocean and the difficulties of actually measuring salmon growth at sea.  Recently, studies have suggested that blood levels of the hormone IGF-I may provide a reliable index of the instantaneous growth rate of salmon.  There are two goals for this project.  One is to collect more data on the levels of IGF I in juvenile salmon collected off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia in relation to oceanographic conditions in these areas.  The second is to analyze the plasma samples for IGF I and 11-ketotestosterone (index of male maturity).  The period of performance will be one year.

The only known source to perform the required work is the School of Fishery and Aquatic Sciences (SAFS), University of Washington.

It is the intent of this BAA to leverage these investments to investigate and demonstrate new technologies capable of reducing fuel consumption, improving power conversion efficiency, and to a lesser extent, increase installed power generation density on the USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51)  Flight IIA Class ships.  Fuel is used by installed ship propulsion prime movers and ship electrical generation prime movers.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of technologies capable of reducing the consumption of fuel, improving power generation conversion efficiency, and to a lesser extent, leading to greater installed power generation density, though the latter need not be a requirement.  The components and systems of interest potentially include but are not limited to: 

Power Generation
1.) Gas Turbine Engine/Generator
2.) Alternate Power Generation Technologies
3.) Energy Storage to enable efficient and reliable operation
4.) Energy Recovery Sub-systems/components

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific intends to issue a sole source modification to existing Southeast Asia Multi-Function Support (SEAMS) Services contract, N62742-00-D-5001 with Defense Support Services Singapore Pte Ltd (DS2).  The modification to this Fixed-Price w/IQ provisions contract will extend the present period of performance for OY7 (FY08) from 10 months to 12 months.  Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would create substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short term extension.  The modification will also increase the maximum amount to be procured under the IQ provisions from $761k to $3.1Mil.  The projected IQ work includes, but is not limited to: relocating and renovating various office spaces, relocate HAZMAT lockers, minor landscaping, repair flooring in warehouse, and renovate laundry rooms in family housing.  The modification is being executed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Semiconductor Electronics Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with MBraun, Inc., for the purchase of an external solvent removal system for an MBraun Unilab Glove Box.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes an MBraun Unilab Glove Box, which includes an internal solvent removal system.  The current system is not sufficient to adequately protect the components of the Glove Box from corrosive chemicals.  The purchase of an external solvent removal system is an upgrade and will be integrated with the existing Glove Box.  Therefore, the upgrade must be 100 percent compatible with the existing Glove Box.  MBraun, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 28, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for spaceflight qualified, radiation hardened DC/DC converters and spaceflight qualified radiation hardened filters. The Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI) project has the unique opportunity to place engineering measurement devices on the heatshield of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) vehicle, scheduled for launch in 2009.  Obtaining valuable data about the Mars entry environment will help validate aerothermal and ablative materials models, lowering the risk for future robotic and human missions to Mars. The instrument complement for MEDLI includes temperature, ablation, and pressure measurement devices.  The Sensor Support Electronics (SSE) unit, mounted on the MSL Aeroshell, conditions the signals from various sensors, performs the analog to digital conversion, and passes serial data to the Rover.  16 volts DC to 40 volts DC unconditioned power is supplied to the SSE by MSL must be converted to +/-15 volts DC and +5 volts DC using spaceflight qualified DC/DC converters and filters.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the DC/DC converters and filters from Interpoint Corporation as they are the only known source that can provide the DC/DC converters and filters that meets all of NASA LaRC's specifications. The SMHF2815DF/KP DC/DC converter input voltage is from 16 volts DC to 40 volts DC which is converted to an output of +/- 15 volts DC and the SMSA2805S/KP converter input voltage is from 16 volts DC to 40 volts DC which is converted to an output of +5V. DC/DC converters, filters as well as other electronic systems, experience extraordinary stresses during space flight.  The SMHF2815DF/00 space prototype DC/DC converters and the SMSA2805S/00 space prototype DC/DC converters have the same electrical characteristics as the spaceflight version and have not been qualified for spaceflight but are necessary for engineering printed circuit board development. The spaceflight converters and filter must withstand extremes in temperature, pressure (vacuum), and radiation environmental conditions. These low-power, high reliability spacelfight DC/DC converters and filters are on the Qualified Parts List (QPL) fully certified and qualified to the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) to the highest level of spaceflight rated components, Class K. The spaceflight and prototype DC/DC converters and filters are screened at the component level by Interpoint to the DSCC standards for class K rating.  Component level screening tests includes electrical checkouts, visual inspections, constant acceleration, temperature cycling, burn-in, post burn-in electrical, steady state life, voltage conditioning and wire bond evaluation.  This will ensure that the DC/DC converters and filters will meet the extreme conditions of spaceflight for this Project’s Mission Assurance Requirements.  Authority for the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is provided by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (PL 104-106, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as amended by PL 109-163, Section 1443 of the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act). This authority is available for use in acquiring commercial items not exceeding $5.5 million. Interpoint is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 19, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) began a project in 2005 to convert its network database management system (IDMS) to a modern relational management system (DB2).  This project is expected to be completed by September 2007.  The RRB?s body of data was redefined to fit the new DB2 management system.  This resulted in the development of data tables containing data that used to be stored independently in each application.  Some data, particularly identifying information, existed in each separate database, having separate sources and uses.   The new environment houses all the data in tables that co-exist in the same environment, making comparisons easy and apparent redundancy noticeable.  While the conversion itself is expeditious, it does not address the duplicate data which will become very apparent and will counteract the efficiency of the new relational database management system.  The RRB is seeking sources to provide data optimization services which will include, but not be limited to, eliminating multiple representations of the same data, redefining data that is apparently the same but has subtle differences, and documenting the data.  Potential offers should send an e-mail or letter of interest to Ms. Velinda Nix, at U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, Acquisition Management, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, IL, 60611 or Velinda.nix@rrb.gov to be added to the bidder?s list.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Director General, Office National de l'Assainissement du Senegal, Direction Generale cite TP SOM n?4 Hann, Dakar, Senegal Phone: (221) 832-35-33 Fax: (221) 832-35-31 Feasibility Study: Corniche West Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the viability of wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the city of Dakar.  

Economic development and growth in Senegal has not always considered environmental issues in planning and implementation.  Urbanization and industrialization has contributed significantly to the scale of pollution in the country, particularly in urban areas such as Dakar.  Like many other countries in the region, considerable catch-up is required before public infrastructure elements such as water supply, sewerage and storm drainage are capable of supporting economic and urban growth, reducing poverty and enabling sustainable development.

In March 2005, the Government of Senegal (GoS) published a Sectoral Policy Letter for Urban and Rural Water and Sanitation. The intent of this publication was to document the progress that had been made in Senegal in achieving the objectives for poverty reduction associated with the Millennium Development Goals - the UN blueprint for poverty reduction by 2015.  Through its sectoral policy letter, the GoS has identified that the urban sanitation sector within the country faces a number of significant constraints. This includes the fact that the number of households that have access to proper sanitation facilities is significantly less than those that have access to water supply.  

To improve the urban sanitation situation, the GoS has given this sector a high priority, and established a strategy which has four main elements, namely: 
-The development of effective organizational and institutional frameworks for both water supply and sanitation services;
-The reinforcement of its existing technical infrastructure as a result of increasing demand, a need to improve the quality of service, and the need to expand services to accommodate the growing population and geographical spread of the city;
-The need to improve the financial balance by which expenditures associated with effective service will be offset by sufficient revenues to make those enhanced services sustainable;
-The need to focus targeted actions on the reduction of poverty associated with the Millennium Development Goals.

ONAS (the agency responsible for managing urban sanitation and operating the public sewer network within the country) has proposed a rehabilitation of the wastewater collection network that serves an older portion of Dakar (Corniche West).  Currently, this wastewater is discharged into the ocean, with no treatment, about 200 yards from shore. In conjunction with rehabilitation of the collection pipes and evaluating the collection system, ONAS has plans for construction of a 10 to 20 million gallons per day treatment plant and a longer outfall pipe (the "Project"). This Feasibility Study would consider the technical and economic implications of both aspects of the Project.

<SUBJECT>B -- Obtain and Analyze Additional Data on Private Long-Term Care Claims Denials and Approvals
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-100-02-0014--0003
<RESPDATE>073007

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with LifePlans, Inc., Two University Office Park, Suite 304, 51 Sawyer Road, Waltham, MA 02154, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The purpose of this negotiation would be to modify an existing contract, 100-02-0014, in order to obtain and analyze additional data on private long-term care claims denials and approvals. The primary purpose of this contract modification is to conduct an in-depth empirical investigation of allegations that inappropriate claims denial practices are widespread within the private long-term care insurance (LTCI) industry or within certain companies that hold significant market share within the industry.  Concerns about claims payment practices in the private LTCI industry have been raised in the media and a Congressional committee has scheduled hearings and proposes to launch and investigation. The premise of this contract modification is that a scientifically credible determination as to whether inappropriate LTCI claims denials are common can be made most rapidly and cost-effectively accomplished by modifying and expanding the scope of work under the aforementioned existing Contract.  

The Government first contracted with Lifeplans to design a longitudinal study of an ?admission cohort? of private long-term care insurance claimants in 2001.  The baseline data was collected on a sample of nearly 1500 claimants from ten private insurance companies during 2003-2005.  Longitudinal follow-up (every four months) on surviving members of the admission cohort is still ongoing; however, all data has been collected and analyzed for the baseline ?in-person? interviews and subsequent follow-up interviews (by telephone every four months) through the fourth wave of follow-up interviews (16 months).  The ten private insurance companies whose policyholder/claimants have participated/continue to participate in the Lifeplans? LTCI Admission Cohort study collectively account for over 80 percent of all in-force private LTCI policies.  Thus, when properly weighted for corporate market share of in-force policies, the sample for this study is about as close as is possible to a nationally representative sample of private LTCI policyholders who have filed claims to access the benefits covered by their policies. 

The first published report from this study is available at http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2006/admcohort.htm.  The second report (16 month follow-up) will be published shortly. 

A major requirement of this acquisition is that the Contractor possesses considerable background in research on private long-term care insurance so that the study can be completed in time to provide information relevant to Government policymaking.  LifePlans, Inc. alone has both the research experience and pre-established relationships and track record of doing research with a significant majority of long-term care insurance companies that allows for specific and timely analyses to be performed.  LifePlans, Inc. is in receipt of grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in the amount of approximately one half the cost of this study.  Any other contractor would have to; 1) have existing relationships with long term care insurers, 2) have the data system capabilities for this nationwide study, 3) acquire specialized knowledge of the survey instruments, sample design and nurse assessment capability relating to private long-term care insurance, and, 4) be able to propose competitively with a firm that receives approximately half the cost of the study required in the Statement of Work via a grant.  Therefore, the Government believes that to award this Contract to any contractor but LifePlans would result in a significant increase in cost and even then would not assure adequate representation among participating insurance companies.?

The current contract modification proposes to have the Contractor obtain additional claims files from insurance companies.  It is anticipated that all ten of the companies involved in the study will agree to make additional claims data available.  Lifeplans will then analyze 500 claims approved and 500 claims denied during calendar year 2006.   Senior clinicians will review the claims files to determine the appropriateness of both claims denied and claims approved based on the requirements of the individual claimants policies.  It is anticipated that expanding the data collection with regard to claims approved/denied will be much more cost-effective and affordable as a modification to the current contract than as a new procurement.   Lifeplans has the experience and the expertise, in the form of the Caring Network of trained clinicians familiar with insurance claims adjudication processes to review the claims material provided.  Lifeplans also has developed relationships with participating insurers based on past research that will enable Lifeplans to access this very sensitive proprietary data.   Finally,  in view of the seriousness of the allegations with respect to widespread inappropriate LTCI claims denials, there is an urgent need to obtain the results of these claims analyses as quickly as possible and it is anticipated that Lifeplans will be able to complete these additional analyses within one year following award of the contract modification. Thus, the Government believes that to award this contract modification to any other contractor than Lifeplans would raise the cost of the additional data collection/analysis beyond the funds currently available to the Government for such research and would also fail to assure the continued participation of all of the currently participating major insurers in providing additional claims data for analysis.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government=s requirement as described above.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) has overall responsibility for the collection, storage, retrieval, dissemination, and destruction of OPIC records.  OPIC has program-specific applications and systems that support nearly 200 employees and 100 contractors with automated business processes.  OPIC requires an electronic records management system that supports an environment that generates, collects, stores, disseminates, retrieves and destroys information and records. 

The project involves replacing the Rdocs Software Applications used by the Records Management Office.  Currently two, non-integrated and out of date software applications are used for controlling the inventory, tracking, circulation and disposition of OPIC corporate paper records. Rdocs third party software is used to capture data identifying the files and their status. Rdocs stores information on the approximately 5000 paper records in an MS SQL database with a MS Access front-end.   

OPIC has selected the application of TOWER Software's TRIM Context 6 Enterprise Content Management for our solution. New government guidance requires that enterprise-wide electronic records management be implemented ASAP.

<DESC>VISN 6, Department of Veterans Affairs, will be releasing a solicitation for the purchase of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureous (MRSA) Analyzers for deployment to our Medical Centers located in Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia.  Anticipated date of release is on or about June 25, 2007.  Responses will be due on or about July 9, 2007.  Potential contractors must provide an FDA approved, fully-integrated and automated analysis instrument that uses a nucleic acid analysis for the rapid detection of MRSA from patient specimens. Acceptable solutions will allow flexibility for future expansion of testing, using the same instrumentation footprint to include, but not be limited to, Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, and Enterovirus.  Acceptable systems must be able to run individual samples without the need for batching and use unprepared samples with little or no preparation time (measured in minutes).  Acceptable systems should be able to conduct the test and give results rapidly (measured in hours including preparatory time).  There should be no requirement for a molecular trained technologist to operate the analyzer or to perform the test.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Please note, the time is updated comments due back to NAVAIR.  Questions, comments and other feedback are now required by Thursday, 21 June 2007.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the release of its updated DRAFT Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) solicitation with Sections L and M.  This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition. Contract award is anticipated in the second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008. This DRAFT SOLICITATION and its attached documents/exhibits will be listed at the website "Doing Business with NAVAIR", http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations and the Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) website, http://pma213.navair.navy.mil/systems/jpals.htm. JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that are more affordable, function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications. The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide. Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time. JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with our allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities. The JPALS capability will be incrementally acquired and incorporated into the DoD inventory of warfighting assets. Sea Based JPALS has been designated as Increment 1. The program is scheduled for a Milestone B decision in the 2nd Quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 with Sea Based JPALS (Increment 1) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) planned for FY14. The proposed system architecture will be driven by the requirements and constrained by the program schedule and affordability goals contained in the solicitation and in the JPALS Systems Requirements Document (SRD). Interested parties can view/download the Draft RFP N00019-07-R-0044) including its attachments: SOO, DD254, GFI List and GFI documents, and the Contract Data Requirements List (Data Items A001 through A115).  The SRD and the JPALS Security Classification Guide is available at the JPALS website or you may request a copy by contacting the PCO, Ms. Lynda Frattone at the email or telephone number referenced below. *Note: Current SRD revision (4) incorporates threshold requirements for Sea Based Increment 1. An update to SRD revision (4) now includes objective performance for availability in a jamming environment and auto land capability. This update is available at the JPALS website referenced above. Further, SRD revision (5), available in June 2007, will incorporate a Land-Based reference document for growth considerations. Exclusive of the above information posted on the NAVAIR website and the JPALS website, potential offerors must request a copy of the JPALS classified Annex A from the Government. Points of contact for the written request are below. The request must include the company name, classified mailing address, CAGE code, e-mail address, Facility Secuirty Officer name and telephone number, and point of contact with telephone number.

3	INTRODUCTION
The US Small Business Administration (SBA) relies on mainframe based legacy systems to support its mission of providing and servicing small business and disaster loans. These mainframe based legacy systems support the full life cycle (including financial management) of the following loan, loan guaranty and investment programs:
?	7(a)
?	504
?	Disaster (except loan origination)
?	Microloan
?	SBIC
The details about SBA and its loan programs can be found at http://www.sba.gov/.
These mainframe-based loan processing and accounting systems are inflexible and use obsolete technology. These stove piped systems are very expensive to maintain. These legacy systems don?t meet SBA?s current business needs and are very expensive to change to comply with current and future business needs. These systems are not compliant with accepted Federal security requirements, Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 and Financial System Integration Office?s (FSIO, also known as JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements, Direct Loan Systems Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements. These systems are inefficient, outdated and don?t take advantage of technological advances. They have been in place for approximately 50 years and significantly contribute to the amount of data reconciliation and manual processes required to do business. 
SBA has initiated a Loan Modernization effort to modernize its Loan Management and Loan Accounting Systems that will support loan origination, servicing, liquidation and financial management for its loan and loan guarantee programs. 
SBA?s vision is to adhere to the following guiding principles to implement modernized system(s):
?	Establish a standardized set of data elements across all loan programs.
?	Implement a single logical database with the clear separation of loan management data from the financial management data.
?	Implement electronic, real-time or near real-time, streamlined and simplified business processes.
?	Implement a single Integrated Financial Management System using COTS that complies with FSIO?s (JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements. 
?	Implement an Integrated Loan Management System using COTS that complies with FSIO?s (JFMIP) Direct Loan System Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements and Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.
?	Implement seamless integration between Loan Management and Financial Management processes.
?	Take advantage of technological advances in Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
?	Take advantage of processes and systems developed and implemented by other Federal Agencies. for example, Treasury?s Pay.Gov.
?	Implement a scalable, reliable, flexible, and highly available system using widely used technologies.
?	Implement appropriate internal controls to ensure the accuracy of data, completeness and consistency of transaction processing, and reporting in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Management?s Responsibility for Internal Controls.
?	Comply with E-Gov initiatives and use a Shared Service Provider (SSP) for implementation, hosting and application management to achieve economies of scale.
4	SCOPE OF THE LOAN MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
The scope of Loan Modernization program is to
?	Implement a single Integrated Loan Management System to support 7(a), 504, Microloan, Disaster and SBIC programs. The Loan Management system will support the full life cycle - Origination, Servicing and Liquidation - for these loan programs. The only exception is Disaster Loan Origination which is out side the scope of this program.
?	Implement single Integrated Financial Management System by leveraging the investment made in FSIO (formerly JFMIP) compliant Oracle Financials that supports Agency?s Administrative Accounting.
?	Comply with E-Gov initiative like FMLoB to achieve economies of scale by using public or private shared service provider for implementation, hosting and application management.
?	Comply with Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.
?	Comply with Debt Collection Act.
?	Comply with FSIO?s (formerly JFMIP) Direct Loan, Guarantee Loan and Core Financial System Requirements.
5	REQUIREMENTS
The vendor will provide the program management expertise to support SBA?s Loan Modernization Program:
1.	Establish the Program Management Office (PMO) 
2.	Implement proven templates, tools, processes and procedures recommended by Project Management Institute (PMI) and perfected by the vendor as part of their Program Management Center of Excellence.
3.	Assist in maintaining Business Case/Exhibit as per OMB Circular A-11, Part 7.
4.	Plan, manage, execute, monitor, control, and close the program.
5.	Initiate, plan, manage, monitor, control, and close each project initiated under the program.  
6.	Prepare and deliver briefings and other communication deliverables for the targeted stakeholders including senior leadership of SBA.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 13.104, SOURCES are SOUGHT for a medium-power Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser system.  The minimum technical requirements are as follows:

1.  Basic Configuration:  The 10.6 micron wavelength output of the *CO2 Laser* will be focused by an existing optical system to a small spot on a sample-in-vacuum on an existing optical table.  To facilitate alignment of the optical system, Vendor will provide an integrated *Pointer Laser* whose visible wavelength beam propagates co-axially with the main 10.6 micron beam.  The system will include any *Control Module* required to permit on/off pulse modulation (PM) of the otherwise continuous wave (CW) 10.6 micron output by TTL compatible signals from an existing TTL pulse generator.  The system will include any *External Housings* or *Electrical Shielding* required to prevent inadvertent contact by the User with any potentially dangerous electrical connections during routine operations.  The system will include any *RF Noise Containment* features required to comply with FCC Class A electromagnetic interference (EMI) regulations during operation in CW and PM modes; compliance with the stricter Class B standard is highly desirable.  The system will include any *Cooling Fan* required for air-cooled full power CW operation.  The system will include all *Power Supplies*, *Power Cables*, and *Control Cables* required for operation with 110 VAC single phase, 20 amp, 60 Hz electrical power.    

2.  Mechanical Dimensions:  Vendor will include a mechanical sketch of the entire system with correct external dimensions and proposed relative component placements in their proposal.  Space on the existing optical table is extremely limited, so the CO2 Laser and Power Supply must fit within a rectangular 12 inch x 30 inch footprint; smaller system footprints are highly desirable.  Proposals requiring vertical stacking of components by the User (using Government Furnice Equipment mounts) are acceptable, as long as the resulting height of the laser beam output port above the optical table does not exceed 12 inches.  

3.  System Performance:  Vendor will provide ?typical? test data from previously manufactured laser systems for all of the following technical requirements for the purpose of source selection.  In CW mode, the CO2 Laser will provide at least 20 Watts optical power at the nominal 10.6 micron output wavelength; higher optical power up to 30 Watts is desirable.  The spectral purity and optical polarization of the output beam are not important; multi-mode operation is anticipated to be most economical.  The 10.6 micron beam will have a circular transverse intensity profile, with a maximum permissible elliptical eccentricity (major/minor axes) of 1.3, and at least 90% of the beam energy at the output port contained within a 5 mm diameter; smaller output beam diameters are desirable.  The beam divergence must not exceed 10 milliradians; smaller beam divergences are desirable.  The system must permit pulse modulation at an arbitrary repetition rate determined by the TTL pulse generator.  The rise (0-to-90%) and fall (100-to-10%) times of the optical output will not exceed 150 microseconds.  The sum of the fixed delay and random jitter between the rising edge of the TTL control signal and the 10% rise time of the optical output will not exceed 100 microseconds.  

4.  Serviceability and Warranty:  Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, and the duration of the standard Warranty.  
    
Responses to this notice must be received within 5 days from date of this notice.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Firms responding to this notice should state whether they are, or are not, a small business concern, a service-disabled veteran owned small business, or a HUBZone business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 334513, small business size standard 500 employees.  The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  This requirement may be pursued sole source if the Air Force determines that only one source is capable of satisfying the requirement.

This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until 6/16/2008. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $10,000 to $10,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the !  topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Award of an effort under this BAA does not imply other than full and open competition in the future for follow-on acquisition(s) for the awarded task(s). Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. Additionally, theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation and/or proposed studies are specifically excluded. All criteria as outlined in FAR 35.016 are applicable. In order to minimize the cost related to proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties shall submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Interested parties may submit more than one white paper.  White Papers should clearly identify which concept area(s) they are responding to. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the prop!  osed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail. White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds). These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more imp!  ortant than price, but evaluated prices/costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers via e-mail to Renee Jung, renee.jung@navy.mil . Please refer to BAA number N00164-07-R-6423 in all correspondence and communications.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Contract to the University of Miami for Adaptive Statistical Design Analysis
<SOLNBR>NCND6000-7-13258
<RESPDATE>070507
<ARCHDATE>07102007
<CONTACT>Stephanie Garnett, Contract Specialist, Phone (808)944-2228, Fax (808)944-2141, Email stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of NOAA?s intent to negotiate a sole source contract with the Fisheries Ecosystem Modeling and Assessment Research (FEMAR) group at the University of Miami on behalf of the National Ocean Service (NOS), Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (Monument) office. This procurement is conducted in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), only one responsible source.   

The Monument office initiated a spatial data assessment in 2005 to evaluate its current monitoring program.  This requires advancements to existing observing and monitoring systems, and development of state-of-the-art analytical methodologies to deal with the large, spatially-synoptic data sets collected by NOAA and other partners.  To achieve this goal, the Monument must conduct ongoing assessments and evaluations of new proposed methodologies in fiscal year 2007.

This contract is a follow-on to the initial spatial data assessment that was conducted.  In order for the statistical analysis provided through this contract to be consistent with the previously provided data, the University of Miami must be contracted with to continue their research.  

In FY05, FEMAR scientists were contracted by WRAD through a purchase order to conduct an initial statistical assessment and analysis of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division?s (CRED) large ecosystem monitoring data sets (i.e., reef fish, coral reefs, algae, invertebrates, etc.) collected during a series of pilot surveys of the NWHI Coral Reef Reserve from the period 2000-2005.  Under the initial procurement the majority of the datasets required substantial revisions to make them complete as well as to match up relational fields such as station identification numbers.  The FY05 purchase order provided initial recommendations for rigorous statistical sampling for designated target organisms in the NWHI.  

 The initial procurement was conducted as a sole-source purchase order because of the University of Miami?s unique knowledge of coral reef ecosystems.  Previous published work in the Florida Keys on the coral reef ecosystems has established their credibility both nationally and internationally as experts in statistical analysis and assessment of coral reef data. Initial results of survey data collected in the Monument and analyzed by FEMAR scientists demonstrate that coral reefs in Florida have a great degree of similarity to reef ecosystems in Hawaii.  The initial procurement was issued for a base year only.  However, due to the scope of the project, several of the assessments have required modifications to the monitoring program and these proposed methodologies will require testing in the field. The new contract will involved testing the methodologies in the field and analysis of new data collected.  New assessments must conducted to be compatible with the previously data sets.  If another contractor were used to continue this effort, a significant amount of time would be lost, the data analysis already conducted would not be transferable and the opportunity to test these methods during this field season would not occur.

FEMAR has developed an unprecedented capability utilizing a systems science approach that stresses an applied scientific research strategy to support policy and management decision-making by federal, state, and local entities.  For the past decade, FEMAR, in collaboration with state and federal partners, has been conducting large-scale synoptic assessments of coral reef fisheries and benthic habitats in the Florida coral reef ecosystem to explore and characterize these unique marine environments.  FEMAR has conducted numerous single and multi-species coral reef fish stock assessments and has successfully applied ecosystem approaches to fisheries management in coral reef ecosystems.  FEMAR possesses unique expertise in multi-species fisheries and ecosystem-level investigations, population dynamics, sampling design, statistical analysis, simulation modeling, and geographic information systems.  In order to assure continuity and quality control of the new evaluations, a sole-source contract with FEMAR is the only way of doing so.

This contract will provide for continued sampling in FY07 through FY 2012 (if all options are exercised) to collect new monitoring data and allow for an adaptive synthesis and update of the statistics on which these designs were formulated.  The new data will be combined with the pilot data to refine the attributes and precision of the NWHI ecosystem monitoring design and data products relevant to management decision-making by Monument resource managers.  


The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately September 1, 2007.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 with a corresponding size standard of $6.5 million.  This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by July 5, 2007 may be considered by the Government.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating their capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Contract Specialist Stephanie Garnett at stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov. Please submit questions regarding this procurement to Stephanie at the above email address.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This Request for Information is for the purpose of conducting market research. 

This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information. There is no solicitation available at this time.

1.0 Purpose

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) is currently performing a market survey to identify vendors that can meet the requirements for a unified federated/enterprise search solution to include associate software and support services sources capable of providing Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) software products and supporting services described herein.

2.0 Background

The Judiciary is in the process of deploying a federated portal service which is built on JSR-168 and JSR-286 (Draft) standards and runs on a private network.  The private network contains over 400 autonomous web sites and enterprise applications, many of which have a native search solution.  The technology used to support the federated portal deployment is IBM Websphere Portal version 6.x on a Red Hat AS version 4.x Linux operating system with an IBM Tivoli Directory Service configured to LDAP version 3 standards.  This directory service is used to support federated user authentication and data access authorization requirements. 

The federated portal will provide federated search services to both java-based and Microsoft SharePoint 2007 niche portals registered in the federated community.
 
The short term vision for the portal's search service is to provide both a federated search experience for the entire federated portal community as well as be deployable into an application for indexed search support.  

The long term vision extends federated search support to internal court websites lacking an internal portal infrastructure. 
 
It should be noted that the Judiciary does not manage classified materials, however the Judiciary does manage sensitive information which requires special handling to comply with user accessibility and information privacy parameters.
 
3.0   General Description:

A unified federated/enterprise search solution which includes software and support services. 

The requirement is for a search capability that can look for information among many systems based upon a single user query.  The results of this query should support ranking based upon relevancy criteria, support follow-on query within a search results return, use two or more methods to identify the information source.  The solution needs to provide a scalable, phased approach for managing content additions, use an automated method for the identification of data to the search mechanism, provide a quick method for deleting content that should not have been included in a search.  The search solution also needs to identify duplicate content, include an option to decentralize content administration, and support user group information access authorization constraints if applicable.  The solution sought includes services to implement and manage the search service.  The managed responsibilities include a daily process for reviewing logs and updating the relevancy rules daily based upon user history.  System administration will need to support continuous availability as long as a user has access to the enterprise portal.  The search infrastructure is designed to support scheduled maintenance on hardware in a manner that does not disrupt availability of search service through portal to the end user.


        3.1 High Level Requirements

      i)    Shall integrate content in a manner that performs simultaneous searches throughout diverse sources such as internal documents, various intranet sites, selected syndicated news feeds and selected internet sites. 

i)	Shall support two-factor authentication without any additional middleware. 

j)	Shall be compatible with IBM Tivoli Directory Services, LDAP, eDirectory and Active Directory.

k)	Shall be compatible with Lotus Notes version 6.5 or higher. 

l)	Shall be delivered with out-of-the-box API connectors for the following databases: Informix, Oracle, DB2, MySQL, Microsoft SharePoint portals, Microsoft SQL, and EMC Documentum.

m)	Shall provide a single query return to the end user that automatically combines indexed and federated results to include the organization?s licensed content from external information providers such as Lexis-Nexis.

n)	Shall provide a graphical user interface to support remote web-based system administration, specialized functionality development to modify the COTS product, and to support change management.

o)	Shall support various relationships to include one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many between result documents and the original document source.

p)	Shall be capable of providing search of text for a query specified word or group of words that are in the file formats listed in the following sentence.

Background:

Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by the Federal and State governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America?s poorest people.  

Within broad national guidelines established by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and administers its own program.  State participation in Medicaid is voluntary; however, all States have chosen to participate.  The federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, Section 6034, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  The MIP offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent inappropriate Medicaid payments.  It will also support the efforts of State Medicaid agencies through a combination of oversight and technical assistance.  Objectives of the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) include: 

?	Review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for fraud, waste or abuse;
?	Audit of paid claims for items or services furnished, or administrative services rendered;
?	Identification of overpayments to individuals or entities receiving Federal funds under this title; and,
?	Education of providers of services, managed care entities, beneficiaries, and other individuals with respect to payment integrity and quality of care.


Type of Procurement:

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates issuance of multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts under a forthcoming solicitation in the beginning of January 2007.  However, CMS reserves the right to use any other procurement instrument as deemed appropriate at the time of the official solicitation.  It is anticipated the IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded as a base plus four (4) one-year options for a total not-to-exceed effort of 5 years.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE:  This notice is issued for informational and planning purposes.  The Air Force will not pay for any information submitted or be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice.

The Air Force is conducting market research for US TRANSCOM Property, Plant and Equipment Data Cleansing for the  Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System to be performed at Scott AFB, IL and desires inut from industry to assist in requirements planning.  The information requested by this notice will be used within the Air Force to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.  The following  are basic performance requirements for the requirement:

The contractor shall develop and maintain a Property Plant and Equipment subsidiary to the general ledger and must be able to serve the needs of different community users.  The subsidiary ledger records the acquisition cost of the property and/or net book value/fair market value for donated or transfer items.  For capitalized property, the subsidiary ledger records the acquisition costs, net book value or fair market value of donated or transferred assets, the property's useful life, salvage value, and appropriate depreciation/ amortization method.  In addition to the initial value, it also records capital improvements.  

Data cleansing.  The contractor shall provide data validation and data cleansing efforts.  The contractor shall identify data entities in the legacy system of record that should be cleaned before conversion takes place.  This involves the reduction of redundant and erroneous records before the data is transferred.  Documentation (original documents and/or hard and electronic copies of original documentation) shall be maintained in a readily available location, during the applicable retention period, to permit the validation of information pertaining to the asset such as the purchase cost, purchase date, and cost of improvements.  Property records will be kept current and shall provide a complete trail of all transactions, suitable for audit, i.e., a transaction-based history of asset activity. A number of cleaning iterations may be required in order to significantly increase the quality of source data prior to conversion.

Data Transformation.  The contractor shall assist in evaluating options with the DEAMS System Integrator (SI) plans and procedures for data transformation.  Data transformation involves any change in format, structure, or data elements based on business rules provided by the Government.  This includes the enrichment of data by addition of any data or attributes that are not available in the subsidiary ledger but which are required for Oracle 11i.  The reference tables to add this data will need to be provided along with the associated business rules.   The contractor shall assist in the mapping of the source data into the target format necessary for acceptance by DEAMS. This would also include transforming data from a subsidiary ledger value to a new value that will be used in the DEAMS implementation of Oracle 11i.  For example, the transformation from legacy to Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) line of accounting.  

Conversion. The contractor shall assist in evaluation options with the DEAMS System Integrator (SI) plans and procedures for data conversion of the subsidiary.  The objective of the conversion effort is to populate the new Oracle 11i Project Accounting and Asset modules with all the data required to support the business processes and functionality of the particular release.  The conversion will be executed in such a manner that converted data is accurate/complete and the system implementation timeframe is met. The contractor shall assist in evaluating the steps for data conversion execution. The subsidiary ledger is required before the test period and implementation of DEAMS.  Once the data is loaded into Oracle 11i, it will be reconciled with the data in the legacy systems to ensure that the converted data is accurate and complete.  Any problems or errors that are identified will be resolved.

Business Process Reengineering (BPR).  The contractor shall assist in evaluating the business process reengineering of PP&E business processes around the DEAMS solution.  This shall include participation in Integrated Process Teams (IPT)?s and other activities and make recommendations relating to process improvement alternatives that are available through BPR and the use of the DEAMS Oracle product.  The contractor shall assist in the review and evaluation of technical documents, strategies, and approaches related to the implementation of DEAMS.  The contractor shall provide analysis and support related with the "as is" process and the "to be" process in technical configuration, technical environmental considerations, and performance projections related to various technical alternatives available through the implementation of the DEAMS Oracle solution. 

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541219.  Small business size is $6M.  A draft performance work statement will be posted as an attachment to this notice.

Information requested:
1. Company information: Name, address, telephone number, FAX number, point of contacts names, phone number, and e-mail.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to maintain and further develop a repository for the receipt and distribution of blood samples, DNA, cell lines, and associated phenotypic and genotypic data.  The NINDS is seeking Small Business Capability Statements at this time in order to determine if this future requirement can be set-aside exclusively for small business concerns.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, and if your business concern is NOT a small business, there is no need to respond to this announcement.  Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future requirement for a small business set-aside (or an open competition to include both large and small businesses), a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement would be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals.    

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 or fewer employees.  Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside (where large businesses would be excluded from competing), at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be ?in-house?.  Specifically, FAR 52.219-14, ?Limitations on Subcontracting,? states that ?at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.?  Submitted Capability Statements must address how the business meets the applicable size standard.          

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has the stated mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease?a burden borne by every age group, by every segment of society, by people all over the world.  Within this mission falls gene discovery. Gene discovery elucidates the cause of some diseases, and also, the underlying pathogenesis of related disorders. Therefore, this contract re-competition, which will build an infrastructure to support and encourage gene discovery, serves the mission of NINDS.  Such studies require a large and diverse sample and accompanying information base. Thus, a repository of DNA samples, immortalized cell lines (from which DNA can be extracted continuously), and accompanying clinical and pedigree data is clearly an invaluable resource for the neuroscience community.  The NINDS repository, established in 2002, receives, stores, and distributes DNA, Cell lines, and accompanying clinical and genotypic data to the Neuroscience community.  It will ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decrease duplicative sampling efforts.  It allows collection of a sample set that is large enough to discover common genetic risk factors for neurological disorders.  It will also ensure that a standardized, useful dataset of demographic, other phenotypic, and genotypic data is managed and curated to allow sharing publicly via NLM?s DbGaP.

The objective of this requirement is to continue the growth of the sample numbers and types, the data complexity, the administrative role and the data management capabilities of the NINDS DNA sample and cell line repository for human gene discovery.   

To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability and related experience in a requirement-specific Capability Statement to:  1) Receive, process, store, and distribute Whole blood, and buccal swabs from individuals with neurological disorders as well as from healthy individuals into cell lines and DNA; 2) Manage and track administrative study documents,  phenotypic and genotypic data; 3) monitor human subject concerns compliance with federal and other human subject regulations, to include a means of masking individual identities to ensure confidentiality; 4) Maintain flexibility in order to expand as needed to accomplish aims of related or overlapping projects; 5) Provide rapidly, upon request, as well as routinely, cell lines and DNA samples to submitters and sample withdrawers as well as associated data using a fee based system to offset costs; 6) transfer the existing NINDS repository of DNA and cell lines as well as data to their organization to allow seamless functioning of the existing project; 7) have the capacity to store, distribute, and process the current collection of over 16 thousand samples plus an additional 10 thousand biological samples and associated complex phenotypic data; 8) to develop, a website as well as transfer the existing web-based system and maintain and modify it based on needs of the resource and 9) develop, transfer, and maintain a database of all associated data and resources needed to manage the data and user interface for the project.  

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit 3 copies of your written Capability Statement to the attention of Jason Williams, Contracting Officer at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Friday, June 29, 2007.  Capability Statements should be limited to no more than 15 pages and should specifically address each of the competencies stated above.  A generic marketing brochure would not suffice for purposes of determining a small business to be capable for this requirement.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only and a future Pre-Solicitation Notice for this requirement would indicate this determination.  This Small Business Sources Sought Announcement is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government?s use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought announcement or the Government?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Responses will be held in a confidential manner.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  

Please submit 3 copies of your Capability Statement to:
Jason Williams, Contracting Officer, National Institutes of Health, NINDS Contracts Management Branch, 6001 Executive Blvd., Suite 3287, Rockville, MD  20852.
Electronic submittal will also be accepted at willjas@mail.nih.gov (please format for printing).

1) AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:   USDA/ARS/MWA, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL Location, Photosynthesis Research Facility.  2) DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:   A Service Contract is needed for a highly sophisticated piece of existing equipment with proprietary software provided by Thermo Electron North America, LLC.  Considerable savings to the Government can be realized by entering into an agreement for these services. 3) DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:   Labor, parts and loan of alternate equipment in case of lengthy service requirements for the existing equipment. 4) AUTHORITY CITED:   FAR Part 6.302-1 (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. 5) REASONS FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  Service of this sophisticated instrument would be costly to the government if sought from outside sources due to the software being proprietary and the necessity to find parts and labor to complete necessary repairs.  Alternative equipment would need to be sought resulting in a great expense if the repairs required lengthy down time.6) EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  A substantial duplication of cost to the Agency in time and effort would be made if competition were sought. 7) FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION:  Costs of labor and parts for repairs to the existing equipment would be prohibitive without a Maintenance Agreement.8) MARKET RESEARCH:    Thermo Electron North America, LLC is the only reliable source proven to be capable to provide the expert repairs for this equipment.  9) OTHER SUPPORTING FACTORS:  See Attachment Exhibit C  10) INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A11) ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: N/A 12) TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief: Name Plant Physiologist    Purchasing Agent Certification:

This instrument is a highly sophisticated with proprietary software.  2) Clear and complete discussion of reasons why competitive quotations are not practical. Contract is for existing equipment.  The original vendor must be used in order to provide service, labor, parts and loan of alternate equipment in case of lengthy service requirements.  Searching for an alternative vendor would not be cost effective to the Government. 3) Sufficient explanation to allow a person without technical competence in the area to follow the rationale:   Alternate vendors would not have the technical expertise required to repair and maintain this instrument.  Costly delays to the research being conducted could result from a lack of a viable service contract.
B 4)  Facilities or specialized equipment:  Labor, parts and preventive maintenance including one preventive maintenance visit and unlimited emergency on-site visits for problem resolution.  The plan also includes consumables as specified as well as 2 hour technical support response time, automatic case logging, software updates and access to available online support resources. 5) Availability of technical data and other information, including drawings and specifications:  See Support Plan Quotation No. 20051008.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Notice of Intent to Sole Source - Intensive Supervision Appearance Program Case Management with Electronic Monitoring Devices
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source

Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (DHS/ICE)

Intensive Supervision Appearance Program Case Management with Electronic Monitoring Devices    

The U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) intends to award a sole source ceiling price (firm-fixed price per day per participant) task order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302 to BI Incorporated, with one one-year option.  The estimated value of this procurement is approximately $16,060,000.00 per year.  The base period of performance is July 1, 2007 through June 20, 2008.  

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Detention and Removal Operations, Alternatives to Detention Unit issues this Notice of intent to sole source regarding Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) case management services, which shall include electronic monitoring device installation and management, for supervision of non-United States citizens released from ICE custody into the community, who reside within a managed service area.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the ICE?s requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which will be considered only if received by 5:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Thursday, June 28, 2007.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Patryk Drozd by email, Patryk.drozd@dhs.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All questions should be directed to Patryk Drozd via e-mail at Patryk.drozd@dhs.gov on or before 5:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Friday, June 22, 2007.  

Background

DHS/ICE is the primary agency responsible for managing the administrative process to determine if non-US citizens may enter or remain in the United States, commonly known as removal proceedings.  ICE currently has approximately 30,000 aliens in custody each day.  The majority of bed space is currently used for mandatory detention cases and the need to manage the remaining bed space is critical.  
The Alternatives to Detention Unit within ICE supervises aliens who are not detained in DHS custody.  Congress has specifically earmarked funding for ATD programs as one way of addressing the multitude of issues associated with illegal immigration and detention space issues.  To improve ATD functions, the ATD unit must implement established contractor case management tasks to focus on the ISAP Program intake and orientation, a risk/needs assessment, and an ISAP case management and service plan.  This service plan is to include a legal, translation, community resources, and transportation plan to assist the alien in preparing for eventual removal from the United States.  In addition, the case management plan will consist of face-to-face contact at the contractor-provided facility, weekly verification schedule, electronic monitoring (EM) supervision, unscheduled home visits, employment verification (as allowed under US immigration law), and identification of guarantors known to the ISAP Participant.
The ISAP services are separated into three (3) phases: Intense, Intermediate, and Regular.  These phases control the frequency at which the services are administered and the type of EM the Participant shall be placed on, and the length of monitoring.  The DHS/ICE Alternatives to Detention Unit is currently exploring ISAP services and supervision technologies that can encompass ICE requirements, yet remain flexible in the selection and frequency of those services.  Services shall include monitoring and reporting program compliance, including positive and negative program termination, absconder rates, appearance at immigration hearings, and length of time in program modules and provide a cost effective solution versus secure detention to provide progressive supervision for aliens who are released from ICE custody to the community.  The supervision technologies are to include, but are not limited to, non-removable bracelets using radio frequency (RF) or GPS (active and passive) that operate either over landline or cellular technology, and multi-lingual telephonic reporting.

The contractor will be providing the following services: 

a.	Provide the full range of ISAP services through offices established in proximity to the three (3)  DHS  offices listed in Attachment 1.  The ISAP services consist of:
i.	Case management
ii.	Supervision
iii.	Electronic Monitoring
iv.	Coordination with ICE Officers in obtaining travel documents

b.	Provide latest generation electronic monitoring equipment as follows:
i.	Non-removable radio frequency (RF) or GPS bracelet for wrist or ankle operating on landline or cellular mode
ii.	Telephonic reporting through voice recognition
iii.	Industry innovations in participant personal reporting, tracking and residence presence/absence verification
iv.	See Attachment 2 for detailed EM equipment specifications

c.	Provide a 24/7 monitoring center capable of nationwide event tracking, automated event notification and staff available by telephone/fax 24 hours a day.

d.  ICE requirements:
i.	Routine face to face reporting at contractor-provided facility is necessary to reduce burden on ICE Field Offices nationwide
ii.	Contractor-performed residence verification and unannounced home visits are a core requirement for ICE
iii.	Electronic monitoring of participants may be used by ICE to increase compliance throughout the removal process.  Electronic monitoring may be needed for hundreds to thousands of participants nationwide at any given time to support the overall ICE law enforcement mission
iv.	Contractors performing such close supervision of participants will provide a much needed resource for ICE?s efforts to obtain participant travel documents

e.  ICE requirements for Intensive Supervision Case Specialists (herein known as ?Case Specialists?) and Participant Administrators:
i.	Participant Administrators who can process a participant?s intake, routine supervision documentation and termination from the program
ii.	Case Specialists who will approve supervision plans, complete program orientation, conduct in-person office visits, residence verification, and unannounced home visits.  In addition, Case Specialists will be the primary person responsible for supervising participants in the program  
iii.	Program Manager who will be responsible for all Case Specialist activities, office efforts in supervising participants, communicating with the ICE staff/management and the office?s resulting levels of compliance with the program and the ICE removal process



f.  ICE requirements on supervision capacity:
i.	ICE may have a need to intake 2200-2500 participates immediately upon commencement of this program
ii.	Participants will be supervised as directed by ICE on any or all electronic monitoring available under the program at any time
iii.	ICE will generate any task order for this program with a ?no minimum/no maximum? clause.  However, when responding to this RFI, information must be provided on the maximum available amount of electronic monitoring equipment, contractor-owned office and staff resources available (including those with approved DHS suitability determinations) to be dedicated to this program.  ICE has a goal of supervising ten percent of non-detained aliens.  The current number of non-detained aliens in these proceedings is approximately 1.65 million

g.  Contractor-owned and established case management system (s) that are may be accessed by Internet portals.  These case management systems must include:
i. 	Participant information 
ii.	Supervision events and history 
iii.	ISAP Emergency Reports
iv.	Data/reporting functions 
v.	Information on complying with DHS security requirements.  
vi.	See Attachment 3

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT) has installed Knoll modular furniture in all MARCENT facilities.  The Knoll modular furniture design?s stability and system integrity hinges on the attachment of properly fitted cubicle systems.  In addition, the MARCENT Knoll cubicle system was designed and set-up to maximize the available space within MARCENT.  To conjoin another cubicle system would seriously degrade the entire system and would not allow for the maximum use of available space.  The other option would be to purchase an entire cubicle system which is currently valued at $439K.  Pursuing another cubicle system would not be cost effective nor would it be reasonable when additional Knoll cubicle systems can be purchased for $32K.

<SUBJECT>D -- Sole Source Contract to CLS America for Satellite Data Processing
<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of NOAA?s intent to negotiate a sole source contract with CLS America on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). 

The Western Region Acquisition Division proposes to negotiate a sole-source contract with CLS America (formerly Service Argos, Inc.) for data telemetry and geolocation services.  The proposed contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  The proposed contract will be for one year from the date of contract award and will contain options for up to four additional one year periods.  

Over the past decade, PIFSC has deployed numerous base Argos transmitters, specifically manufactured for use with the Argos data and geolocation package, which is flown on NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). CLS America (Formerly known as Service Argos Inc.)  is the only vendor who can provide data telemetry and geolocation services for these proprietary transmitters.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by Part 6.302-1 of the FAR, full and open competition is not required when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Because Fisheries has installed Argos transmitters through previous contract actions, CLS is the only vendor who can provide data telemetry and geolocation services for these proprietary transmitters.

Argos is a satellite-based data collection and geo-location system dedicated to monitoring and protecting the environment. Any mobile platform carrying an Argos transmitter can be located anywhere in the world, and data from sensors connected to the transmitter can be collected, processed and distributed anywhere in the world. Location information is derived through Doppler or GPS. PIFSC has Argos transmitters deployed on fixed data buoys, drifting buoys, profiling floats, turtles, marine mammals, and other in situ tags. Among other things, these platforms provide valuable measurements of meteorological and oceanographic conditions and ecological systems.

As a NOAA entity, PIFSC has access to a preferential fee structure for using the Argos system. The fee structure was negotiated under the Argos Joint Tariff Agreement (JTA).

The Argos system has been operational since 1978 and was established under an agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the French Space Agency (CNES). Japan and Europe have joined this international system with a decision to fly Argos on their satellites. Argos is operated by CNES subsidiary Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS) which is based in Toulouse, France. CLS has a U.S. subsidiary, CLS America, Inc., whose main office is located near Washington, D.C. CLS America, Inc., is the entity that U.S. users interact with regarding Argos service.

The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately August 1, 2007.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 517410 with a corresponding size standard of $13.5 million.  This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by July 5, 2007 may be considered by the Government.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating their capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Contract Specialist Stephanie Garnett at stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov.

monthly Ultrasounds and Mammo studies, or is the doc just acting as the lead for these
modalities and will read all other films as well?    

A1.  This contract for Radiology Services is for Mammography and Ultrasound films only.
   
Q2.  Would the Air Force accept having the doc work at the MTF on a FT basis as opposed to having an off-site office and reading the films at that location?
 
A2.  With the exception of Mammography and Ultrasound, we currently send all Radiographic films to Colorado to be read by the AF Academy Radiologist.   
   
Q3.  Are you looking for a bid based on a daily rate, not a per study rate and with the 
LIP costs figured in?
  
A3.  We assume LIP costs are Lead Interpreting Radiologist costs and, if so, yes they need to be included. This LIP is for the mammo program and is a necessity for the program to be run correctly.  Additionally this Radiologist needs to be a Medical Audit Lead Radiologist. This could be the same person or be on the team that reads the films.

Q4.  This is also a bid for analog mammography and analog US, not FFDM or teleradiology correct?

A4.  Correct

<SUBJECT>R -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - MARKET RESEARCH, Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System (PASS) Services
<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil), is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President?s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) activities throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, and Guam.  PASS functions performed Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) are also being examined for possible transfer to CONUS for execution.

This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the PASS activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  The present scope and grouping of these activities, which are subject to change as the preliminary planning process progresses, include:  Fiscal Accountability, Administration, Passenger Transportation Support Services, Pay and Personnel Support, Training, and Customer Service.  Presently excluded from the scope are inherently governmental activities such as passport agent, disbursing officer, and transportation officer responsibilities.  OPNAVINST 4650.15, Passenger Transportation Manual and Draft OPNAVINST 1000.23C, PASS Manual are provided with this announcement to provide additional insight into the PASS activities.

The aforementioned scope includes the Navy Regions, Installations, and Military, Civilian, and Contractor billets identified in Attachment 1, Funded Military and Civilian Authorizations by PSA and PSD/CSD.  With respect to the billet counts set forth in Attachment 1, note that they represent a rough order of magnitude and are subject to change as the preliminary planning process continues.  General information regarding the Personnel Support Activities (PSA), Personnel Support Detachments (PSD), and Customer Service Desks (CSD) set forth in Attachment 1 is available at www.psasd.navy.mil.  Note, however, that the PASS Program is currently undergoing a reorganization that includes the Apr 07 establishment of the Navy Pay and Personnel Support Center (NPPSC) responsible for providing management, oversight and training to PSDs, the Apr 07 disestablishment of PSA Atlantic and its reestablishment as PSA West Detachment under PSA West providing for the consolidation of CONUS activities, and the eventual realignment of PSA Pacific and PSA Europe under NPPSC scheduled for Oct 07.

Interested parties are requested to complete and return via email the Attachment 2, CNIC Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) Market Research Questionnaire and associated Attachment 2A, CNIC Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) Scope and Grouping and Attachment 2B, CNIC Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) Past Performance History no later than 4:00 PM Eastern, 6 Jul 07.  E-mail responses should be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Candice Borden, at candice.borden@navy.mil.  If you have questions concerning this RFI, please contact Ms. Borden at 843-820-5945.  Your participation in this market research endeavor is greatly appreciated and will be instrumental in assisting CNIC in making the right competitive sourcing decision.

The unit must have the ability to train and rehearse virtually in any environment worldwide.  The system must provide a three dimensional, software based terrain tool to include systems, software, connectivity, and appropriate operator training and maintenance agreement.  This software will eliminate the expenses and need to replace existing SIM cards, saving the government thousands of dollars.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 22 June 2007, 10:00 A.M. Pacific Standard Time.  Quotations received after that date and time will not be considered.  Electronic offers submitted via FAX to 510-637-5978 Attn: Roy Gilbert or by email to Roy.L.Gilbert@uscg.mil are acceptable and strongly encouraged.

c. Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in the solicitation.

d. Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and

e. Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids).   
The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Scope:

The USU Anatomical Gift Program allows civilians the opportunity to donate their body to USU for teaching and research purposes.  When a call is received informing the University that someone who is a designated donor has passed away, the contractor must ascertain the name, address and telephone number of the deceased and have the body transported from the place where death occurs, or where remains are located, to USU.  Once teaching/research has been completed, the remains will need to be transported to the crematory for cremation, and returned to USU for final disposition.  Cremated remains must be incased in a polyethylene urn.

Death Call services include receiving after hour calls notifying USU of a donor?s death, obtainment of vital statistics and other relevant information (i.e. condition of the body, donor?s next of kin, certificate of death (COD)).  The contractor shall contact USU on the next duty day informing them of the death call donor.  USU will provide the Death Call phone number and the contractor will maintain that number until the contract expires.    

All removals (Anatomical Gift Program/Death Call) must be accompanied with appropriate documentation ? death certificate, burial-transit permit, and other approvals as required (i.e., medical examiner?s stamp).

All transfers from the MSAB must be accompanied with appropriate documentation (i.e., release).

Background

For the past eight years, DIO has utilized a physician/scientist to act as its medical expert. Approximately one third of the accessions, inquiries and investigations that are reviewed by DIO involve some aspect of clinical medicine, and the physician/investigator, who will serve as a consultant, is expected to provide advice and assistance to other DIO staff as needed and to provide oversight review on a substantial portfolio of cases.  This requires a wide variety of skills including but not limited to reviewing the institution reports sent to DIO for completeness, asking institutions for additional evidence or analyses as needed, and preparing written reports summarizing the DIO oversight review.  These reports must be written so that the language and logic of the medical/scientific findings is clear to both other scientists and to ORI=s attorneys, who must use these reports to prepare voluntary agreements and/or charge letters to attempt to persuade respondents and their attorneys of the merits of ORI=s arguments and findings.

Contractor qualifications

The contractor must have an M.D. degree and a license to practice medicine.  A Ph.D. in the physical sciences and substantial experience directing and conducting a research program is highly desirable.  Preference will be given to contractors with experience in peer review of grant applications and manuscripts submitted to journals, and extensive publications that demonstrate writing ability and being able to communicate well with non-scientists.

TASKS:

1. 	Provide expertise in describing for ORI the nature of the diseases and normal medical condition, the types of records that should exist, and an analysis of discrepancies in these records, from a viewpoint that recognizes their medical and scientific significance. 

In performing this role, the contractor will write draft and final investigational summary reports for clinical cases involving proposed ORI findings of research misconduct and provide advice for the ORI and the Office of General Counsel on such cases under negotiation for voluntary agreements.  The contractor will also provide oversight review of  clinical cases and accessions that do not lead to ORI findings of research misconduct.  The contractor will also attend and participate in weekly meetings of the ORI Case Evaluation Council, providing comments based on the contractor=s expertise in other pending ORI cases.

2.	Contractor will also provide expert advice in oversight review of accessions,  inquiries and investigations requiring expertise in human and vertebrate physiology, bioengineering, and statistics. 

 
3.	Contractor will conduct historical analyses of ORI=s clinical cases and provide summaries of trends in how the inappropriate behavior of respondents in clinical cases (doctors, nurses, CRAs, etc.) changes over time.

4.	Contractor shall prepare and give presentations for ORI sponsored meetings and other national and international meetings with a focus on human medicine as required, and prepare  manuscripts for publication on clinical topics as they relate to research misconduct and scientific ethics.

The period of performance is not to exceed 1 year (12 months) with an estimated level of 1,000 hours.


Deliverables

1)	written proposals for voluntary agreements, with analysis of the clinical significance, for proposed ORI findings of research misconduct in clinical cases (at least 5), and written investigational summary reports or closeout memoranda on specific cases or accessions involving clinical research that do not lead to ORI findings of research misconduct (at least 2).  Attendance and participation at the weekly ORI Case Evaluation Council meetings will be recorded.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received. 

Q1. Is there any specific requirement for proposal response format?

A1. NO.

Q2. What are the required staffing levels? Is it ad hoc or more full-time work?

A2. THERE ARE NO REQUIRED STAFFING LEVELS.  IT WILL BE AD HOC.

Q3. Is there an incumbent contractor or a contractor already producing promotional materials, exhibits, Newsline, and the other products mentioned in the solicitation for NLM? If so, what is the name of that contractor and what is the approximate dollar value of the contract? 

A3. THERE IS NOT AN INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR ALREADY PRODUCING ALL OF THE PRODUCTS MENTIONED IN THE SOLICITATION.

Q4.  The solicitation mentions that cost is one of the evaluation factors. However, there is no information regarding what kind of cost information bidders should provide. With that in mind, what cost information should bidders provide, and how will NLM evaluate cost? If you can provide us with more information about how many different products and their lengths NLM will need designed and produced, we can develop a budget for the entire contract. For example, how many different posters and CD labels will be required under Task 1, and what are the other print materials under that task (type, length, etc.)? We realize it may not be possible for NLM to estimate the quantities at this time, but bidders could base their costs on uniform assumptions that NLM provides. Or as an alternative, we can provide hourly rates for particular types of work (e.g., design, production, proofreading, etc.). 


A4. WE WOULD LIKE COST INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF HOURLY RATES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS (E.G. DESIGN, PRODUCTION, CONSULTING, PROOFREADING).

Q5. Are foreign-language translation services for promotional materials for MedlinePlus en Espa?ol and/or for other NLM products required under this contract? 

A5. NO


Q6. Please clarify the format and submission requirements for the cost proposal. 

A6. NO SPECIFIC FORMAT IS REQUIRED.

Q7. For the resume required under the Personal Merit technical evaluation criteria, should this be the Project Manager resume?  

A7. THE PROJECT MANAGER AND/OR DESIGN TEAM SHOULD SUBMIT A RESUME.(S).

Q8. Under the Personal Merit technical evaluation criteria, would the Government accept a detailed professional/education summary and references instead of a resume?  

A8. YES.  A PROFESSIONAL/EDUCATION SUMMARY AND REFERENCES WOULD BE FINE.

Q9. Do you have additional information pertaining to the exhibitions (i.e., locations, timeframes, size of rented space) I ask because the pricing ranges widely for exhibition displays from low to very high, depending on many factors.

A9. WE ARE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF EXPERIENCE IN EXHIBIT PRODUCTION AND DESIGN.  COST INFORMATION SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF HOURLY RATES AS MENTIONED ABOVE.

Q10. Is there any specific guidelines or formats to follow when submitting an electronic response to this solicitation?  Would pdf file suffice?  

A10. NO.

Q11. The solicitation indicates that "cost/price" will be an evaluation factor but there is no specific project description that describes a level of effort and project specifications that can be priced. Will you do your evaluation based on GSA labor prices under the AIMS Schedule 541-4F for Commercial Art and Graphic Design Services (Small Business Set-Aside)?

A11. AGAIN, WE WOULD LIKE COST INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF HOURLY RAES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS AS MENTIONED ABOVE.


Q12. Under the Technical evaluation criteria, it says "A writing sample (not to exceed 500 words) to be included." Should this sample be text from a project we designed and provided content development services? Or is this a limitation on the proposal text?

A12. THIS SHOULD BE TEXT FROM A PROJECT YOU DESIGNED AND PROVIDED CONTENT DEVELOPMENT.

Q13. Is there a limit to the number of pages in the proposal?

A13. NO LIMIT, HOWEVER IF OVER 10 PAGES PLEASE MAIL.

Q14. Is there a file size limit to the PDF submission that will be sent by email?

A14. NO LIMIT.  BUT YOU MIGHT SEND IN PARTS IF SIZE IS QUESTIONABLE.

Q15. Is a cost proposal required, or is the totality of a response to focus on existing capabilities and past performance qualifications?  If a cost proposal is required ? other than costs associated with our proposed labor, are we required to cost out the actual production of designed products (without knowling exactly what the products are and the quantity to be produced, this cannot be done)? 

A15. RESPONSE SHOULD FOCUS ON CAPABILITIES, PAST PERFORMANCE AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOURLY RATES MENTIONED EARLIER.

Q16. Are you, in essence, really only looking for one person to do all 4 tasks (you only ask for one resume)? 

A16. IF MORE THAN ONE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, CONSULTING SERVICES, ETC, THEN RESUMES FOR OTHER KEY PERSONNEL WOULD BE REQUIRED.

Q17. Please clarify the requirement for a writing sample under the Technical Merit evaluation criteria. 

A17. A WRITING SAMPLE COULD INCLUDE A BROCHURE, OR ANOTHER PROMOTIONAL PIECE, DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED FOR A CLIENT.
 
Q18. Is there any sort of media relations or third party outreach involved with the contract?

A18. NO.

Q19.  Is the contracted organization responsible for promotions?

A19. NO.

Q20.  Does the contracted organization have to figure out the target audience of the ads, and perform other basic PR functions for the campaign?

A20. NO.  TARGET AUDIENCES ARE DETERMINED BY NLM?S OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS.

Q21. Does this include the development and design of Websites, if so, how many? 

A21. POTENTIALLY IT COULD INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN OF WEBSITES. 

Q22. Task 1 refers to other print materials, do you have an estimate on the number of other items? 

A22. NO.  OTHER PRINT MATERIALS ON AN AD HOC BASIS.

Q23. Task 3 refers to the Quarterly Magazine, will there be a new design every quarter or will the contractor design a template to be used throughout the year? 

A23. LIKE A NEWSPAPER, THE LAYOUT WILL BE EXPECTED TO CHANGE  WITH EACH ISSUE ? BUT A TEMPLATE WOULD BE ANTICIPATED AS WELL.

Q24. Task 4 is for the design of promotion materials.  Is this the design of custom promotional materials or just the design of art work?  Do you have an estimate of the number of items to be designed?

A24. THIS REFERS TO THE DESIGN OF PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AS THE NEED FOR THEM ARISES.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF ITEMS NEEDED AT PRESENT.

Q25. Do you have an outline of what you want the selected contractor to perform?  

A25. NO.

Q26.Can you clarify the Story Board requirement in the solicitation? 

A26.A STORYBOARD SUMMARIZES THE CONTENT TO A RADIO, TV, OR PRINT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.

Q27. In the section labeled Evaluation Factors, Item A, it states that a writing sample (limited to 500 words) is to be included.  Is this writing sample separate from the actual proposal, or is the proposal considered the writing sample (and is not to exceed 500 words)? 

A27. THIS WRITING SAMPLE IS SEPARATE FROM THE ACTUAL PROPOSAL.

Q28. In the Contractor Qualifications section, it states that the contractor must be able to work with production and fulfillment houses.  Is the contractor expected to have its own fulfillment house, or is the contractor expected to work with NIH?s established fulfillment house?  And if the contractor is expected to have its own fulfillment house, what volume of orders can be anticipated? 

A28. THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A FULFILLMENT HOUSE.

Q29. Are you expecting firm price quotes for each of the four tasks under Deliverables?

A29. NO.

Q30. Is there an existing Communications/Outreach Plan in place that is driving these campaigns? If so, can they be provided to the prospective respondents?

A30. NO.

Q31. Is there a Media or PR Plan in place that will drive paid and earned media efforts? If so, can they be provided to the prospective respondents?

A31. NO.
Q32. You?ve asked for contractor experience in developing ?content management templates and libraries to be used in the development of online templates for national publication and use by remote offices.? Does this mean templates that will reside online and can be downloaded to create various PRINTED materials, or are the final products online only? 
A32. TEMPLATES THAT RESIDE ONLINE AND CAN BE DOWNLOADED TO CREATE VARIOUS PRINTED MATERIALS.
Q33. Would POP displays be used in doctor?s offices? Where else? By specialty items, are you referring to other promotional items such as pens, notepads, mugs, etc.? 
A33. YES TO BOTH QUESTIONS.
Q34. Is there a specific trade show/banner vendor you plan to use or will we be responsible for researching and selecting the trade show vendor? 
A34. WE DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC TRADE SHOW/BANNER VENDOR WE PLAN TO USE.  WE WOULD LOOK TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION OR SELECT ONE OURSELVES.
Q35. Does ?order fulfillment? management involve managing the production, printing & delivery to distribution centers of materials designed? Is there a component of on-going order fulfillment to store and distribute materials to end users? 
A35. ORDER FULFILLMENT MANAGEMENT INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION, PRINTING (SOMETIMES) AND DELIVERY TO DISTRIBUTION/FULFILLMENT HOUSE.
Q36. Please explain what kind of writing samples should be submitted? Does this proposal include writing text for all materials or will NLM supply content? 
A36. SEE RESPONSE TO QUESTION 17.  NLM WILL USUALLY SUPPLY/APPROVE THE TEXT.
Q37.Does NLM have a style guide for its overall branding? 
A37. YES.
Q38.Have any specific measures been determined to evaluate the success of the print materials after distribution? 
A38. NO.

APPENDIX A: GUIDE TO COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT AT THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY:    CAPSULE SUMMARY

Vendors can access the Policy via the World Wide Web. Its URL is http://www.nal.usda.gov/about/policy/coll_dev_toc.shtml  Following is a summary of the guide, which outlines the nature and extent of the Library?s collecting effort.]

Preface
The Collection Development Policy of the National Agricultural Library is intended to guide recommending officers, selectors and other staff in developing a cohesive collection. It also serves to inform NAL users, the agricultural community, and the public concerning the interests and pursuits of the Library. 
Mission of NAL
The National Agricultural Library (NAL) was established to fulfill the mission given to the U.S. Department of Agriculture "to acquire and to diffuse among the people of the United States useful information on subjects connected with agriculture and rural development, in the most general and comprehensive sense of those terms  and the duty "to acquire and preserve...all information concerning agriculture and rural development. 

PURPOSE OF POLICY
THIS COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE STATEMENTS REFLECTING CURRENT INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND OF THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY, BOTH NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE.

Some subjects, however, are prime collecting areas for several libraries, as veterinary medicine for both NAL and NLM and non-technical agriculture for both NAL and LC. Also, the requirements of Department staff often extend beyond the prime areas of agriculture into subjects covered by other collections necessitating acquisition in those subjects. The goal of the Library is to satisfy the needs of its users in the most effective method.

APPENDIX B:  Shelf-ready Specifications

 SHELF-READY BOOKS 
The contractor shall have the capability to prepare books for delivery to the Library in shelf-ready format.  
Shelf-ready requires affixing a bar code label, call number label and property label and on each book, as well as stamping a date of receipt on the title page.  
Book jackets shall be removed from the books.   They can be discarded.  
Accompanying materials that are non-print materials (CDs, DVDs, etc.) shall not receive shelf-ready processing, because they require special packaging for the stacks. They shall be sent to the Library in their original packaging. 
Bar code
The contractor shall affix one bar code label to each separately shelved book and accompanying text.  Bar code any accompanying materials that stand independently on the shelf in the same manner as that material would be labeled if it were a unique item in the collection.
A unique bar code number shall be used for each separately shelved book and accompanying text. The bar code shall be placed in squarely in the upper right-hand corner of the outside back cover. 
Call number label
One call number label shall be affixed to each separately shelved book and accompanying material.  The contractor shall also label any accompanying materials in the same manner as that material would be labeled if it were an individual item in the collection.  If a publication is issued in multiple parts, designations such as Avol.@ and Apt.@ etc. will be added at the bottom of the call number label. 
The contractor shall determine the width of the book?s spine.  If the spine is one inch or greater, a call number label shall be affixed to the pine, centered and approximately 1/4 in. from the bottom edge of the book.  If the spine is less than one inch, the contractor shall place the label squarely in the upper left- hand corner of the front cover, 1/4 in. from each edge.  The call number label shall be covered with transparent adhesive tape. 
Property labels   
Each book and accompanying text shall have an NAL property label affixed on the verso of the cover, in the center of the page.   If the property label covers important content, the property label shall be attached to the inside back cover of the book.   
Property stamp
A property stamp provided by NAL shall be applied at the bottom of the title page of each book.  The stamp indicates the date NAL received the book and the Department in which it was received.  The stamp should not block publication or other information.  Some flexibility on the placement of the stamp may be necessary if the placement of the stamp blocks important content.

As offeror?s technical proposals becomes more equal, price may become the determining factor.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are in the descending order of importance:   
Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach:  The proposal will be evaluated to determine the degree to which the proposal meets the ?Statement of Work (SOW)? and other solicitation requirements.  This includes understanding and identifying the difficulty and complexity of the SOW requirements; and providing services in a responsive and timely manner.  Offerors will be evaluated on their overall approach to managing the required service.  All samples will be evaluated for compliance with the Attachment I and II.  Offerors will be evaluated for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Voyager capability and certification compliance.  Warranties will be evaluated for compliance with commercial standards.  

Past Performance and Experience:  It will include a review of the offeror?s relevant history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, in addition to the offeror?s businesslike concerns for the interest of the customer.  The degree to which an offeror?s record demonstrates conformance to the ?Statement of Work?, standards of good workmanship and adherence to delivery and price schedules. 

Price:  Offerors? proposed prices in Section I.A will be evaluated by multiplying the quantities by the unit or per item price to derive a total estimated line item price.  All estimated line item prices will be added to determine the total estimated price for each period of performance.  The discount rates will be evaluated by multiplying the estimated quantities by the estimated cost per book times the proposed discount rate to derive the discounted amount for each line item for each period of performance for evaluation purposes only.  The estimated cost of each book for evaluation purposes is as follows:  Base Period - $80.00, Option Year I - $84.80, Option Year II - $89.89, Option Year III - $95.28, Option Year IV - $101.00 and Option Year V - $107.06.  The estimated cost per book applies to the Approval and Firm Order lines items only. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

STATEMENT OF WORK



1.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is the world?s largest and most accessible agricultural research library.  It plays a vital role in supporting research, education, and applied agriculture.  The NAL acquires and preserves agricultural and related literature from throughout the world in all formats and languages.  The Library?s mission is to support research and knowledge in agriculture and related disciplines through the dissemination and exchange of information by researchers and other professionals.  Core to its collection are publications in agriculture, food and the life sciences published worldwide by commercial, societal, and government bodies.  At the end of FY 2006, the NAL collection stood at approximately 6.1 million items including book and serial volumes, government documents, audiovisuals and computer software packages, manuscripts, prints and photographs. 

An important component of the environment at NAL is our Ex Libris (formerly Endeavor Library System) Voyager Integrated Library System (Voyager). Voyager allows users access via the web to both our AGRICOLA Online Public Catalog and AGRICOLA Journal Index. (http://agricola.nal.usda.gov/).

The Voyager System is also used to manage the collection development and acquisitions operations of the Library, which includes electronic ordering and invoicing functions.  

The NAL Online Catalog is updated daily and contains the most current bibliographic citations for books, reports, maps, journals/periodicals, audiovisuals, CD-ROMs and other electronic media, and other materials added to the NAL collection.  It also serves as an agricultural union catalog that includes citations for materials at the U.S. National Arboretum Library. Un-cataloged, in-process, and on-order titles also are including in the catalog and it is the most current source of AGRICOLA  bibliographic records. 


1.1   PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE

The purpose of the acquisition is to provide monographs and related services to NAL through firm orders and approval plans in agriculture, food, and related subject areas.  NAL will place orders online using the Contractor?s computer based online order processing system.  


1.2   GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF SERVICE 

All monographs and related materials shall be provided primarily in the form of English language materials but not exclusively from the United States and United Kingdom.  


1.3    APPROVAL PLANS AND FIRM ORDERS

The Contractor shall provide monographs, monographic series, and related materials in accordance with NAL developed approval plans and issuance of firm orders which shall be shipped from a centralized Contractor location.  NAL will develop an approval plan, structured in accordance with the configuration of the Contractor?s online order processing system, and provide within 60 days after award.   Regularly recurring titles and monographic series are to be treated as items shipped on approval and not as standing orders. The Contractor shall perform associated claiming at regular intervals, and also in response to NAL claim notices.

REVISED STATEMENT OF WORK:

1.	Statement of work

The purpose of this contract is to provide Labview programming support to the CDRH Calibration Laboratory due to the White Oak move and transition to PC based software.  Upon completion of programming by vendor, CDRH has ownership and all rights to access and modify the LabView program.   Adequate documentation will be provided to verify that CDRH requirements were met.  Vendor will provide Labview programming in stages to insure that the quality of work is meeting the needs of the X-ray Calibration Laboratory.  The final product will meet ADA requirements.

General requirements

The computer control system supplies a level of automation over the x-ray system to provide streamlined control, calibration, and monitoring. This automation is focused in four areas: ion
chamber calibration, exposure rate calculation, automatic set up, and irradiator calibration. The computer control system uses a computer and optically isolated inputs and outputs to monitor
and control the irradiator. An indexer controls the motors of the positioning track. An IEEE-488.2 card is used to communicate with electrometers. The x-ray system is monitored and controlled via an RS-232 connection.

The control software is powerful yet designed to be simple to use. The core program is LabVIEW, a Windows-based program that is ideally suited for this type of application. It is very
easy for an operator to use on a routine basis. Only information for routine use is presented to the operator. Selection of options is clear and unambiguous. Status of all system components is shown in a concise display. The control software is designed on a modular approach for functions. Operation screens are set up and customized to exactly match an irradiator. Command modules are written for each feature of the irradiator. Because of the modular design, additional
features can be added easily and seamlessly after the system has been installed.

Ion Chamber Calibration. The control system takes the rradiator, ion chambers, and electrometers through a number of steps that result in a calibration data set and report. When this
process is started, a set up screen appears allowing the operator to configure such things as: source selection and desired exposure rate, electrometer settings of current vs. charge mode, ion chamber voltage, number of exposures, and exposure time. When the operator starts the calibration, the track is moved to position (if the track is automated), the source exposed, and the data collected. The electrometer is polled based on the set up. Data is written to a database as
each point is finished. When the first ion chamber is completed, exposures begin for the second ion chamber (typically the reference chamber). When the second chamber is finished, the data is written to a spreadsheet and/or a report generated. This routine can be easily modified to fit a customer?s specific procedure.

Exposure Rate Calculation. With the power of the computer available for calculations, the irradiator control system can calculate the track?s X-axis distance based on a desired exposure
rate. This calculation includes is based on a polynomial equation that precisely matches the measurement data collected for that beam code/current/position combination. When current is
changed, the exposure rate for that position is calculated. The same arrangement holds for time and exposure ? when one is changed, the other is calculated and displayed.

Automatic Set-Up. The automatic set up routine speeds up instrument or dosimeter calibration and increases accuracy by quickly configuring the irradiator to match a procedure. With the
change of one button, this routine configures source, attenuator, track position or exposure rate, and time or exposure. These configurations are arranged in procedures and steps that the user defines. Whenever the operator changes a step, the irradiator is re-configured to match that step.

Irradiator Calibration. The irradiator calibration requires that hundreds of data points be collected to determine exposure rates for distances along the positioning track. This data must
be collected for each source and each attenuator. With the computer control system, this process is automated. The computer is connected to the electrometer via IEEE 488.2 interface. The irradiator control system presents a set up screen that allows the operator to specify distances, exposure time, and number of exposures at each position. Once the operator starts the exposure, the control system performs the exposures at each position, collects the exposure rate from electrometer and saves it to a file. The automated sequence continues until all data is collected. An equation curve fit program is used to fit the data to a polynomial equation. The equation is then coded into the software control program.   The computer based control system enhances ease-of-use by automating and simplifying steps of the calibration process.  It handles the mundane, repetitive tasks and lets the operator concentrate on the calibration procedure.
The source code is supplied with modification rights for all LabVIEW applications. Support is  included for helping adapt the software to FDA?s existing techniques and procedures.

<DESC>This hereby amends Solicitation Number SB1341-07-RQ-0207 to answer questions from industry.  The questions and answers are as follows:

QUESTION:
Item 8.  Because you will be using the MPA-3 Multiparameter Data
System, we would propose not including digitized outputs on the Model 2401B Position Analyzer, but only the analog X and Y outputs.   The digital versions for the MPA-3 would be produced by external NIM ADC's ? they interface to the MPA-3 more easily than do our internal digitizer outputs so we suggest going that way.  And, our internal digitizers have a longer add-on deadtime than the external NIM ones.  Is that acceptable?

ANSWER:
This is acceptable.  Item # 8 simply requires that a computer will record the events detected by the MCP/Encoder, and that a real-time clock is used to get better timing resolution (about 50 ns)--better than can be provided by the computer clock.  Current applications do not require digitized outputs via external NIM ADC's.  However, the option for such an upgrade in the future is a desired feature.


QUESTION:
Item 8/10.   The time of arrival signal (any better than 500 nsec uncertainty) has to be developed from an MCP timing signal obtained from the last MCP in the detector by a special optional pickoff circuit (simple decoupling network).  This low level signal has to be carefully processed by a preamp (inverting), a CFD, TAC/ADC and then fed to the third input parameter of the MPA-3 for recording, as you mention in the RFQ.  Are these items (preamp, CFD, TAC/ADC, timing cables etc) to be included or not in the quote?

ANSWER:
No, the components necessary for sub-nanosecond timing are NOT to be included in the quote.  Item # 10 is intended for future upgrades.  NIST requires a system which can be upgraded to higher timing precision, but this is for future development.  Item # 10 requires this possibility, but the components associated with item # 10 are NOT included in this requisition.


QUESTION:
Item 12.  HV Divider/HV power supply.  Do you want these included in the quote?

ANSWER: 
Yes, both HV divider and the HV power supply should be included in the quote.  The HV divider is for the 40mm diameter MCP/RAE with 3 MCP for high resolution.  The power supply must range 0 to 4 kV with 3 mA rating, NIM module type with digital display.


All other terms and conditions remain the same.
