<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PKPA) solicits research proposals for the Integrated Vehicle Energy Technology Demonstration program (INVENT) which will be performed by two platform teams working either together or in competition in Phase 1. It is also anticipated that each team would be led by an airframer and supported by multiple utility subsystem, vehicle system and engine suppliers together in an Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) setting. This effort will design, develop and ground test an integrated suite of energy, power, and thermal advanced technologies based on the INVENT consensus architecture. This effort will consist of critical subsystems and vehicle system technology integrations and demonstrations that ameliorate the risks identified by the INVENT consensus architecture studies. Component technology and subsystem development work will be done outside of this effort. The three critical INVENT subsystem demonstrations identified are defined as 1. Adaptive Power &amp; Thermal Management System, 2. Robust Electrical Power System, and 3. High Performance Electric Actuation System. Integrated designs shall be developed using high fidelity modeling and simulation techniques at an air system level to validate the approach achieves the expected benefits identified by the INVENT consensus architecture study. Installed benefits as well as performance oriented capabilities enhancements will be evaluated throughout the course of the program to show a solid transition path to the contractor's chosen platform. As a minimum, at least one platform shall be chosen as the basis for their effort from the INVENT near term portfolio (subsonic LRS, UAV, or Tactical). Risk based planning will encompass ground testing through engine integration and flight test.&nbsp; Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.</p>

<DESC>The Long Range Anti-Ship Missile Demonstration program is a joint DARPA/ONR effort to rapidly develop and demonstrate a ship launched standoff anti-ship strike weapon capable of achieving mission kill against selective surface targets at significant standoff ranges.  The program will develop technologies that enable U.S. surface platforms to engage other surface units from well outside direct counter-fire ranges, with inherent capability to ensure weapon survivability against advanced defensive systems.  The program should achieve robust integrated flight test of a prototype system no later than three years after contract award.  Proposers are encouraged to provide best performance solutions based on innovative application of technologies that can realistically achieve flight status within this timeframe.  Consideration should be given to terminal survivability and lethality approaches that are effective against current and projected ship defensive systems.  The extensibility of terminal systems to future delivery vehicles with enhanced range, speed, or launch platform flexibility is also of interest.

Refer to the attachment for a complete copy of the DARPA-BAA-08-41.  The initial proposal due date is August 6, 2008.  The closing date for the BAA is June 6, 2009.

Currently, QIAGEN Corporations testing systems reside at many of the MTFs on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  QIAGENs HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables provide the only FDA approved option for the MTFs to perform HPV testing.  QIAGENs test kits are specifically configured to support QIAGENs testing systems employed at many of the MTFs.  No other manufacturer or distributor sells or has access to these products manufactured by QIAGEN.  Only QIAGEN has the capability of providing the required items. 
 
During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using QIAGEN Corporations Chlamydia (CT) and Gonorrhea (GC) test kits which operate under the same testing systems as the HPV test kits and will be procured under this solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  QIAGEN will be asked to provide a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog for each system-Hc2 and RCS and an Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog for each system on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP ECAT system.  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Acknowledgment and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgments, send 855-Order Acknowledgments and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are two communication strategies available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and the American Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI standard for direct EDI.  QIAGEN Corporation must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.  

The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $4.9 million.

The project involves sorting cancer stem cells using a functional assay: the side population.  In order to use this assay a sorter must have UV laser capabilities. Moreover, because solid organ cancer cells are large and heterogeneous the fluidics and capture chamber of the system need to be modify to this extent. In addition, these types of cells can be captured only with UV of 100mw. The only known machine with such specifications is the BD FACSAria II Special Order System with UV laser capability (100mV).  BD Biosciences is the sole supplier as the BD FACSAria is the only known machine in existence that can sort stem cells (via the side population technique).  There are no other known cell sorters that have these capabilities. This is very unique trait to this machine. It has a special UV laser that was modified to sort stem cells using the side population properties.  In addition, it is the only 100mv laser in existence in cell sorters. This gives the machine the capability to sort large cancer stem cells. There are no other options to obtain these cells (side population cancer stem cells).

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

Period of Performance: Performance shall be for one year from date of award with two one year option periods.
Population-based investigations of genetic and environmental causes of complex diseases can help develop effective public health strategies for prevention and interventions. The Integrated Analysis of Genetic and Environmental Data in Epidemiologic Studies will develop efficient and robust statistical methods for the discovery and characterization of genetic and environmental determinants of complex diseases by integrated analysis of gene-environment data in modem, population-based molecular epidemiologic studies. The methods developed as part of this project will be applied to analyze state-of-the-art population based studies in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. User-friendly software will be developed, tested, and distributed for wider use of the analytic methods. 
Purpose:
The specific goals of the project include:   
1.	Development of Statistical methods for Studies of Candidate Genes in Biologic Pathways in the Presence of Measured Environmental Co-factors 
2.	Using Data on Environmental Risk Factors to Improve Design and Analysis of Two Stage Genome-Wide Association Studies 
3.	Empirical Evaluation of Statistical Tools Based on Three Case-Control Molecular Epidemiologic Studies 

Professor Raymond Carroll is a distinguished statistical researcher known for his seminal work in a variety of topics relevant for the proposed study, including semi-parametric methods, case control studies, penalized regression and missing data.  Professor Carroll is the best person-the only person-suitable for this contract.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure as a sole source for the brand name TECAN Infinite M200 Monochromator-based Modular Multi-function Microplate Reader and components.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The overall goal of the NCI laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Specifically, the NCI will investigate the genetic basis of strong association signals identified in candidate gene association studies, loci identified by linkage analyses in high-risk families, or genome-wide association studies (GWAS), particularly the loci identified by the ongoing Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) program.

The goal of functional studies is to determine the mechanisms of gene function and how they are perturbed in disease. This research utilizes molecular biology, immunological, genetic and biochemical technologies. These include but is not limited to the following procedures: fine mapping of candidate loci, DNA and RNA quantification, protein quantification, reporter gene assays, cell viability and toxicity assays, immunoassays, enzyme assays and binding assays.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b) and 13.501-(a)(1)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification

In order for the NCI laboratory to carry out functional studies of candidate genetic variants, we need the following capabilities: high-throughput UV and VIS absorbance, fluorescence top & bottom read with spectral emission scans in 1nm increments from 280  850nm, dual color luminescence measurements, dual injectors, and a cuvette port.  

The TECAN Infinite M200 Monochromator-based Modular Multi-function Microplate Reader is a single high-quality, easy-to-use instrument that incorporates the aforementioned detection methods needed to conduct our research.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with DME Corporation located in Orlando, FL. The Government intends to procure Interim Spare and Repair Parts required to support initial fielding of H-60 Hybrid Test Station (HTS) Lot II Offload to Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) 04 ON-678/USM-636(V), 05 ON-674/USM-636(V), 06 ON-676/USM-636(V), 08 ON-679/USM-636(V), and 09 ON-673/USM-636(V) in December 2008, under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The HTS spare parts are required to support the CASS OTPSs, which are being designed and developed by DME Corporation. Although a complete technical data package for these OTPSs is a part of the design phase, the Government will not take delivery of this technical data package early enough to support competitive procurement of these interim spare and repair parts. Initial fielding of the CASS OTPSs is scheduled for December 2008; therefore, spares to accommodate the fielding of the initial OTPSs will be required in September 2008. A complete technical data package will not be available until August 2008 and a 3 month lead time to produce the spares is anticipated. Spares must be of the same configuration as the production items and only DME Corporation can ensure that any design changes to the production unit will also be incorporated into the spares.

<RESPDATE>062008
<CONTACT>Dawn H. Caracci, Contracting Officer, Phone 4109659465, Email dawn.caracci@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to enter into a SOLE SOURCE procurement with the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine (NAS/IOM), to establish an independent, external standing committee of medical experts to advise policymakers as part of SSAs ongoing efforts to keep the Listings of Impairments (the Listings) up to date (20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1).  NAS/IOM is the only organization with intimate understanding of the Listings and past experience examining them, the ability to generate FACA-compliant reports, and the experience and academic authority to oversee large-scale scientific programs, access recognized, unbiased experts and scientific knowledge, provide neutral review of scientific research, and lend credibility to reports and other work products with individuals and organizations with interest in science and public policy, such as the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government, the scientific and research communities, and the general public. BACKGROUND: SSA previously contracted with the IOM for advice on how to maximize the Listings as a viable screening tool.  In its 2007 Final Report, Improving the Social Security Disability Decision Process, the IOM recommended that the SSA reestablish a medical advisory committee and appropriate ad hoc committees to advise SSA on revising the Listings using up-to-date medical literature and technology in order to improve the Listings accuracy and currency.  REQUIREMENTS: SSA plans to award a new three-year sole source contract to NAS/IOM.  NAS/IOM will establish an independent, external standing committee of medical experts to advise policymakers as a part of SSAs ongoing efforts to keep the Listings up to date; meet with SSA and gather information necessary to establish the committee; select and convene FACA-compliant consensus study committees; issue short reports; advise SSA on new medical developments and objective measures to improve accuracy and currency of the Listings; organize workshops or roundtable discussions for debate and analysis of emerging issues; and, develop ideas for specific studies for the Listings. Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required herein should submit a capability statement to Dawn Caracci via email at dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked SSA-RFP-08-1075, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received in writing no later than June 20, 2008, 3:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a solicitation will be issued directly to NAS/IOM.  TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Reference Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia announces its intention to invite comments and suggestions on a draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the implementation of the USAID/ETHIOPIA Urban Agriculture Program for HIV/AIDS Affected Women & Children. This new Urban Agriculture Program for HIV/AIDS Affected Women & Children is designed to improve the nutritional status and food security of households affected by or living with HIV/AIDS. This activity focuses on services to expand urban agriculture opportunities for low income HIV/AIDS-affected households, particularly those headed by females and orphans.
Through this activity, beneficiaries are expected to acquire the skills and means to enable them to:  increase food production; enhance household food availability; promote consumption of a balanced nutritious diet; improve family income through the sale of food surplus; and realize alternative livelihoods. By building on experience to date, this activity will expand areas where urban agriculture support for HIV-affected households and OVC are available and increase the number of beneficiaries.  

Four components are envisioned: 1) Technical and Other Support of Urban Agriculture for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and OVC; 2) Building Capacity of Local Non-Government Organizations; 3) Strengthening Food and Income Generation Linkages with Care and Treatment Networks; and 4) Management and Evaluation Information Systems. Implementation is expected to include partnerships with on-going efforts to support OVC, community-based palliative care and treatment programs, and HIV counseling and testing outreach services. Success in undertaking the components of the Project is defined as having created new food security options and additional income-generating opportunities for PLWHA and their families. Measurement of that success must be evidence-based.   

The final version of the Request for Proposals (RFP) may be issued in early March 2008. USAID/Ethiopia invites comments and suggestions on the attached draft SOW. Firms, organizations, and individuals eligible to compete, experts in the area of nutrition and food security, HIV/AIDS, and micro-enterprise activities and other interested parties are strongly encouraged to review and comment on the draft and to consider submitting a Proposal in response to the resulting RFP. The purpose of posting this draft is to enhance the quality of the SOW. Comments and suggestions received may be considered as the RFP is finalized. USAID reserves the rights to incorporate suggestions and comments and/or to reject suggestions and comments on the draft SOW.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611512  Aviation Training.  An Industry Day is scheduled at MCB Camp LeJeune for 1 Jul 2008.  Parties interested in attending must register with the Contracting Officer prior to 27 June 2008.  A Draft RFP and SOW are attached.  A final RFP is expected to be issued on 1 August 2008.

Box : 9550 SOS, Children Village, Cairo  11787, Tel : 202 22719320, Fax : 202 22739023 Cairo, Tel.:203 2020888, Fax : 203 2020777 Alexandria, EMAIL: mzaki@estyrenics.com

Alexandria Styrene Plant Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an Alexandria Styrene Plant.

A feasibility study is required to investigate the technical, economic and marketing feasibility of implementing a styrene plant in Alexandria, Egypt.  The styrene plant would be built in parallel with a polystyrene plant that is currently under design. This study will examine two styrene production capacities of 300,000 metric tons annually (MTA) and 600,000 MTA.  The Grantee would like to construct a styrene plant sized to provide all the necessary feedstock for the polystyrene plant, which would reduce feedstock costs and provide a secure supply.  Accordingly, the contractor shall show the effect of constructing a styrene/polystyrene complex as an integrated project based on economical indicators for the following feedstock scenarios:

	totally and partially imported ethylene and benzene,
	local ethylene and imported benzene, and
	local ethylene and benzene.

The feasibility study will consider styrene/polystyrene markets for both Egyptian domestic consumption and export.  The basis for costs and economics used in the study shall be transparent and clearly described by the Contractor.

The Egyptian Styrenics production company (E-Styrenics) is a part of the Egyptian petrochemical integrated plan.  The company employs more than 40 people in their main office.  This number is expected to grow to be 200 employees at a full capacity production state.   E-Styrenics has more than US$ 300 million of total assets, US$ 260 million of polystyrene production capacity, and US$ 46.8 million of revenues.  E-Styrenics is one of Egypts largest petrochemical concerns.  The companys products include DVD cases, plastic drins bottles, sterile medical devices, biological contact materials and institutional feeding systems.

E-Styrenics is asking the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to fund the proposed feasibility study, i.e., the pre-FEED, for the Phase II styrene plant that will investigate the technical, economic, and marketing feasibility of manufacturing 300,000 (MTA) to 600,000 MTA of styrene as part of an integrated complex with the Phase I polystyrene plant.  The feasibility study for the complex will gather information, and expand and analyze data to enable E-Styrenics to:

	Determine the techno-economic viability of the project as a business investment opportunity.
	Establish market viability.
	Generate interest in management, shareholders, and financial institutions for debt financing.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $434,268 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp

 Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m. NOON, August 8, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a Request for Information (RFI).

The RFP number W91QUZ-08-R-0047 was entered as a requirement to allow the posting of this RFI.  Therefore, the use of W91QUZ-08-R-0047 is not an indication of future action, beyond this RFI.<BR><BR>This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201e.

Responses to this notice shall not be construed as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued.  The release of AKO/DKO documentation is limited to United States corporations and United States citizens. <BR><BR>The Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO-EIS) and other DoD agencies seek information and comment regarding potential strategies for the design, development, installation and operation and maintaining of the world largest corporate intranet.  Known initially as Army Knowledge Online (AKO), this intranet is transitioning, expanding and being recast as AKO and Defense Knowledge Online (AKO/DKO).  While a significant amount of the transformation has occurred, not all technologies, tools and methods have been finalized. PEO-EIS anticipates awarding an AKO/DKO follow-on support contract before March 2010.  While the reengineering effort is not assured, the multi-service DoD team seeks to investigate potential solutions and architecture approaches that identify best practices, migration strategies, and technologies that will advance DoD knowledge management.  <BR><BR>Questions regarding this RFI will not be entertained.  The Army intends to issue a draft RFP in the 4th Quarter of FY08 which will provide additional information.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the purposes of this RFI and eventual draft RFP is 541519, with an associated small business size of $23 Million dollars. <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White<BR>Paper, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, and supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed ten (10) slides. Contractors are urged to limit marketing material in order to provide more substantive information in their response.  Responses are to be submitted via e-mail, in Microsoft Word, 2003 compatible, to Woodrow Bell, at drow.bell@us.army.mil, not later than 9 July 2008. If there are any questions, Mr. Bell can be reached by phone at (703) 325-4760.<BR><BR>AKO/DKO BACKGROUND: AKO/DKO is being built on the current AKO enterprise portal structure.  AKO was started as a pilot project in 1997 and was so successful that the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff mandated that all data, information and systems be moved behind this portal.  The AKO portal represented the first step in building the Army intranet.  AKO is the principal tool used in transforming the Army to a knowledge based organization. The current AKO/DKO is constructed around Appian Enterprise business process management (BPM) technologies with many customized Enterprise Content Management (ECM) features. <BR><BR>The current AKO/DKO enterprise portal provides Army and DoD personnel with access to business related and mission-oriented knowledge in real time.  At present, the AKO/DKO enterprise portal, consists of a primary site at Fort Belvoir, a secondary site in Maryland, and a third site in Southwest Asia. All sites are connected to both unclassified, but sensitive nonsecure internet protocol router (NIPRNet) and secret internet protocol router (SIPRNet) networks.  The scope includes systems operation and maintenance, network and systems engineering support, hardware and software integration, software development and maintenance, application development and maintenance, Army-wide help desk support, and senior level technology and program management support services. Services are provided on a continuous 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year basis.   AKO/DKO provides single sign-on access to over 400 applications and experiences approximately 800,000 unique users 15 million times per month with peak bandwidth usage of 500 Mbps.  DKO also provides user access to the DODs core enterprise services of DISAs Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) program.  A key tenet of DKO is that it uses, and does not duplicate, services provided by NCES on the DODs NIPRNET and SIPRNET, for purposes of both cost efficiency and to promote interoperability and information sharing within the DOD, and amongst DODs Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational Mission (JIIM) partners.  <BR><BR> GovWorks, Department of Interiors contracting office, competitively awarded the original AKO contract in June 2002.  The final option period on that contract expired on 30 Sep 07.  As an interim solution, a task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman (NG) on 5 March 2007 against the Air Forces NETCENTS contract until emerging requirements could be stabilized.  If the final option period is exercised, this task order will expire in March 2010.  Since 2002, the Army has spent approximately $425M on the Program.  The Not to Exceed Amount on the present task order is $267M with a remainder of approximately $112 million before expiration of the task order.  <BR><BR>ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIAL: The Government may make reference/reading material available.  If reference/reading material is made available, an amendment to this notice will be issued with instructions.  <BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>The primary acquisition objective of AKO/DKO is to obtain a solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a standard Information Technology infrastructure to support the Government in meeting both the AKO and DKO missions.  As such, the Government anticipates that some or all of the following objectives of this requirement will be as follows:<BR><BR>a.  Building on the current AKO/DKO solution (hardware, software, infrastructure), provide a best-in-class, secure, interoperable, scalable, and upgradeable solution for AKO and DKO that focuses on a user-friendly interface, rapid access to on-line content and applications and outstanding customer service for approximately 2.5 million AKO and 8 million  DKO end-users.  Note: The number of users is an initial estimate only.  The number of users ultimately provided service pursuant to AKO and DKO could vary drastically, either more or less, than the stated number of users.  As a rule of thumb, the population of users to be supported on the SIPRNET is approximately 15% of those on unclassified networks.<BR><BR>b. Ensure a seamless/transparent transition from other portals to DKO per the DKO Continuity of Operations (CONOPS), and from the existing contract to this contract, improving current process standards and procedures.<BR><BR>c. Under a performance-based arrangement, award to a contractor committed to delivering a, highly reliable, user friendly, timely, and secure IT solution that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations.  Incentives that reward offerors that provide a method for DoD to save costs and encourage the shutdown of other portals across DoD in favor of using DKO are being contemplated.<BR><BR>d. Provide evolutionary, robust and user-friendly enterprise portal Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) toolsets capable of integrating best of breed in messaging, work flow, collaboration suites, content management, data retrieval search, taxonomy, and other services as required.<BR><BR>e. Assure that AKO and DKO services are provided to any connected AKO and DKO user anywhere at any time  to include a network-challenged environment.  The system must be responsive and reliable to users at the network edge.  Provide responsive and competent user assistance available 24/7.  <BR><BR>f. Assure DKO provides ubiquitous access to DoD and non DoD web-based business applications and is interoperable with the DoD Enterprise Architecture.  <BR><BR>g. Ensure security compliance/information assurance, including physical security, for AKO and DKO, its data, and users.<BR><BR>h. Provide security architecture that is scalable to 8 million users.  Consider DODD 8500 series including FIPS 140-2 compliance for both data in transit and data at rest.<BR><BR>i. Provide the single entry point (single sign-on) into the DoD network through DKO allowing common access, security, authentication, and presentation solution (common look and feel) for all DoD network services.  Solution should be a modular, plug-and-play, standalone design.  As single sign-on may alternatively be provided from some other government source, a standards-based interface would have to be provided to enable this function to operate seamlessly within the DKO enterprise portal.<BR><BR>j. Provide an architecture that demonstrates the capability to provide external    policy management capability for AKO and DKO, and the ability to deny access to areas within the portal based on policy management decisions, in compliance with DoD standards.<BR><BR>k. Ensure DKO continues to operate at required levels (including Continuity of Operations (COOP)/DR) (spell out DR) during any software or hardware changes, upgrades or disasters.<BR><BR>l. Ensure new capabilities are adequately tested to prevent adverse impact to operations or the users experience during portal modifications and upgrades.  Provide user training to increase awareness of DKO functionality.  <BR><BR>m. Provide market research and recommendations focused on continuous capability improvements.  Provide a roadmap for future DKO improvements with an established and predictable release cycle.<BR><BR>n. Provide Help Desk services for customer service and technical reporting purposes.  Operations should be 24/7/365 and available to all AKO and DKO users.  Offeror may, but is not required to maintain the current Help Desk operations and can propose alternative arrangements.  Offeror must propose performance standards applicable to this type of operation.<BR><BR>o. The AKO/DKO enterprise portal must be able to support both convergence and federation of other DoD portals depending on business and mission needs.<BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:  <BR><BR>This contract will be a systems integration contract to both operate and maintain the current AKO/DKO enterprise portal and to design, install, transition and maintain the future AKO and DKO portal(s) in accordance with the concepts outlined in the DKO Strategic Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  The DKO enterprise portal will provide universal, secure access for world-wide DoD operations.  DKO will be the single point of entry into the DoDs Intranets (including AKO) for both the business side and for deployed personnel to achieve reach-back to their sustaining bases for essential mission and critical support processes, especially for forces in remote geographic areas such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  The future AKO/DKO enterprise portal(s) will be designed in such a way that there will be no virtual loss of functionality to the current AKO requirements.<BR><BR>SCOPE:<BR><BR>CURRENT SYSTEM:<BR><BR>It is expected that the successful offeror will have complete program management responsibility at all three sites.   The scope includes systems operation and maintenance, network and systems engineering support, hardware and software integration, software development and maintenance, application development and maintenance, DoD-wide help desk support, and senior level technology and program management support services. Services must be provided, without disruption, on a continuous 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year basis.   The successful offeror will provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to DoD personnel (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines); Active, National Guard, and Reserve soldiers and their sponsored guests; DoD Civilians; applicable contractors; and JIMM partners.<BR><BR>FUTURE SYSTEM:<BR><BR>Contingent on available funding, the future AKO and DKO enterprise portal(s) system(s) may be moved into an Army Area Processing Center (APC) and/or within Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC).  These systems may either entail the use of space leased within these facilities with government-purchased equipment and application software installed (but with government rights instilled) or the use of DISA or contractor-provided managed services for equipment needs and the contractor application software installed.  The contractor would be responsible for all coordination efforts necessary for the moves.  In addition to the three current physical sites, additional in-country and/or overseas sites may be added to add security, capacity and functionality. The reengineered AKO/DKO intranet must scale to 8 million users, including active duty and retired service personnel, their family members and contractors, and possibly other government agencies.  <BR><BR>ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT:<BR><BR>a. A successful offeror must be able to operate the AKO/DKO enterprise portal as soon as possible after contract award; complete implementation of the ongoing system upgrades already in progress; and then transition to a leadership role in the technical, managerial and organizational evolution of the AKO and DKO enterprise portal without disruption to current AKO/DKO services and capabilities.  <BR><BR>b. The successful offeror will play a significant role in creating the most efficient and effective AKO/DKO enterprise portal using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts in the DoDs Service Oriented Environment, and the most up-to-date, modular plug-and-play applications. The Government will consider both new and existing system designs in both software and underlying hardware platforms to provide a continuous, high-quality service to AKO and DKO users.<BR><BR>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: <BR><BR>a. The AKO/DKO Enterprise Services contractor will have the responsibility for the continued development of AKO and DKO functionality. The Government seeks help in identifying AKO and DKO user needs, back-end business application needs, and overall functional enhancements. The Government also seeks the establishment of strong processes to formalize the development and facilitate the prioritization of AKO and DKO improvements.<BR><BR>b. With regards to FAR subpart 27-Rights and Copyrights, the contractor shall be required to provide the Government with sufficient technical and non-technical data and data rights, computer software, software documentation and software rights, as well as rights in other relevant information and documentation.  The rights received or retained by the Government must be sufficient to ensure that the form, fit, function and appearance of the AKO and DKO can be preserved for any follow-on award.<BR><BR>CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS: The current AKO/DKO systems infostructure consists mainly of contractor and government-owned components. The Government furnishes some government furnished equipment (GFE), as well as the facilities at the primary and secondary sites. The primary and secondary sites are exact images of each other, each sharing the AKO/DKO user load. The current contractor provides AKO/DKO as a service using, in part, the GFE. The Government is presently considering several alternatives with regards to the acquisition strategy.  They include but are not limited to a managed solution, also called managed services, or a co-location arrangement:<BR><BR>For the purposes of this potential acquisition a Management Service Provider or Managed Service Provider (MSP) is an organization that would manage AKO/DKO computer systems and networks which are located on DoD premises or at a third-party datacenter.  MSPs offer a variety of service levels from notifying the Government if problems occur to making all necessary repairs.  MSPs may also be a source for hardware and staff for its AKO/DKO customers.   A service provider may also simply deliver infrastructure management services on a subscription basis, similar to the model used by application service providers.  <BR><BR>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), also known as on-demand software delivery.<BR><BR>The Government may seek to move existing Army GFE from the Fort Belvoir and Maryland sites to a Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and procure system management support services.   In this case, the Government would require the Army GFE be moved to the DECC.  Any additional equipment needed for the system would be Government provided through the DECC.<BR><BR>The Government is presently considering two options to meet its requirements as follows:<BR><BR>Option 1. <BR><BR> a.  In this option, the contractor will be required to operate and maintain the current system in one or more possible scenarios. Under one scenario, it is expected that the Government will provide the necessary hosting facilities at the current location. However, funding constraints may prevent the Government from acquiring or leasing all the equipment necessary for AKO/DKO to function.  Consequently, the Government may not be able to provide as all GFE necessary to operate and maintain AKO/DKO.  In this event, the selected contractor may be required to use its own equipment and resources to operate and maintain the AKO/DKO.  As part of this option, the contractor will likely also be required to propose to operate the system as a managed service at the present three locations. The offeror will be required to propose such a solution and an associated transition plan.  <BR><BR>b. A different scenario involves moving the equipment presently owned by the Government from its present location at the Fort Belvoir and Maryland sites to a DECC.  In this case, the offeror would be required to move the GFE to the DECC.  Any additional equipment needed for the system would be furnished by the DECC and furnished to the contractor as GFE.  The offeror would be required to coordinate the effort on behalf of the government.  The offeror will be required to propose such a solution to ensure operation during and after the transition to the DECC, and an associated transition plan.  <BR><BR>c. In either case, the contractor will be required to design a future solution for an entirely new AKO/DKO system to be located in at least two DECCs and the associated transition plan.  The equipment at the Southwest Asia site will remain in place.<BR><BR>Option 2. <BR><BR>Depending on the supporting business case and availability of funding, a different approach may be pursued.  Instead of being required to maintain the current AKO/DKO system in-place, the contractor would be required to immediately design, install, and maintain a new AKO/DKO equipment and software design at two or more DECCs using managed services. The offeror would be required to coordinate the effort on behalf of the government and to provide a plan for the transition of services from the existing contractor to the new DECC facilities. The contractor would be required to show that this approach was technically superior, and could be provided at a reduced cost.<BR><BR>Alternative Solution.<BR><BR>The contractor may present an alternate solution under the RFI.<BR>.  <BR>PERFORMANCE-BASED ACQUISITION (PBA): The AKO/DKO contract, if awarded, may use performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Statement of Objectives or a Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>TERM: The AKO/DKO contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with at least four one-year options.<BR><BR>QUESTIONS: The Government is requesting comments on the above options, and is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the RFP. <BR><BR>1.   How difficult would it be to implement a solution in which the Government provides a limited set of equipment as GFE?  In this event the Government would likely not be in a position to acquire or lease all equipment necessary for AKO/DKO to function.  Rather, the contractor would be required to provide AKO/DKO as a service using its own resources.  Please explain the advantages and disadvantages with this approach.<BR>2.   What factors should the Government consider when determining whether to transition DKO from one Content Management System (CMS) to another, i.e., from one support model to another? <BR>3. Is a partial managed service agreement practical, where the Government and service provider divide AKO/DKO services in both the classified and unclassified environments?  What about dividing between the classified and unclassified environments? Is a public-private partnership feasible to deliver AKO/DKO?<BR>4. With regards to FAR Subpart 27, what other factors should be considered regarding software licenses and Configuration Management?  How would you recommend handling software licenses issues?<BR>5. What specific detail or additional information beyond the information provided in the reading room is needed in order to bid on the complete requirement?<BR>6. What contract type(s) would be most beneficial to both the Government and the<BR>contractor?<BR>7. How long would it take to transition from the existing contract to the new contract?<BR>8. What logical portions of work are suitable for small business (SB) participation on an<BR>effort of this size?  What SB subcontracting goals have you achieved on similar efforts?   <BR>9. What contractual incentives would motivate outstanding performance? In what areas can performance most effectively be incentivized?<BR>10. If the Government decides on a fully MSP, what performance areas should be incentivized?  What metrics are typically used?)<BR>11. What portal and data/content management best practices are used by industry?<BR>12. How does industry leverage portals to ensure effective support to multi-functional<BR>elements of the organization, and what lessons learned can they share? <BR>13. How would you monitor DKO service availability and quality?<BR>14.  With regards to future trends, what should the Government consider in assessing future capabilities?<BR>15. What are the industry standards for portal maintenance? What are the cost drivers unique to portal maintenance?<BR>16.  If the Government chooses SaaS, how would you propose the Government determine ownership of the services?<BR>17. What would be a rough order of magnitude of cost for both Option 1 and Option 2 and any proposed Alternative Solution?<BR>18. How could DKO best improve information sharing within DOD and with DODs mission partners in accordance with the DOD Net-Centric Data and Services Strategies while maintaining information assurance?<BR>19.  DKO provides one of the core enterprise services of DISAs NCES program:  User Access.  As such, DKOs User Access is the requirement, and must fully integrate with and use the other services provided by NCES.  What special contract provisions, if any, are desired to assure reliable and cost-effective service to DOD end-users in this scenario?<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 708th Armament Systems Group, Eglin AFB FL, is seeking sources to continue the existing acquisition strategy for the follow on production of the FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) for the remaining quantity of 28,174 systems. If any potential offeror feels they can meet the requirements outlined below, they should deliver a Statement of Capabilities in accordance with Numbered Note 25 specifically defining their capabilities.<br />The JPF is a multifunction, multi-delay tail fuze system with hardened target capability for use in general purpose and penetrating unitary warheads. The JPF operates with a wide variety of guidance kits, high and low drag fins, and with all configurations of the DSU-33 proximity sensor to provide an airburst capability. When used with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), the JPF operating mode and other settings may be selected in flight from the cockpit through a serial RS-422 interface between the weapon and fuze. The objectives of JPF production lots are to fabricate a high quality JPF that is fully integrated and qualified for employment. The following delivery schedule must be met or exceeded; Contract Award - NLT 1st quarter FY09, first delivery of fully qualified production units - NLT May 2010. A total quantity of 28,174 systems is required with an estimated annual budget of $29.7M in FY09 through FY12.<br />Potential offerors would be required to provide a fully qualified JPF that is compatible with the Mark 80 series (MK-82, MK-83, MK-84) and penetrator warheads (BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-113, BLU-122). It must also be compatible for use in all JDAM variants, AGM-130, and GBU-10/12/15/16/24/27/28 weapon systems as well as in the basic "dumb" bomb configurations. In addition to weapons compatibility, the JPF must be qualified and certified on the following aircraft: B-1B, B-2A, B-52H, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22, A-10. The contractor must also have adequate resources to provide engineering and testing support for emerging aircraft integration requirements. The current budget only supports the production of FMU-152A/B JPF systems. As a result, the Government considers system maturity to be the top priority, and therefore, offerors must be prepared to begin full rate production by May 2010. The contractor must also have the capacity to produce at a rate of 1,800 systems per month for the duration. Full qualification and integration testing costs, including a First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) program, would be the total responsibility of the contractor. The contractor must provide shipping to CONUS locations and also provide adequate production, test and logistics (warranty) support. The contractor must meet the system specifications for both the FMU-152A/B and FZU-55A/B fuze bomb initiator. The system specifications for each may be obtained by contacting the Contract Specialist, Ms. Lisa Younghanse, at (850) 882-8787 ext. 3100. <br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government's intention to pay for information solicited at this time. Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to Ms. Lisa Younghanse, (850) 882-8787 ext 3100. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC><p>OFFADD: AFCA/ENN, 203 W. Losey St., Rm. 2100, Scott AFB IL 62225-5200<br />SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as commitment by the government. The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of government-off-the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf products that can meet the requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) Combat Infrastructure Transport System (CITS).
<p>The DESIRED END STATE is a network management system that would manage and control ITS network equipment from the Air Force (AF) enterprise level at the Integrated Network Operations Security Center (INOSC). This network management application must provide the following features and capabilities in a multi-vendor environment:<br />a) Software provides a "single pane of glass" for viewing essential info<br />b) Software only requires a single network operator<br />c) Software displays configuration changes and/or equipment failures<br />d) Software has one common training scenario for all interfaced vendors<br />e) Software displays multi-vendor updates<br />f) Software maintains a history of configuration changes<br />g) Software configures individual devices <br />h) Software aides in troubleshooting problems with individual devices<br />i) Software provides interoperability to the INOSC operations<br />j) Software provides setup capability of VPN, VLAN, etc. - higher level network configurations<br />k) Software provides server management - ITS applications (like 2GWLAN)<br />l) Software provides network mapping of multi-vendor devices<br />m) Software provides discovery of multi-vendor devices<br />n) Software facilitates policy compliance management</p>
<p>At a minimum the vendor RFI submissions should address the following questions/comments:<br />1. Does the proposed capability/concept rely on any proprietary standards? <br />2. Is the capability easy to deploy, maintain, and use?<br />3. What kind of training is available for the maintainers and how is it accomplished?<br />4. How does the proposed solution manage/support COOP? <br />5. What features, whether listed above or not are in development and will be available in future releases?<br />6. What ports and protocols does the proposed solution/concept use?<br />7. What measures/mechanisms are used to ensure data is accessible to authorized individuals/systems?<br />8. What other vendors are partnered with and support the proposed solution?</p>
<p>This network management application must be capable of interfacing with devices from multiple vendors. This tool must allow our network administrators to complete all needed management and maintenance tasks from a standard interface without having to directly access the command line of that specific device or open a second network management application designed for the specific brand of network devices. The network operator must be able to work from a single set of instructions/menus thus also enabling the school house to teach a single network operations platform. The system must come with COOP capabilities and network discovery tools that capture the multi-vendor environment.</p>
<p>Vendors responding to this RFI who currently can make products available to the Air Force are requested to provide descriptions of concepts within 15 days after the posting date of this notice. Potential vendors may express interest, make comments and ask questions via electronic mail or fax comments or questions to the Air Force Communications Agency, Network Integration and Design Branch at AFCA.ENND @scott.af.mil, FAX (618) 229-6779. (Note: confirm the fax number, this may be okay but I'm only familiar with the EN fax at 618-229-5544). Vendors that meet Air Force requirements will be asked to demonstrate, at no cost to the government, capabilities and provide software/concepts for Air Force testing/review. All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, email address and telephone number.<br />EMAILADD: AFCA.ENND@scott.af.mil<br />EMAILDESC: Air Force Communications Agency, ENND, Scott AFB IL</p>

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is the program manager for the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program. Under this program DSCP has awarded multiple contracts to various distributors to supply the Department of Defense and other Government medical treatment facilities (hospitals, clinics, etc.) with medical/surgical supplies. Because these contracts exceed $194,000, the provisions of the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) apply as specified in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 25.4 et seq. and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) 225.401 et seq. 

The TAA requires that Federal government procure only end items manufactured in the United States, Qualifying Countries and Designated Countries.  End items not manufactured in one of these categories are considered to be manufactured in non-designated countries.

Medical items manufactured in non-designated countries are prohibited from supply under the TAA, unless the DSCP seeks and is granted a National Interest Waiver (NIW) from the Director of Defense Procurement Acquisition and Policy. Therefore, the DSCP requests your response to this Request for Information (RFI).

The information obtained regarding country of origin for your products will be analyzed to determine whether or not DSCP will seek relief from the requirements of the TAA via a NIW.

Notice Type: Sources of Information Sought


Synopsis:


This is a Request for Information (RFI).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.   This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government.  The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research to determine an acquisition strategy for non-contract sales and metrics related to the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor Program.

Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is an agency of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  DLA provides supply support and logistics services to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and several federal agencies.  The Medical Supplier Operations, a Directorate of DSCP, is planning for a follow-on Medical Surgical Prime Vendor indefinite quantity, long-term contract.  The estimated solicitation issue date is on or around June 2009.  The intended contract base period is anticipated to be 2 years with 2  two year option periods, although this is subject to change depending on Market Research.  DSCPs Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program is seeking information to improve several features of its program design for contract and non-contract sales.   

The Medical Surgical Prime Vendor (Med Surg PV) Program has established three TRICARE Global regions (North, South, and West) that combine to provide routine ordering capability throughout the world.  Prime Vendor (PV) is the primary distribution channel (single distributor) for procurement and delivery of a full range of commercial medical/surgical supplies to a group of Medical Treatment Facilities in the geographical regions.  Medical Treatment Facilities order directly through the Prime Vendor with next day delivery.  Each PV provides all medical surgical products for which it has been authorized as a distributor under a designated contracting instrument as authorized by DSCP Medical.  Designated contracting instruments include, but are not limited to, a Distribution and Pricing Agreements (DAPAs) and the Alternate Commercial Product Ordering Program (ACPOP).  All items are brand name specific or generic commercial products that are identified by the manufacturers item descriptions and part number and conform to the manufacturers commercial specifications.  

The Alternate Commercial Product Ordering Program (ACPOP) was provided as an opportunity for customers to have access to PV inventory available to commercial customers, but not currently available through a DAPA.  Under ACPOP, our customers can order from an electronic catalog of items managed by the PVs.  ACPOP is an adaptation of a technique that is broadly used in the commercial sector and usually referred to as non-contract sales.  DSCP intends to redesign its ACPOP program for the follow-on contract.  One of the goals of this re-design is to obtain prices of items prior to the customer ordering through ACPOP so that all prices can be determined Fair and Reasonable by the Government.  We are soliciting industry ideas for this (new/different) mechanism.

DSCP is required to have quantitative metrics to evaluate contractor performance.  Therefore, the Government is also seeking to re-design one or some of the performance metrics for the follow-on contract.  One measure currently utilized under the current contract is the fill rate.  This measure only allows for inclusion of items defined as usage items by the customer.  The fill rate metric is calculated by number of lines filled divided by number of lines ordered.  DSCP is seeking ideas, recommendations, and other metrics based on commercial practices used for evaluating contractor performance. 

Your responses are requested by the close of business on July 07, 2008 and may be sent via mail or email.  If email is your preferred source of transmission, we recommend that you look for a confirmation within 48 hours of submission by the point of contact provided below.  Any responses received after this date may not be reviewed or considered in our contract formation process for the follow-on Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract.

Please submit your responses to Ms. Raeshon Sykes, Contracting Officer, at

<a href="mailto:Joseph.Saunders@netl.doe.gov">Donald Hafer, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy TechnologyLaboratory(NETL), is conducting a Market Survey to identify small businesses, smalldisadvantaged businesses and 8(a) certified businesses capable of providingon-site Project Execution and Integration Support for NETL.THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for information and planning purposes andis not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not asolicitation announcement for proposals and NO CONTRACT will be awardedfrom this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costsassociatedwith providing information in response to this announcement or anyfollow-upinformation requests.  The information gathered from this sources soughtnoticewill be utilized in the Government's determination on contract and businesstype utilized in the solicitation.The magnitude of this effort is expected to be $18,000,000 or more peryear.The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for thiseffort is 54330 with a size standard of $4.5 million.  The NAICS isprovidedfor use by businesses in determining their appropriate business size inresponse to this sources sought notice.  For further information onbusinesssize definitions please refer to the Small Business Administration's websiteathttp://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html.The National Energy Technology Laboratory is owned and operated by the U.S.Department of Energy (DOE). As the only DOE national laboratory dedicatedspecifically to fossil energy research, NETLs efforts are focused onresolvingthe environmental, supply, and reliability constraints of producing andusingAmericas fossil fuel resources.  NETL is a single organization supportedbyfacilities in Albany, OR; Fairbanks, AK; Morgantown, WV; Pittsburgh, PA;andTulsa, OK. The laboratorys activities are primarily funded through DOEsOffice of Fossil Energy, but NETL also conducts work for other DOE officesandfederal agencies. Significant work is sponsored by the DOE Office of EnergyEfficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the Office of ElectricityDeliveryand Energy Reliability (OE).To accomplish the laboratorys mission, NETL draws on 1,200 federal andsupport-contractor employees to implement and manage a broad spectrum ofresearch programs; approximately half are Federal employees and half aresitesupport contractors. NETL conducts more than 1,800 onsite and contractedactivities in the United States and in more than 40 foreign countries.Additional information about NETL can be attained at our websitewww.netl.doe.gov.Anticipated work assignments for this service contract would supportactivitiesprimarily at the Morgantown and Pittsburgh sites, requiring on-sitepresence atboth sites and potential travel to other locations.    This work wouldfocus onthe execution of projects and integration with program initiatives. Programinitiatives are national in scope and emphasize partnerships with privateindustry, academia, state governments, and other governmental stakeholderstocreate commercially-viable technological solutions to national energy andenvironmental problems.  This emphasis on partnering with externalorganizations requires that NETL maintain a dedicated, trained staff totechnically and administratively solicit, award, monitor contracts andfinancial assistance agreements.  As a result, NETL is effectivelyorganized toprovide technical management services to FE, EERE, OE and other federalagencies.The work requires the application of a mix of technical expertise inscientificand engineering disciplines appropriate for the range of projects for eachprogram area, project management expertise to enhance the success ofproject-related activities, and expertise to effectively manageproject-specific information/data.  The following table delineates thecurrentrange of program areas, under which NETLs more than 1,500 externalprojectsmay be categorized.NETL Technology Development Program AreasProgram AreaTechnology Development Subprogram - Responsible Project Management DivisionCoal and Power SystemsClean Coal Power Initiative (Major Demonstrations) - Major ProjectsCarbon Sequestration - Environment & ClimateEnvironmental and Water Resources - Environment & ClimateDistributed Generation (Fuel Cells) - Power SystemsAdvanced Turbines - Power SystemsIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle - Gasification & FuelsAdvanced Combustion Systems - Gasification & FuelsAdvanced Research (Crosscutting) - Gasification & FuelsCoal Fuels and Hydrogen - Gasification & FuelsFutureGen - Advanced Energy InitiativesNatural Gas Supply, Oil Supply and Environmental SolutionsOil Exploration and Production - Natural Gas & Oil Project ManagementEffective Environmental Protections - Natural Gas & Oil Project ManagementReservoir Life Extension/Management - Natural Gas & Oil Project ManagementNatural Gas Exploration and Production - Natural Gas & Oil ProjectManagementMethane Hydrates - Natural Gas & Oil Project ManagementEnergy Efficiency and Renewable EnergyBuildings Technology - Buildings & Industrial TechnologiesFederal Energy Management Program - Buildings & Industrial TechnologiesIndustrial Technologies - Buildings & Industrial TechnologiesVehicle Technologies - Power & Vehicles TechnologiesWeatherization and Intergovernmental Program - Intergovernmental Projects &OutreachElectricity Delivery and Energy ReliabilityTransmission and Distribution R&D - Technical & Project ManagementPlanning, Siting and Analysis - Technical & Project ManagementInfrastructure, Security and Energy Restoration - Technical & ProjectManagementWork performed under the subsequent acquisition is to support projectexecutionand integration functions of NETL project management divisions andfunctionalteams responsible for the oversight of project activities conducted byorganizations external to NETL.  Anticipated work is in support of: 1.Procurement planning and execution, 2. Project control, oversight, andassistance, 3. Validation assessments and studies, including considerationoftechnical, cost/schedule, risk and environmental factors, 4. Project andprogram peer reviews, 5.

Specifically discuss the assurance that resources are available tomeet payroll, subcontracting, and material obligations at this magnitude.Asindicated by the NAICS code and the projected magnitude listed above, asmallbusiness awarded this contract would likely graduate from the smallbusinessprogram and as such NETL desires to ensure that this transition issuccessful.Please do not provide financial statements as part of your response; itshouldbe limited to a discussion of the rationale.4. Current or planned technical, management, project, and administrativeresources including summary of credentials of current key personnel (withallapplicable certifications, licenses, degrees and relevant publicationstitles)to effectively meet diverse customer needs for a broad range of research,development, demonstration, and deployment projects.5.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy TechnologyLaboratory(NETL), is conducting a Market Survey to identify interested partiescapable ofproviding Research and Engineering Services for NETL.THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for information and planning purposes andisnot to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not asolicitation announcement for proposals and NO CONTRACT will be awardedfromthis announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associatedwithproviding information in response to this announcement or any follow-upinformation requests. The information gathered from this sources soughtnoticewill be utilized in the Government's determination on contract and businesstype utilized in the solicitation.The magnitude of this effort is expected to be $55,000,000 or more peryear.The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is provided foruseby businesses in determining their appropriate business size in response tothis sources sought notice.  The NAICS code for this effort is 541712 withasize standard of 500 employees. For business size definitions please refertothe Small Business Administration's web site at:http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.htmlNETL, through its Office of Research and Development (ORD) performs onsiteresearch and development (R&D) in support of DOEs Office of Fossil Energy,other DOE Offices, other federal agencies and private entities.  NETLsonsiteR&D solves problems that are barriers to the deployment of emerging powersystem, fuels, environmental and waste management technologies.NETLs onsite R&D efforts utilize state-of-the-art capabilities andfacilitiesat sites in   Morgantown, WV, Pittsburgh, PA and; Albany, OR.  Toaccomplishthe laboratorys mission, NETL draws on 1,200 federal andsupport-contractoremployees to implement and manage a broad spectrum of research programs;approximately half are Federal employees and half are site supportcontractors.NETLs current onsite research staff includes approximately 200 Federalscientists and engineers, personnel from private industry, and academicresearch fellows and associates at the faculty, postdoctoral, graduate, andundergraduate levels.  In addition to on-site research, NETLs supportsextramural R&D through financial assistance, contracts, interagencyagreements,and other mechanisms.Work performed under the planned acquisition will focus on high riskscienceand engineering research capable of achieving break-through energysolutions towiden the nations economic and energy options.  The contractor willconceptualize, design, construct, maintain and operate state of the artprocesses at NETL.  The goal of this effort is to support and further ORDsbasic science and applied engineering research and technology development.This support shall take the form of collaborative, interdisciplinaryscientificand engineering research projects, targeted toward the generation offundamental and basic science information.Within ORD, research project ideas are conceived and work plans aredevelopedwithin Focus Areas.  Focus Areas are groups of related fields ofexperience,activity, or knowledge.  Focus Areas may change over time in response tosignificant shifts in energy research.  Currently, there are four ORD FocusAreas:Computational and Basic Sciences - The Computational and Basic SciencesFocusArea seeks to integrate physical and chemical experimental research withcomputational sciences as the preferred method for understanding anddevelopingtechnologies, advanced materials, and multi-scale energy systems rangingfromthe molecular-scale to device-scale to plant-scale. The focus area hasdeveloped a strategy to assemble computational models from ab initio(atomicand molecular) through device-scale, and to integrate the device-scalemodelsinto virtual plant simulations. In concert with this modeling work,experimental R&D is conducted in selected program areas in close, ofteniterative, collaboration with the computational efforts.  The focus areasupports activities in coal power systems, natural gas and oiltechnologies,and also strives to meet national energy security goals.  The long-termobjective of the focus area is to develop science-based and validatedcomputational tools to simulate and facilitate the development of clean,highlyefficient energy systems of the future.Energy System Dynamics  The Energy System Dynamics Focus Area seeks toconceive, analyze, and develop pre-commercial energy technology thatminimizesthe environmental impact of fossil fuel use and that maximizes reliable useofdomestic energy sources and infrastructure. The focus area primarilyaddressesdevices that would be found in plant, such as turbines and fuel cellhybrids,fuel cells, fuel processors for fuel cells, gasification, carbon dioxidecapture for pulverized coal and for integrated gasification combined cycle(IGCC) systems, reciprocating engines, and sensor/control methods for alltheseenergy systems. This focus area is a recognized source of expertise andresearch leading to commercially viable technology that improvesfossil-fuel-based energy systems. The focus area supports research anddevelopment in coal power systems, and supports the Presidents GlobalClimateChange Initiative.  Research is centered around investigation and testingofnew energy system concept and technologies.Geological and Environmental Systems - The Geological and EnvironmentalSystemsFocus Area seeks to assess the capacity, suitability, and permanence ofpotential carbon sequestration reservoirs, to assess the ability ofunconventional reservoirs to produce gas and oil and assist in thatproduction,to improve environmental performance of existing power plants, and to berecognized for performing sound science, achieving excellence, and meetinggoals.  The scope of the focus area includes geological sequestration;ensurepermanent carbon sequestering; resources assessment; production modeling;development of unconventional gas and oil resources; fate of air toxicssuch asmercury; byproduct utilization; and water issues related to existingcoal-fueled electric power plants. Sequestration simulation and field workexpertise provides a valuable internal capability for NETL in assessingexternal activities. The focus area is working closely with currentsequestration field-testing activities and is involved in collaborativeactivities with the regional sequestration partnerships developed by DOE.Thefocus area directly supports the Presidents Global Climate ChangeInitiative,carbon sequestration technologies, natural gas and oil technologies, andcleanpower generation.  The long-range objective of the focus area is to conductresearch in carbon sequestration, natural gas and oil, and environmentalresearch.Materials Science  The Materials Science Focus Area specializes in lifecycleresearch starting with the formulation, characterization, and melting ofmostmetals, alloys, and ceramics; casting and fabrication; prototypedevelopment;and the recycling and remediation of waste streams associated with theseprocesses. Advanced materials and processes are vital to higher performanceandmore economic fossil energy systems and other 21st century power and fuelsproduction plants.  This focus area addresses the need for new materialsthatcan withstand higher temperatures and corrosive environments of advancedpowergeneration technologies such as coal gasifiers, turbines, combustors, andfuelcells.Two other groups, Hydrates, and Ultra Deep / Unconventional Gas and Oil,function similarly to Focus Areas.Hydrates  The Hydrates area is focused on the production and utilizationofhydrates.  This will include understanding the role hydrates play in globalprocesses such as climate and the carbon cycle; investigating the impact ofhydrates on seafloor stability and deep-sea life; developing the tools andknowledge that will ensure the safety of drilling and producing deep-wateroiland gas resources located below marine hydrate deposits; and developing theknowledge and technology base to allow commercial production of methanefromdomestic hydrate deposits by the year 2015.  Both modeling and experimentalwork will be important in this effort.  A further aspect of this workeffortwill be to elucidate the behavior of methane hydrates in nature in responsetonatural and induced phenomena.Ultra Deep and Unconventional Gas and Oil  The Ultra Deep andUnconventionalGas and Oil area has been formulated in association with the EPACT Section999research and development effort.  The goal of the program is to identifyandremove technological barriers to expanded domestic oil and gas resourceutilization.  In addition to research results, the program will broaden anddevelop ORD capabilities and provide quality educational opportunities forstudents to train in this key technical area.  The program will coordinateclosely with the external Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America(RPSEA) consortium to ensure non-duplication of research efforts.  Researchefforts will be focused around drilling under extreme conditions;environmentalimpacts of oil and natural gas development; enhanced and unconventional oilrecovery; and resource assessment.Work performed under the subsequent acquisition will focus on two areas; 1)High risk science and engineering research that is capable of achievingbreak-through energy solutions to widen the nations economic and energyoptions, and 2) The development, implementation and maintenance of the R&Dinfrastructure components relevant to the physical laboratory space andutilities necessary to carry out the research.  The breadth of researchperformed will span from applied fundamental science and engineeringresearchthrough technology development and demonstrations.  Support staff, throughthisacquisition, will be afforded the opportunity to conceptualize, design,construct, maintain and operate state of the art processes and facilitieson-site at NETL that will produce high level results and stimulate a worldclass collaborative effort with the U.S. Department of Energy.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy TechnologyLaboratory(NETL), is conducting a Market Survey to identify businesses capable ofproviding on-site Energy Sector Planning & Analysis Services for NETL.THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for information and planning purposes andis not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not asolicitation announcement for proposals and NO CONTRACT will be awardedfrom this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costsassociatedwith providing information in response to this announcement or anyfollow-upinformation requests.  The information gathered from this sources soughtnoticewill be utilized in the Government's determination on contract and businesstype utilized in the solicitation.The magnitude of this effort is expected to be $18,000,000 or more peryear.The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for thiseffort is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The NAICS isprovidedfor use by businesses in determining their appropriate business size inresponse to this sources sought notice.  For further information onbusinesssize definitions please refer to the Small Business Administration's websiteathttp://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html.The National Energy Technology Laboratory is owned and operated by the U.S.Department of Energy (DOE). As the only DOE national laboratory dedicatedspecifically to fossil energy research, NETLs efforts are focused onresolvingthe environmental, supply, and reliability constraints of producing andusingAmericas fossil fuel resources.  NETL is a single organization supportedbyfacilities in Albany, OR; Fairbanks, AK; Morgantown, WV; Pittsburgh, PA;andTulsa, OK. The laboratorys activities are primarily funded through DOEsOffice of Fossil Energy, but NETL also conducts work for other DOE officesandfederal agencies. Significant work is sponsored by the DOE Office of EnergyEfficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the Office of ElectricityDeliveryand Energy Reliability (OE).To accomplish the laboratorys mission, NETL draws on 1,200 federal andsupport-contractor employees to implement and manage a broad spectrum ofresearch programs; approximately half are Federal employees and half aresitesupport contractors. NETL conducts more than 1,800 onsite and contractedactivities in the United States and in more than 40 foreign countries.Additional information about NETL can be attained at our websitewww.netl.doe.gov.Anticipated work assignments for this service contract would supportactivitiesprimarily at the Morgantown and Pittsburgh sites, requiring on-sitepresence atboth sites and potential travel to other locations.    This work wouldsupportplanning and analysis efforts of the sponsoring offices responsible forenergypolicy formulation, strategic planning, and analysis studies forenergy-sectorissues of national scope.

<SUBJECT>Screening for the Identification, Treatment and Prevention of Epilepsy and Neuroprotectants as Countermeasures to Chemical Threats
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-08-04

<CONTACT>Helene C Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email hb106s@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a two-year extension of the Anticonvulsant Screening Program's (ASP) contract with University of Utah in order to coincide with the expiration of the second component of the contract which was incorporated into the CounterAct Program funded by non-NIH sources to the same site. The purpose of the extension is to provide continued screening services while establishing a coincident expiration of the two screening components. Both screening components, which require significant resources in terms of personnel, facilities and materials requires extensive coordination of scientific data evaluation and administrative management. Virtually all compounds being submitted for evaluation within the CounterACT component are also screened in the ASP program. Both components focus on cessation of seizures although different types. It is essential from both a resource and operational management perspective to have both components run concurrent to each other. Negotiating an extension of the current contract for two years will provide concurrent evaluation and testing paradigms and will allow for a coincident contract expiration date. This action will significantly contribute to management efficiencies as well as streamlining program evaluation and review of solicitations for projected future renewals of two efforts.
<p>The primary goal of the ASP's contract is to evaluate novel compounds intended primarily as therapeutic interventions as anticonvulsants, neuroprotectants and for treatment of neuropathic pain. The ASP conducts extensive testing to facilitate drug discovery and translational activities aimed at identifying, optimizing and translating such discoveries into therapeutics for affected patients. Active compounds are identified and tested through a series of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluations (both in vivo and in vitro tests) that help define anticonvulsant or related disease profiles of candidate compounds. Test parameters include but are not limited to:</p>
<p><br />Baseline assessments of anti-seizure activity, neurotoxicity, effects on hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes, pharmacodynamic interactions, brain slice survival rates and chronic EEG monitoring. These efforts have been carried out under the contract mechanism since 1975 with the University of Utah. Approximately 750 compounds are evaluated annually for anticonvulsant and related activities. Overall testing requirements include the following: 1) Anticonvulsant Identification: evaluation of anticonvulsant activity and associated neurotoxicity in mice, following intraperitoneal administration using the 6 Hz induced focal seizures. 2) Compounds displaying significant activity may be further evaluated with subsequent quantitation using the supramaximal electroshock seizure pattern test (MES), the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (sc Met) threshold test and the rotorod test. Those compounds possessing significant anticonvulsant activity in mice shall also be evaluated in rats using similar models but via different routes of administration. Both activity and toxicity shall be quantitated at previously determined time of peak effects. 3) Pharmacologic Differentiation -- Anticonvulsant profiles are developed wherein the efficacy will be compared with that of the prototype drugs. As part of this process, the efficacy is quantitated using seizures induced by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Anticonvulsant profiles of candidate anticonvulsant compounds are also developed in rats by the gammabutrylactone (GBL) spike-wave model of absence and by the rapid hippocampal-kindling model of complex partial seizures. Candidate substances are evaluated for their ability to block the expression of kindled seizures in the rapid hippocampal kindling model. A limited number shall additionally be tested the ability to block the acquisition of kindled seizures induced by rapid hippocampal stimulation. Profiles for selected test substances will include a genetically susceptible model of reflex epilepsy. 4) Proconvulsant Potential -The endpoint being length of time taken for evidence of seizure activity following the infusion of pentylenetetrazol into the tail vein of mice. 5) Mechanism of Action -- Studies to elucidate anticonvulsant mechanism(s) of action shall be conducted on a limited number of test substances. These include the use of whole cell voltage-clamp recordings from cortical neurons in primary culture to characterize possible interactions with GABA and glutamate receptors. 6) Drug Interaction Studies - The metabolic potential for drug-drug interactions are determined using human liver microsomes. The potential to inhibit a battery of the major P-450 human liver isozymes are determined along with comparative assessment of the standard available anticonvulsants. 7) Lamotrigine Resistant Kindled Rat Test -. Animals will be kindled according to the procedure described by Postma et al. (2000) with seizures scored according to a Racine Scale (Racine, 1972). Seizure scores and afterdischarge durations will be recorded for each animal. 8) AED Modulation of Axonal Neurotransmission - This will be assessed via two tests: Partial Ligation of the Sciatic Nerve and the Formalin Test: Used to determine efficacy of an investigational AED against the acute and chronic hyper-responsive neuronal discharges following activation of peripheral nerve fibers. Slice electrophysiology studies and 24 hour EEG recordings are performed on a select number of candidates. Comprehensive summary are prepared for the best candidates (approximately 12 per yr.)</p>
<p>During the past 32 years, the University of Utah has been able to successfully adopt specialized techniques, methods of evaluation, model development and accumulation of extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles for all the current therapeutic agents and most new investigational drugs. This accumulation of data and experiences is the basis by which all new test compounds are pharmacologically compared. The NINDS believes that the University of Utah is the only known source for performing these comprehensive evaluations by virtue of their experience, demonstrated expertise, availability of required staff, laboratory and animal facilities and requisite trained personnel and resources. NINDS' requirement for consistency and compatibility of data derived from these screening procedures is paramount to the success of this program.</p>
<p>Inability to produce compatible evaluation results to our existing data base would lead to delays in screening new compounds and incurrence of duplicate costs, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government and would disrupt the continuity of this work. Organizations that believe they have the qualifications and capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of staffing, facilities, and methodologies currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement. An organization must have an ongoing program with available staff with substantial experience in conducting the required tests, equipment, space and infrastructure in place to carry out the work described above. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This is not a formal solicitation or an announcement that a Request for Proposals (RFP) is available. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.</p>

<RESPDATE>070308
<CONTACT>Francis Fisher, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-5904, Fax 301-757-5955, Email francis.fisher@navy.mil - Vicki Fuhrmann, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-5924, Email vicki.fuhrmann@navy.mil
<DESC>This is market research being conducted by the Navy Aerial Target and Decoy Systems Program Office (PMA-208) of the Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons [PEO (U&W)] to support ongoing acquisition planning efforts.

The United States Navy has a requirement for a cost effective aerial target system to represent Subsonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Threats and air platforms.  This Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) System will be used to support developmental and operational testing of naval combat systems while providing services in support of advanced fleet training.  

The SSAT will be a recoverable aerial target vehicle capable of realistically representing enemy threats that operate in the subsonic regime.  The SSAT will be launch capable from ashore, at sea or by air and will be remotely controlled utilizing the System for Navy Target Control (SNTC).  

Based on previous market research, the Navy has identified a number of manufacturers with existing subsonic target systems that could be modified to achieve SSAT performance requirements.  The Navy is considering making a competitive solicitation for the limited development and refinement of an existing target system to achieve Navy requirements to facilitate follow-on production.  This late-stage System Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort is envisioned to commence in the FY-09 timeframe and is anticipated to be 12-24 months in duration.  Follow-on production is desired in FY-11.  Production is currently envisioned to cover a fifteen year period at a rate of approximately 45 vehicles a year.

To support the development of the Navys acquisition approach, potential contractors are requested to submit a white paper, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, that covers:

-	The current nondevelopmental base target vehicle with a listing of current capabilities compared to the performance requirements identified in Table 1 of the draft Performance Specification, PMA208-08001/R, for the Navy Model Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) System and End Items.
-	The major technical endeavors anticipated to achieve the threshold requirements identified in Table 1 of the draft Performance Specification, PMA208-08001/R,  for the Navy Model Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) System and End Items.
-	Contractor comments on the viability (scope and schedule) of the Governments proposed Contractor and combined Government/Contractor system test and evaluation efforts in the draft Statement of Work.
-	Based on the factors listed above, also provide a ROM schedule & cost estimate of the envisioned development effort only.

Copies of the SSAT technical documentation, including the draft Performance Specification, draft Statement of Work (SOW), draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and other draft documents may be obtained by contacting Mr. Frank Fisher at email francis.fisher@navy.mil  or at telephone number (301) 757-5904.  

Industry comments and feedback to this request will be analyzed, considered, and used in the development of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  All material provided will be treated as proprietary.  Multiple White Papers describing different possible solutions are acceptable.  The fifteen page limit is per White Paper.  Request white papers be provided to the point of contact identified below by 3 July 2008.

PMA-208 intends to conduct an Industry Day in the September 2008 timeframe to provide additional information.  The Industry Day announcement is planned to be posted on FEDBIZOPS by the end of June 2008.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED. THIS RFI IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE AN RFP OR AWARD A CONTRACT.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Department of Homeland Security is performing market research.

The Department of Homeland Security has a possible future requirement for express package audit and recovery services.  

BACKGROUND

Congress has issued legislation to address the identification, prevention, and recovery of improper payments. Public Law No. 107-300, the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), enacted in November 2002, requires the heads of federal agencies to annually: 1) identify programs and activities susceptible to improper payments; 2) estimate the annual amount of improper payments and submit that estimate to Congress; and 3) for improper payments that exceed 2.5% of program payments and $10 million annually, the agency must report the actions it is taking to reduce improper payments, including a discussion of the causes.  DHS has identified a potential opportunity for additional cost savings for the Department through auditing of any shipment that is not delivered as promised by the respective shipping company. The contracts between DHS and its express package vendors stipulate that these must provide DHS a refund when a shipment is not delivered as agreed. For this reason DHS will begin tracking shipments for which the Department has been charged incorrectly. Public Law No. 107-107, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2002 (NDAA), Subchapter VI Recovery Audits, requires all agencies that enter into contracts with an annual total value in excess of $500 million to carry out a cost-effective program to identify errors and recover amounts erroneously paid.

SERVICES

DHS is exploring the retrieval of invoiced refunds to support efficient use of human capital and fiscal resources. An audit and recovery vendor would provide DHS with economies of scale not only to verify that these packages were not delivered in the agreed upon timeframe but also to have the resources and technology to retrieve the refunds due to the Department.

Firms should submit a detailed response that describes its capabilities, approach and any unique qualifications it possesses that could benefit DHS.  Our goal is to identify vendors that are able to best meet the criteria defined below.  The vendor response should address the following areas:

	Unique qualifications and background.  

	Do you have the ability to audit shipments on the following criteria:  late delivery, no proof delivery, incorrect rate, manifested not shipped, damaged and others?

	Are there shipping volume minimum/limits?

	What reports are available to customers?  Are these reports online?

	How are overcharged shipments identified?

	How often area refunds processed?

	Can refund checks be obtained?

	For invoice credits, how are end of year refunds handled?

	Is flexible price structure available?

	Provide a list of current/past Federal clients including POC name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

	What type of security clearance is required for your companys data personnel?

	How does your company identify shipments that are eligible for a refund?  By viewing vendor reports or by tracking shipment numbers from the point of generation?

	What % of the total refund amount will your company charge as payment?  Billed monthly after payment is received?


The applicable NAICS Code is 541614 with a size standard of $6.5 million. In the capability statements contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concerns.  Responses to the sources sought synopsis shall be limited to 20 pages or less and should be submitted to Johnnie Lewis-Banks and Victoria Short, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations, Departmental Operations Acquisition Division, Room 3051, 245 Murray Lane, S.W., Building 410, Washington, D.C. 20528 or Johnnie.Lewis-Banks@dhs.gov and Victoria.Short@dhs.gov no later than 10 business days from the date of posting.

<DESC>Description<BR><BR>This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This market survey will be used to provide information on a flashlight evaluation effort under the Family of Flashlights (FoF) Program and introduce a revised Approved Family of Flashlight List (AFFL).  Once the revised AFFL is released, all candidates on the pre-existing AFFL will no longer be valid.  All interested vendors, including those on the current AFFL, must submit flashlights for revised AFFL testing.  The U.S. Army Product Manager, Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) is currently seeking qualified sources to provide  commercially available flashlights  that satisfy the Buy American Act, Sec. 25.101, (a) (1), and (2), and to Sec. 25.103. All submissions shall be provided by the vendor at no cost or obligation to the Government.Any information collected shall not be disclosed outside the Government. Test data for all submitted items will only be provided to the designated Vendor.  Interested parties should provide the following to the points of contact by 30 June 2008: product literature, product specification, and cost information (both GSA and MSRP prices). All products will be tested as submitted. All factors, to include cost, will be considered for inclusion on the AFFL using a systematic approach.  The AFFL will consist of three categories of flashlights: 1) Hands Free Helmet Light (HFHL), 2) Tactical Handheld Light (THL), and 3) Basic White Lights (BWL) (non aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged). Limit 3 items for each category per company.  <BR><BR>Selection Process<BR><BR>The selection process for the AFFL will use a down-select process. This process will consist of 3 Phases: Phase I  Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing, Phase II  Technical Testing, and Phase III  User Evaluation. A scoring system will be used for Phase II and III.  No external lab testing conducted outside of the Army for any phases of testing will be acceptable.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to supply preservative (acid solution) used in water sampling programs by the Water Resources Discipline (WRD) District and Field Office to preserve environmental water samples for analysis, as per the parts per billion (PPB) protocol mandated by the Headquarters USGS Office of Water quality (OWQ) in Reston VA.  The supplies that are used by WRD personnel for collecting and processing water-quality samples undergo rigorous quality-assurance testing prior to being selected for use and/or they are very specific to certain pieces of equipment being used in the field (e.g. a specific filter required for a certain chemical constituent or a Petri dish size to fit field incubators).  QA testing is then routinely done on each new lot of many of the supply items as they are received from the vendor to assure that quality is being maintained.  Whenever there is change to a new vendor or a new type of supply or equipment, the initial quality-assurance testing, which is often extensive, must be repeated to assure that no changes in the long-term data record occur and that data quality is maintained.  These requirements are mandated by the National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) National Field Supply Services (NFSS) Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from EP Scientific Products, Miami, OK and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item/services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, request for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Iowa Department of Natural Resources, to develop a Local Resolution NHD using a LIDAR Derived 1-meter DEM, the National Wetland Inventory and the High Resolution NHD.
This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for the development of a Local Resolution NHD data in Iowa.  USGS intends to partner with Iowa Department of Natural Resources to carry out a pilot project that will develop a process, define, and determine the level of effort required to create a Local Resolution NHD.  The results of this project will document a process to use USGS High Resolution NHD and local data to develop Local Resolution NHD for the state.
The state of Iowa has nearly completed a 1:12,000-scale National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) hydrography data set for the state.  The state is currently having state-wide LIDAR data collected through a partnership with the USGS.  Iowa Department of Natural Resources proposes to investigate the feasibility of developing a Local Resolution NHD using a LIDAR derived one-meter DEM, the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) and the High Resolution NHD.   Iowa Department of Natural Resources will process ten, 12-digit Hydrologic Units distributed around the state, in different landform regions, to determine the potential cost of developing Local Resolution NHD for the whole state (~1700 12-digit Hydrologic Units).  
No other sources were known to possess the unique and essential qualifications based on my experience and working relationship with Iowa Department of Natural Resources.  They have developed and maintained the NWI data set and have contracted for the LIDAR data from which they will derive a one-meter DEM used to create the Local Resolution NHD.   Iowa Department of Natural Resources has all of the required data sources and knowledge of working with this data to accomplish the desired task.
Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541360 which is $4.5 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

<CONTACT>Mark J Kanuck, Procurement Analyst  , Phone 813-826-7336, Fax 813-826-7504, Email mark.kanuck@socom.mil - Marc L. Huizinga, Contracting Specialist, Phone 813-826-6526, Email marc.huizinga@socom.mil
<DESC>USSOCOM is seeking sources with the demonstrated capability to engineer connectivity for a Mobile Tactical Network (MTN) among high bandwidth (2-5 Mbps) Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) to provide multiple real-time video streams and Position Location Information (PLI) to low echelon (company and below) mounted and dismounted users.  The MTN shall consist of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) validated routing protocols to connect the MANETs.  The threshold capability is to rapidly integrate two Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) standalone MANETs and commercially available satellite systems (e.g., InMarSat, BGAN, Ku) into a seamless network using Cisco network equipment.  The objective capability is to create the framework for a heterogeneous network that can automatically route across multiple networks/MANETs to allow seamless transition of information between the various endpoint terminals at any location on the MTN (including unicast, broadcast, and especially multicast traffic).

Each MANET may use different encryption schemes and routing protocols from the other MANETs on the MTN, but share a common physical connection via the Cisco router(s).  The MTN must be fully transportable and reconfigurable (form and fit) to allow permanent installation into ground and air mobility platforms.  The network architecture must be expandable to allow for future growth and/or lifecycle replacement of standalone MANETs to eliminate reliance upon any single MANET or technology.  The primary data being transported is Full Motion Video (FMV) with GFE encoders and decoders that consume approximately 300Kbps per video stream (including overhead).  The MTN should be designed as a multicast-centric environment (due to the high proportion of FMV) to reduce bandwidth saturation.

The first GFE MANET can be described as a Line-Of-Sight (LOS) backbone for IP addressable ground mobility platforms (e.g., Stryker) and tactical air mobility platforms (e.g., UH-60 and C-130) that provides a high-power, IP addressable long-distance network.  The second GFE MANET consists of smaller, battery-powered IP addressable components that are designed to be carried or worn by dismounted soldiers (typically handheld devices).  The entire MTN (both mounted and dismounted) is intended to be 75 nodes (threshold) and 150 nodes (objective) which operate in the same geographic location.  

This is primarily a technical integration.  The Government requests sources that are capable of providing the network architecture, network engineering, quantifiable tradeoffs, test cases, and test execution that prove a successful integration of the various MANETs within the MTN.  The Government does not desire responses or marketing which propose the replacement of existing MANETs, but rather those solutions which focus on the ability to join disparate GFE networks by using COTS equipment.  Responses may include the use of ancillary network equipment that is specifically intended to provide the desired connectivity, network management, and network monitoring functions. 

Demonstrated capability to perform the work described (such as tangible examples, experience, or past performance) are more desirable than novel approaches, although both will be given due consideration.  No format for the response is specified and no questions will be answered.  Please limit the technical approach to ten (10) pages and the entire submission (including all supporting information) shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.  Only electronic submissions in Adobe Acrobat 7.0 (or higher) or Microsoft Word (97-2003) will be accepted (no hard copies).  Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.

<a href="mailto:Cheryl.Weidner@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to issue a sole source procurement toSurgRx, Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This procurement is to obtain the EnSeal RF Generator Vessel Sealers which can be used for laparoscopic surgeries, nephrectomies, and living donor nephrectomies.  The EnSeal provides the surgeon a 5mm size instrument which will guarantee hemostasis (sealing) up to 7mm and can seal within 3-6 seconds.  This device provides maximum compression the full cut length up to 3x higher @ 7000 lbs. and only needs 180 volts to melt the collagen into elastin within the vessel walls.  The seal withstands up to 5x systolic BP on a 7mm vessel.  The EnSeal has less than 1mm thermal spread, controls energy deposition using radiofrequency energy and has a cooling off feature causing the generator to shut down after 100C.  The sharp dissection technology allows for the cut length to go to 17mm on an 18mm bite with two ways to cut the tissue.  A safety lock that allows only sealing, and after the tissue is denatured, the surgeon can unlock the device to move forward or the device can be set to simultaneously seal and cut.  The EnSeal handle offers 4 plus ways to hold the device which complements all different sized hands.  This same device can be either hand activated or activated by a foot pedal.  It is a multi-functional tool and can be used as a blunt dissector, a bipolar clamp to seal, a cutter, a seal/cut and it will cauterize a bleed.  It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this equipment to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to publicize the Governments intent to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin, Valley Forge, PA.  This sole source contract will be for modification of the current design to reflect weaponization (see Para. 3 below), fabrication, delivery, and flight test support of a hypersonic payload delivery vehicle.  The requested vehicle will be manufactured in accordance with the Hypersonic Test Vehicle (HTV-2) design developed for the FALCON program by Lockheed Martin.  SMC/XR requires that the payload delivery vehicle share the aerodynamics, thermal protection, avionics, and structural design developed by Lockheed Martin under the FALCON program so the first two flights under the FALCON program can be used to qualify the payload delivery vehicles structural design specifications, avionics, and flight software. The HTV-2 is under final assembly and scheduled to fly twice in 2009. SMC/XR requires a third vehicle be procured by SMC/XR and be ready for a 2010 flight demonstration.  

Any potential solutions other than HTV-2 must be fully flight qualified by 2009 by the contractor in order to satisfy the requirement.

The scope of the contract includes the redesign of the interior structural bulkheads to accommodate an 800 to 1000 lb payload, fabrication and delivery of the flight vehicle (including all necessary structural components, special tooling, software and avionics), and flight test support (including integration support at the launch facility, range support for the flight test, and data analysis associated with flight test performance).

<DESC>THIS IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR AN UPCOMING INDUSTRY DAY ONLY.  The Jacksonville District Corps of Engineers will hold an Industry Day, by Site Visit which will be held on 20 June 2008 at 0900 am beginning at Tamiami Trail, State Road No. 90 (U.S. 41), approximately 2 miles west of Krome Avenue in Miami-Dade County, FL.  The location is at the start of the project which is approximately 12 miles west of Krome Avenue on US 41, Tamiami Trail.  The site visit will begin with Jacksonville District personnel making a short presentation describing the project and technical requirements.  The site visit will end at S-334, also limited parking is available.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  However, we will be posting 60% plans and specs for the bridge and road work by 16 June 2008.  This information will be posted on ASFI for interested parties to review prior to Industry Day.  In order to prepare a list of attendees of individuals participating in this Industry Day site visit, it is requested that an e-mail be sent to Claurice.M.Dingle@usace.army.mil identifying the name of the firm, the name and title of those individuals participating, their telephone number and e-mail address.  Please include a statement in this e-mail indicating whether or not Jacksonville District may include this information when posting and/or distributing the list of attendees.<BR><BR>The purpose of the Industry Day is to partner with industry in identifying potential contractors and possible techniques to bridge a mile of Tamiami Trail and to raise the road to allow for higher stages in the L-29 canal and provide additional flow into Everglades National Park.  This is an environmentally sensitive project, because the construction is on the edge of Everglades National Park which is a pristine wetland and considered pristine state waters.  The Project Description is on State Road No. 90 (U. S. 41) between (mile post 13.692 to mile post 24.650).  This is also located from the L-31 North Bridge to the S-333 structure.  There is limited staging area.  The staging areas are located at S-333 and S-334 layout of these areas will have to be coordinated with the Contracting Officer.  Construction of one bridge on the eastern side of the project is offset from the road the width of the bridge.  The bridge shall transition from the existing alignment of the road to the south.  There is limited construction right of way for this project.  The bridge and transitions shall have two 12 travel lanes and 10 shoulders.  The transitions will require fill to raise the embankments.  The extension of two culvert sets shall be required through the road embankment.  Degrading the existing road and removal or modification of the existing culvert sets shall be necessary after completion of the bridge and transitions.  The remainder of the project is to reinforce approximately 9.7 miles of road in the existing right of way.  This will consist of milling and resurfacing, milling and overbuild, and milling and reconstruction of the road bed.  Comments from industry representatives will be considered in the preparation of the Environmental Assessment (EA) which will be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.  We anticipate issuing this project on or before 22 July 2008 as a Request For Proposal (RFP). <BR>

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:vanessa.coleman.ctr@usmc.mil">Vanessa Coleman</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Quantico, VA intends to award a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to L-3 Communications Corporation, 2 Federal Street, Camden, NJ 08102.  This source possesses unique knowledge and capabilities required to perform this service. The contracts Period of Performance includes one base year and four option years extending to October 2013.  The value of the contract is expected to be $70,000,000. 
The proposed contract action, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302, is for services required to repair, upgrade and sustain the currently fielded Tactical Remote Sensor Systems (TRSS) System-of-Systems (SoS) providing unattended sensors, retransmission systems, and sensor monitoring systems.  TRSS is deployed and operated by Ground Sensor Platoons (GSPs) in support of the Commanders intelligence collection effort.  Once deployed, the remote systems operate autonomously to provide continuous, unattended surveillance to distant areas of the battle space.  Remote sensors use multiple sensing modalities and radio communications methods to detect and report personnel and vehicle activity in designated areas of interest.
The following are components of the SoS:
1.  TRSS Unattended Ground Sensor Set (UGSS), AN/GSQ/257 is a suite of hand emplaced sensors that operate unattended and detects activity through seismic, acoustic, infrared, and magnetic sensing technologies.  The UGSS primary sensor is the Encoder-Transmitter Unit Version II (ETU-II).  The ETU-II is a low-resolution, seismic-acoustic target classification sensor which reports targets as wheeled vehicles, tracked vehicles, or personnel.  Each UGSS includes 50 Infrared Intrusion Detector, Version IIs (IRID-II) and Magnetic Intrusion Detectors (MAGID) that can be attached to the ETU-II to provide additional target discrimination and counting capabilities.  The IRID is a temperature-sensitive transducer that reports changes in its observed field of view and reports the direction of the activity it is traveling.  The MAGID recognizes changes in its near-field magnetic environment and reports direction of movement.
2.  Day/Night Imager Version II, AN/PSQ-21 is an integrated system of cameras, radios, and image processing hardware that captures and transmits images from areas under surveillance to distant sensor monitoring systems.  Upon detection of sufficient pixel changes in the Field of View (FOV), the Imager captures an image.  The Imager then uses its radio systems to send the image to sensor monitoring sites either directly, satellite communications, or via one or more Radio Repeaters.  The Imager is remotely configurable to change operational modes, select camera controls, and change radio frequencies.
3.  Hand-Held Programmer-Monitor (HHPM), AN/PSQ-22 is a portable, programmable, dual-band, sensor emplacement tool for programming sensor equipment, monitoring sensor activity, recording sensor positions, and testing Radio Frequency (RF) communications paths between remote device sites.  Sensor imagery is displayed in the HHPMs Tactical External Viewing Assembly (TEVA).  The TEVA may also be connected directly to the TRSS Imager when the user desires to see a cameras field of view.  The HHPM menu provides a variety of user-selectable display preferences and test messages designed to enable Marines to perform sensor tests and direct (cabled) reconfiguration at sensor emplacement sites.  An earphone assembly and night vision filters are provided to enable operation when light and sound discipline is required. 
4.  Radio Repeater Set, AN/GRQ-32 is a dual-band sensor retransmission system that enables communication between deployed sensors and monitoring sites when direct sensor-to-monitor radio line-of-site is precluded by terrain.  The Radio Repeater is remotely configurable to use various modes, filter messages, mask out problematic sensors, and change operating frequencies.
The Government does not own design documentation (engineering drawings, schematics, parts lists, internal wiring diagrams, firmware (imbedded software), for these configuration items.Repair services are expected to include piece part repair of internal circuit card assemblies, firmware installation, system wiring, and external user interfaces.  
The following electronic assemblies in the TRSS SoS are required to be repaired: (a) Imager-IIs Remote Intelligent Communication Controller (RICC).  The RICC provides an integrated assembly that manages the systems cameras, radios, and image processing subsystems.  (b) The Imager-IIs satellite communications modem is an L-band transceiver designed for use in a commercial low earth orbiting system. (c.) ETU-II Sensor Electronics Assembly (SEA).  The ETU-II SEA is an integrated radio and signature processor designed to interpret signals from seismic, acoustic, infrared, and magnetic detectors and communicate activity detected in the form of short data messages. (d) The IRID-II Detector Assembly is a dual-transducer, infrared detector designed to detect changes in its background environment and subsequently report the direction of movement that may pass in front of its field of view. (e) The EO/IR cameras are low power, ruggedized, 240 x 320 (EO) and 120 x 160 (IR) cameras designed for connection and control via the RICC. (f) The HHPM Receiver-Transmitter (RT) is an integrated radio, Global Positioning System (GPS), and display system. (g) The TEVA is a hand-held monocular used to view images at the RICC and HHPM RT. (f) The RR RT is a dual band transceiver used to retransmit sensor messages.
Upgrades are anticipated to include the services necessary to evaluate recommended changes, make changes at the individual devices and SoS level, modify device firmware and hardware, perform integrated test and evaluation services, and re-baseline the SoS.  Typical upgrades include correction of system deficiencies, changes to target recognition performance, programming interfaces, communications requirements, and the implementation of changes to user interfaces.
System sustainment will include production of replacement / additional articles, and refurbishment of existing systems.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Respondents must provide level of effort and dollar estimates to acquire a full understanding of the design of the equipment. As part of the written response, a respondent must be able to prove to the Government how depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A written response must include evidence of the respondents ability to support the described equipment. Interested parties with the capability of meeting the proposed requirements are requested to provide an E-mail to the MCSC point of contact, Ms. Vanessa Coleman, (vanessa.coleman.ctr@usmc.mil) not later than 1400 (2:00 p.m. EST) July 7, 2008 expressing interest and outlining their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Numbered Note: 22.

Overview InformationFederal Agency Name:  Alaska Region, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)Opportunity Title:  Sea Duck Joint Venture ProgramAnnouncement Type:  This is an annual request for proposals from the Sea Duck Joint Venture
Full Text of AnnouncementI.  Funding Opportunity DescriptionThe Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV) is a partnership-based conservation program under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that promotes the conservation of sea ducks by providing greater knowledge for effective management.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the SDJV, administers grants, purchase orders, and contracts on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance both our and the general scientific community's understanding of sea duck biology and ecology and is seeking proposals from interested parties.
The SDJV is receptive to funding annual projects as well as a limited number of multi-year (up to 3 years) projects. Successful multi-year projects will be funded in 1-year increments, subject to annual review, demonstration of suitable progress, and funds availability.  After 3 years of consecutive funding, those projects may reapply and compete for SDJV funds in one-year increments only and they will be re-evaluated based on their continued merit. 
Note:  Multi-year projects have special reporting requirements that must be addressed in both the proposal and in annual summary reports.   For example, in the proposal, submitters need to clearly define the results that will be attained annually and at the conclusion of the project (e.g., sample sizes, progress of analyses, reports and publications); in the annual summary report, the researcher must address their progress toward meeting annual and overall objectives.  Because multi-year projects commit SDJV funds for extended periods and thus limit the number of other projects which can be funded in subsequent years, they must ensure a good return on investment.  Projects with proven methodology and a high likelihood of success will likely score higher than projects with untested methodology and high risk factors (unsecured funding, weather dependent, etc.).
To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  Currently the only source of general funding is U.S. Congress-appropriated funds directed to USFWS for SDJV use -- we are expected to demonstrate effective leveraging of these funds, preferably with non-U.S.-federal resources.

Examples of Recently Funded Projects: -Spring Migration of Surf Scoters Along the Pacific Coast: Important Habitats and Energetic Implications-Identification of Beaufort Sea Migration Corridor for Sea Ducks-Breeding areas, migration routes, staging, molting, and local movements associated with both Surf and White-winged Scoters wintering in the inner marine waters of Washington State-The Effect of Hunting and Avian Cholera on the St. Lawrence Estuary Common Eiders-Inorganic Contaminant Concentrations and Body Condition of Common Goldeneye Wintering on the Great Salt Lake, Utah-Molt ecology of White-winged Scoters in the St. Lawrence estuary-Temporal and Geographic Distribution of the Aleutian Islands Pacific Common Eider-The value of herring spawn vs. alternative prey to Surf and White-winged Scoters in the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin-Molting Ecology of Surf and White-winged Scoters in Southeast Alaska-Diet of Surf Scoters Molting in Eastern North America-Distribution of Sea Ducks in Southeast Alaska:  Geographic Patterns and Relationships to Coastal Habitats(see http://seaduckjv.org/fund/sdjvfundedstudies08.pdf for additional funded projects)
II.	Award InformationIn FY2008, SDJV received 26 proposals requesting a total of $674,000 and awarded about $391,000 to 13 projects.  The median level of funding was $31,500 (range $6,544 to $53,170).  Most projects funded by SDJV are one-year projects, although multi-year projects have been funded, and will be considered in this funding cycle as well.  Interest in the SDJV is growing rapidly and we anticipate both an increase in the number of funding requests and a decrease in available funds in FY09.  The SDJV encourages modest funding requests.  Previous award winners are eligible and previously funded projects are eligible to compete for supplemental funding with applications for new awards (see section I, above).
Awards will be issued via contracts and purchase orders, based on a Service analysis of the nature of each selected project in light of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.3.  Acquisition instruments will be administered in accordance with FAR Parts 42 through 51, under the appropriate clauses of FAR Part 52, which will include a portion or all of the following clauses, dependant upon the total dollar threshold of the contract or purchase order selected for award:
Each contract or purchase order awarded shall incorporate one or more of the following clauses, by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):  http://www.acqnet.gov/far  http://www.doi.gov/pam:

III.	Eligibility InformationEligible Applicants:  Applications are encouraged from nonprofit organizations, public and private educational organizations, federal, state, local, and tribal governments and organizations, foreign governments, and individual companies.  
Cost Sharing or Matching:  To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  The match contribution may include cash or in-kind costs directly associated with the proposed work (also see #14 under Proposal Format, below).  Proposals with less than a 1:1 match will be considered, but will be ranked lower than comparable projects with a full match.  Additionally, proposals citing a match contribution which has its origin from other US Government Federal awards will be ranked lower than proposals citing a match funded through non-federal (i.e. not originally US Government in origin) funds.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<SOLNBR>2008-N-10428
<RESPDATE>081508
<CONTACT>David L Staudt, Contract Specialist, Phone 412-386-6459, Fax 412-386-6429, Email dstaudt@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a solicitation to re-compete the Technical Support for the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health's Review of NIOSH Dose Reconstruction Program contract, CDC contract number 200-2004-03805. The CDC Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS) is responsible for conducting individual dose reconstructions on employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies, its contractors and subcontractors, and Atomic Weapons Employers (AWEs) under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). To support NIOSH's role under EEOICPA, OCAS has retained the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of major program elements. Under EEOICPA, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health (Advisory Board) is required to review a reasonable sample of dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality, assess the methods for dose reconstruction, and review Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) petitions. To support the Advisory Board, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires the services of a contractor to assist in the implementation of a number of tasks related to independent review of the dose reconstruction process. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the reconstruction of dose provides a reasonable estimate of the dose (as needed to adjudicate the claim). The contractor shall evaluate and recommend whether or not the assumptions (individual case assumptions and assumptions applicable to multiple cases) made for dose reconstruction are appropriate and defensible for purposes of this program. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the data from DOE or other sources is of sufficient quality necessary to obtain a reasonable estimate of dose. The contractor shall evaluate whether or not the dose reconstruction was performed fairly using NIOSH guidelines and in a manner consistent with other cases. The contractor shall review all relevant dose reconstruction methodologies and/or procedures employed by NIOSH / NIOSH contractors in conducting individual dose reconstructions and SEC petitions. The contractor shall evaluate whether methodologies and procedures are consistent with requirements under 42 CFR 82 and whether there are sufficient procedures to achieve consistent application of the requirements in 42 CFR 82. The contractor shall conduct one of three different levels of review on the selected cases: 1) Basic Review, 2) Advanced Review, or 3) Blind Review. The method of review will be determined by the Advisory Board. The number of individual dose reconstruction reviews is estimated to be approximately 62 in the first year. It is expected that there will be approximately 30 Basic Review cases, 30 Advanced Review cases and 2 Blind Review cases. The next four years will also involve a review of approximately 62 cases per year. The breakdown of cases will be the same as described for the first year. The Advisory Board shall determine the cases to be reviewed and the level of review. These percentages are subject to change by the Advisory Board based on experience with the review process. Request for Proposal No. 2008-N-10428 will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition. The solicitation will be available on or about July 11, 2008, and proposals due by August 15, 2008. Solicitation documents will also be available at www.fbo.gov. All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<AWARDEE>Siemens Energy & Automation, Inc., Postal Automation Div.
<DESC>The Advanced Facer Canceller System (AFCS) in its existing configuration is a high-speed machine that culls, faces, and cancels letter mail through a series of automated operations. The existing AFCS fleet, in use in postal facilities for over 15 years, is nearing its end of life. The Advanced Facer Canceller System 200 (AFCS 200) will significantly enhance operational performance and improve service over the legacy system. The AFCS 200 program will replace these end-of-life components. The contract includes production, delivery, installation, integration of 550 AFCS 200 units, plus training, support, and documentation.  

Suppliers interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Peter J. LaMarca.
