<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single-source contract to NBP Corporation, Upland, CA , to continue to provide maintenance on the Integrated Control and Monitoring System (ICMS). Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to extend the current contract for maintenance service. The NBP ICMS provides a consolidation of the FAA NAVAID/VISAID system interfaces into one integrated display using a common suite of equipment.   The ICMS provides a non-baselined transition from existing status and control equipment to the FAA vision of a fully integrated tower display system which includes the need to integrate control and monitor features.  The Integrated Control and Monitoring System (ICMS), as installed at six FAA locations, is providing integrated interlock, control and monitoring of navaid systems, has had a positive impact on the space constraints in the ATCT and reduced the time required to transition an airport.   The specific requirement includes software engineering  troubleshooting, documentation support, configuration management, and repair service. ICMS was independently developed by New Bedford Panoramex and they are the only company that possesses the unique knowledge and qualifications to conduct maintenance of this system. There are no other known vendor(s) who possess this expertise or has access to the proprietary operational software and documentation from NBP.  The cost to the Government for such an assessment to be conducted by another vendor would be significantly more, the timeframes could not be met, and the engineering knowledge and resources required to accomplish it would not be availability outside of NBP.   A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to William Keller, Contracting Officer by 10:00 A.M., Eastern Time, December 20, 2007. The FAA would prefer e-mail responses. Please sent to William.k.keller-jr@faa.gov. You may also mail to: William Keller, Rm 412, Independence Ave, Washington DC 20591.

POINT(S) OF CONTACT: Contracting: JD Martin NSWC Crane, Code 0564, e-mail james.d.martin@navy.mil, 812 854-3723 Technical: Dr. Robert B. Cruise, NSCW Crane, Code JXSL, email robert.cruise@navy.mil , 812 854-8671 Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division is interested in receiving white papers which offer potential for advancement and improvement of the precision of crew-served weapons and small arms. There is an urgent need for components, systems, or algorithms/software capable of substantially reducing fires error for unguided munitions in small-unit dismounted (foot-mounted) operations, often within challenging urban environments. Both expeditionary warfare and special operations require such components and systems of high accuracy/precision, of minimal size, weight, and power requirements (SWaP), of ruggedness appropriate for the dismounted warfighter, and of cost consistent with widespread military employment. Topics of Interest Responses addressing one or more of these topics are welcome. The following topics are areas of current interest:                                                    1.   Topic A ? Weapon aiming technology The accurate aiming of dismounted weaponry with respect to true north is critical to precision engagement. A weapon aiming system is needed that is capable of determining weapon azimuth with respect to true north with a 5 mil (~ 5 mrad) accuracy (1 sigma) or better within 60 degrees N/S latitude. The system shall be suitable for mounting on an 81 mm mortar and of SWaP and ruggedness appropriate for the dismounted warfighter/weapon operating under challenging physical conditions. The mortar-mounted system shall withstand or be isolated from the shock imparted by the firing of mortar rounds, and shall operate continuously and accurately throughout the firing of rounds. Upon power-on, the system shall achieve alignment with respect to true north in less than 180 sec and thereafter shall accurately track weapon azimuth with respect to true north in accordance with the 5 mil accuracy requirement, with minimum azimuthal drift, and requiring only very occasional realignment. At any!   time subsequent to alignment the weapon itself may change azimuth by up to 360 degrees in one continuous motion at a maximum rate of 60 degrees per second. The weapon aiming system may consist of one of the following technologies: inertial gyrocompassing technology (inertial sensing of the tangential component of Earth?s angular velocity), GPS azimuth sensing, celestial azimuth sensing, digital magnetic compassing, or other means of azimuth sensing with respect to true north. Furthermore, the system may be of a hybrid nature that utilizes more than one of the preceding technologies, perhaps in conjunction with tactical grade (non-gyrocompassing) inertial sensing devices or with weapon orientation encoders. Upon establishing weapon azimuth with respect to true north, the aiming system might employ tactical grade inertial sensors or an orientation encoding subsystem to track subsequent weapon re-aiming. In particular, an orientation encoding subsystem appropriate for the dismounted mortar is of considerable interest. Specifically, this BAA seeks white papers for development of single-axis TRL-4 breadboard prototypes that demonstrate north-finding feasibility. Breadboard prototypes shall be configured for laboratory use and shall meet or exceed the following minimum performance criteria: Azimuth Accuracy 5 mils (1 sigma) Azimuth Accuracy Applicability	between 60 degrees N/S latitude Alignment Time	180 seconds If the TRL-4 prototype utilizes a weapon orientation encoding subsystem, then the prototype shall include an encoder subsystem designed specifically for the dismounted mortar. In addition to meeting/exceeding the above criteria, the TRL-4 prototypes shall credibly demonstrate how the SWaP and ruggedness requirements will be achieved by more advanced prototypes. Furthermore, the TRL-4 prototypes shall credibly demonstrate how the unit production cost consistent with widespread military employment will be achieved. Three-Year Roadmap for Topic A (only), Weapon Aiming Technology This Roadmap relates to Topic A only, is provided for information purposes only, and does not constitute a firm commitment on the part of the Government to continue development in accordance herewith. No similar Roadmap is currently available for Topics B thru E.  Following is a roadmap of a possible three-year development effort of weapon aiming technology. This roadmap consists of three milestones, each representing the completion of prototypes at successively higher technology readiness levels. The milestones are briefly outlined below and contrasted in Table 1 following. Milestone 1 ? Delivery of TRL-4 Prototypes by September 2008 The first milestone corresponds to completion and delivery for independent laboratory testing of the TRL-4 prototype described in Topic A of this BAA. Typically, each TRL-4 prototype development effort may be funded incrementally for up to one (1) year subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $50,000 and $900,000. Milestone 2 ? Delivery of TRL-5/6 Prototypes by September 2009 The goal of the second milestone is to further develop the sensor suite from the first milestone into a fully functional TRL-5/6 prototype. This prototype does not have to meet the SWaP requirements (see Table 1 below), but it should be able to demonstrate its ability to meet the azimuth performance requirement over the required pitch, roll, and slew conditions, navigate after alignment, and maintain azimuth performance at various operational temperatures. Independent testing will take place at this milestone, as in the previous milestone. Typically, each TRL-5/6 prototype development effort may be funded incrementally for up to one (1) year subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $800,000 and $1,600,000. Milestone 3 ? Delivery of TRL-7 Prototypes by July 2010 The goal of the third milestone is to further develop the sensor suite from the first two milestones into a system that will be ready for production with minimal further development. This TRL-7 prototype should meet all of the performance requirements (see Table 1 below). Independent testing will take place at this milestone, as in the previous milestone. The government will test azimuth performance in operational environments, including live fire testing on a dismounted 81 mm mortar. The vendor should supply a method for mounting the sensor on the 81 mm mortar shock buffer mechanism (developed by the government). Typically, the TRL-7 prototype development effort may be funded incrementally for up to one (1) year subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

Demo-Live Fire: Demonstrate that the sensors will meet the weapon aiming azimuth requirements under live fire conditions 2.   Topic B ? Wind velocity sensing technology  Lack of precise knowledge of wind velocity severely impacts the precision of  unguided munitions. This source of inaccuracy is traditionally quantified in terms of range error (head or tail wind dependent) and azimuthal error (cross wind dependent). A wind velocity sensing system is needed capable of determining head and cross wind velocity components along a 5,000 meter unguided munitions trajectory (2,500 meter max ordinate). The sensing system shall be accurate to within 2 knots (1 sigma) for each orthogonal velocity component. The system shall be of SWaP and ruggedness appropriate for the dismounted warfighter operating under challenging physical conditions. The sensing system might incorporate LIDAR technology, but alternative technologies such as radar or inaudible sonar may be appropriate. Cost shall be suitable for widespread employment by small dismounted warfighting units. Methods for accuracy testing of the prototype system shall be addressed. Specifically, this BAA seeks white papers for development of TRL-3 laboratory validations or TRL-4 breadboard prototypes that demonstrate wind velocity sensing feasibility. Breadboard prototypes shall be configured for laboratory use. The TRL-3/4 prototypes shall be subjected to appropriate and credible accuracy testing. The TRL-3/4 prototypes shall meet or exceed the following minimum performance criteria: Wind Velocity Sensing Accuracy	2 knots (1 sigma) Wind Velocity Sensing Range		2,000 meters In addition to meeting/exceeding the above criteria, the TRL-3/4 prototypes shall credibly demonstrate how the SWaP, ruggedness, and longer sensing range (5,000 m) requirements will be achieved by more advanced prototypes. Furthermore, the TRL-3/4 prototypes shall credibly demonstrate how the unit production cost consistent with widespread military employment will be achieved.  3.  Topic C ? Wind velocity prediction, interpolation, and extrapolation algorithms Wind velocity sensing will not occur at the precise time and location of a particular shot. Yet, the ballistic computation for a particular shot assumes the wind velocity data are current and along the trajectory. A prediction, interpolation, and extrapolation algorithm is needed that will project prior sensed wind velocity data to the moment of a planned shot. Furthermore, the algorithm shall interpolate/extrapolate from the actual sensed location(s) to the planned trajectory itself. The predictions/interpolations/extrapolations of the algorithm shall be accurate to 2 knots (1 sigma) or for each orthogonal velocity component given perfect sensed data up to 30 minutes old and 1,000 meters remote. It is anticipated that accurate atmospheric modeling on small time and length scales will be required to fulfill this need. Methods for accuracy testing of prototype algorithms shall be addressed. The algorithms shall be capable of running on a standalone laptop or tablet computer u!  nder the Microsoft Windows or Linux operating systems. Specifically, this BAA seeks white papers for algorithmic investigations that demonstrate the feasibility of wind velocity prediction/interpolation/extrapolation meeting or exceeding the following minimum performance criteria:           Computed Wind Velocity Accuracy	2 knots (1 sigma) (each velocity component) Age of Input Data			30 minutes Remoteness of Input Data		1,000 meters The investigative results shall provide appropriate and credible methods for algorithm accuracy testing. 4.  Topic D ? Muzzle velocity sensing technology Lack of precise knowledge of muzzle velocity severely impacts the precision of unguided munitions, substantially contributing to range error. A muzzle velocity sensing system for the 81 mm mortar is needed capable of determining exit velocity for each successive shot with an accuracy of 0.5 meters/sec (1 sigma). Time between rounds can be as short as 2 seconds. Sensed velocity data is utilized for adjustment of aiming parameters of subsequent rounds. The system shall be of SWaP and ruggedness appropriate for the dismounted warfighter operating under challenging physical conditions. The sensing system might incorporate photoelectric, magnetic, Hall effect, or Doppler radar technologies, but other approaches will be given equal consideration. Sensing systems requiring projectile modifications or markings will in general be considered less desirable. Cost shall be suitable for widespread employment by dismounted mortar units. Specifically, this BAA seeks white papers for development of TRL-5 to TRL-6 brassboard muzzle velocity sensing prototypes configured for mounting and testing on the dismounted 81 mm mortar. Testing will occur in a live fire environment. The TRL-5/6 prototypes shall meet or exceed the following minimum performance criteria: Muzzle Velocity Sensing Accuracy	0.5 meters per second (1 sigma) Time Between Rounds			2 seconds Operational Temperature		minus 40C to plus 70C Shock					up to 81 mm mortar shock levels Vibration				MILSTD 810 min integrity Device Plus Enclosure Volume	50 cu in Device Plus Enclosure Weight		4.0 lbs Power Consumption			10 Watts In addition to meeting/exceeding the above criteria, the TRL-5/6 prototypes shall credibly demonstrate how the unit production cost consistent with widespread military employment will be achieved. 5.   Topic E ? Muzzle velocity prediction algorithms A round?s muzzle velocity measurement cannot be applied to the ballistic computation for that round. Only a predicted muzzle velocity based on prior round measurements and other pertinent data can be applied to a round?s ballistic computation. A prediction algorithm is needed for the 81 mm mortar that will project prior sensed muzzle velocity data for use in the current shot?s ballistic computation. In addition to a time series of muzzle velocity data, such an algorithm may perhaps also utilize environmental data such as propellant temperature. The algorithm shall be able to work with various charges and types of rounds. The predictions of the algorithm shall be accurate to 0.5 meters per second (1 sigma). The algorithm shall also provide barrel wear and other failure analysis data for logistical purposes. The algorithm shall be capable of running on a standalone laptop or tablet computer under the Microsoft Windows or Linux operating systems. Specifically, this BAA seeks white papers for algorithmic investigation and development that demonstrate muzzle velocity prediction meeting or exceeding the following minimum performance criterion: Computed Muzzle Velocity Accuracy		0.5 meters per second (1 sigma) The investigative and developmental results shall provide appropriate and credible methods for algorithm accuracy testing. The investigative and developmental results shall provide methods for generating barrel wear and other failure analysis data for logistical purposes.

Typically each white paper may be funded incrementally for up to one (1) year subject to the availability of appr!  opriations and funded between $50,000 and $900,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Award of an effort under this BAA does not imply other than full and open competition in the future for follow-on acquisition(s) for the awarded task(s). Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. Additionally, theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation and/or proposed studies are specifically excluded. All criteria as outlined in FAR 35.016 are applicable. In order to minimize the cost related to proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties shall submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). The white paper should not exceed four (4) pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, a rough cost estimate, and any references. Interested parties may submit more than one white paper.  White Papers should clearly identify which aforementioned topic they are responding to. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explic!  itly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. A full technical and cost proposal may be required approximately three (3) weeks after notification that NSWC Crane has decided to pursue the offeror?s approach as identified in their white paper submission. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail. White papers  will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds). These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more imp!  ortant than price, but evaluated prices/costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA. However, early submissions are strongly encouraged.  Please send white papers via e-mail to james.d.martin@navy.mil.

All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note: N/A.   52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and: delivery/a determination of responsibility/ technically acceptable low bids/ past performance.  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or aff!  irmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or sim ilar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, Federal Tax ID Number, Cage Code, DUNs Number and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to Nicaragua's Empresa Portuaria Nacional (EPN) on the development of a national ports law that would provide the necessary legal framework for private or mixed investments in new ports, as well as the private administration of existing ports in Nicaragua.  

EPN has recognized that in order to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations which will result from the current USTDA funded Port of Corinto Competitiveness Upgrade feasibility study; EPN requires a framework for a National Ports Law (NPL) which would allow for private investment in the port sector.  The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MTI) as well as the Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce (MIFIC) have demonstrated the need for and commitment to the passage of a NPL.

The National Commission for the Promotion of Exports, which is made up of five governmental appointees and five private sector representatives, has met officially to discuss the need for a National Ports Law and port policy reform.  Concepts discussed by the Commission include the need for a new east coast port and public-private partnership options.  Currently at the Port of Corinto, private operators carry out various functions within the port, but they do not have investments in the facilities.  The enactment of a National Ports Law is intended to improve the competitiveness of Nicaraguan ports and improve the efficiency of operations to achieve lower costs for importers and exporters.  Increasing trade is a national objective of the Government of Nicaragua to stimulate economic development of the country.  Competitive infrastructure is a key to achieving this objective.  

The objectives of the TA program are broadly defined as follows:

	Review international port policy reform efforts and provide an assessment of the applicability to Nicaragua's efforts;
	Review Nicaragua's other policy reform efforts that encourage private investments in the public sector for consideration within the framework of the NPL;
	Develop the framework and regulations for a transparent and equitable law incorporating the port policy reform objectives;
	Establish realistic benefits and goals for the Government of Nicaragua as part of the port policy reform;
	Develop the draft documents for tendering port projects by preparing suggested formats, requirements, and criteria for evaluation of tenders;
	Provide recommendations for the reorganization of EPN's responsibilities which may result from improved competitiveness, port policy reform, and greater investment and operational participation from the private sector.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $510,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION. THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. The High Power Microwaves Technologies Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (RD), Kirtland AFB New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave, millimeter wave, and other directed energy systems via this High Energy Research and Applications (HERA) program. 

B. The HERA program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high energy research to include High Power Microwave (HPM), and millimeter wave system and technology development. This program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/RDH capital resources, facilities, and experience. This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power. In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D service and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities. Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory, the High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/RD, and portions of  other AFRL buildings. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR). As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive laboratory / facilities service and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.  Most contractor personnel will be required to have SECRET level clearances, and some must be clearable for access to RESTRICTED DATA, CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN INFORMATION, FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA, SCI, and Non-SCI.

C. The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $60-75M over five years.
 
FY08 - $12-15M; FY09 - $12-15M; FY10 - $12-15M; FY11 - $12-15M; FY12 $12-15M.

The resulting contract will be awarded with a not-to-exceed ceiling of $75M. This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards. This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area. If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order. If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: overall scientific and technical merits, importance to AFRL/RD programs; and affordability. AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation. Technical Areas are described below. 

TECHNICAL AREA 1. High Power Microwave Development: 

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW and average/continuous (CW) HPM systems capable of generating hundreds of kW to few MW are of interest to the HERA program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target. The thrust of this activity is to
--	Identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power, and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; also of interest are sources that can provide average/CW power of hundred of kW to few MW.
--	Execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results.
--	Downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results.
--	Coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred. 

Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Area 2 is expected. A further aspect of this technical area is to 
--	Investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development. Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere. Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits. 

TECHNICAL AREA 2. Theoretical and Computational R&D: 

The objectives of this technical area are to develop theoretical techniques and computational tools to:
--	Advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.
--	Conduct numerical analysis of such devices which typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types. Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.
--	Explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies. This task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.
--	Gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems. The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  
--	Conduct engagement level Model and Simulation (M&S) to address scale system requirements. For example, use of EADSIM to assess duty cycle impact on mission for airborne active denial.
--	Describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target." These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, and scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.
--	Determine scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.

TECHNICAL AREA 3. Pulsed Power (PP) and Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D: 

The goals of this technical area are to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems. This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/RD applications. The work under this Technical Area includes: 
--	Hardware design, fabrication, assembly, and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems. Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state). Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.

This Technical Area also includes the exploration and development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical areas. The scope of this effort includes 
--	Designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s). Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads. 

Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators. Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances. Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads. Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds. 

Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds. Pulse power systems work may include 
--	Fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics. 

This technical area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles. Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments. Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times. The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds. Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.
 
TECHNICAL AREA 4.  Prime Power: 

The goal of this technical area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems. This is an enabling technical area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains. Areas of research for this technical area include 
--	Design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like. 
--	Investigation and modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

TECHNICAL AREA 5.  Technology Demonstrator Development, Operation and Testing

The objective of this technical area is to develop a full scale prototype once a technology is identified for development.  This includes 
--	Conceptual studies, system designs, design drawings, fabrication of subsystems, system integration, engineering and technician support in servicing (including spares) and operating such prototype for purpose of testing and demonstration.  Emphasis should be placed on balancing risk, use of commercial of the shelf (COTS), state-of-the art and/or new subsystem technologies for full system design and development.   
--	Platforms to be considered for system integration and demonstrator development should include but not be limited to land and airborne systems.

TECHNICAL AREA 6.  System Integration and Demonstration

The objective of this technical area is to develop, simulate, fabricate, test, demonstrate, package and fully integrate HPM aerial and ground systems according to form, fit, and function requirements defined by AFRL/RDH using HPM technology. HPM technology includes but is not limited by, existing sources such as the Advanced Counter Electronic Source (ACES), or newly developed sources such at the Relativistic Magnetron (RelMag). The intentions of this task area are to deliver aerial and ground based HPM weapon systems to the end user that is close to an end product.  This task includes: 
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM system, military feasibility studies of the integrated package, system designs, fabrication of components to fabrication of the majority of the system, survivability studies, testing for EMI/EMC,  testing individual components, testing the overall system, operator manuals, engineering and technician support, and demonstrating the system in an operational realistic environment.
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems satisfying form and fit requirements of the end user by designing or replacing components with more efficient, smaller, or lighter technology. This fit requirement can also be satisfied by a redesign of the overall system or the redesign of the orientation of components to ensure the dimensions and weight is minimized.
--	For aerial systems safety of flight and SEEK EAGLE standards should be taken into account for design of the end product. Additionally, survivability, fusing methods, delivery of the platform to one or more three-dimensional points in space, and internal/external modifications to the aerial platform should be taken into account. Due to the nature of the aerial platform, an in-depth understanding of air platforms is required as well as requirements of the United States Air Force concerning these types of systems should be understood. The aerial platform options may include current munition type inventories and/or specifically designed systems for HPM payloads. 
--	For aerial HPM systems the delivery method includes fighter and/or bomber type aircraft. Detailed knowledge and understanding is required to successfully merge the aerial HPM system to the aircraft.
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the military feasibility studies is to determine the effectiveness and worthiness of the integrated system given the appropriate platform and HPM parameters. This includes studies of the effectiveness against targets sets such as centers of gravities and facilities with electronic systems. 
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the survivability studies is to ensure the continued nominal operation of the integrated system in the presence of extremes such as, but not limited to, vibration, pressure, and temperature. The survivability study shall take into account the platform of the integrated system. 
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the demonstration phase is to validate military feasibility and worthiness against realistic target sets and collateral effects on subsystems in real world scenarios. The demonstration shall take into account the platform of the integrated system. Platforms considered for system integration shall include but is not limited to airborne and mobile ground based systems.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Geographic Medicine and Health Promotion Branch, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ), Travelers? Health Team has responsibility for a textbook for health-care providers, Health Information for International Travel (the ?Yellow Book?). The Yellow Book, also available in its entirety online, has long been considered the ?gold standard? of travel medicine, both in the United States and abroad. Information contained in the Yellow Book is heavily relied on by health-care practitioners, travelers, the travel industry, and others who advise travelers, and is frequently cited in medical as well as non-medical publications, including news media such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. The production team for the Yellow Book continues to work towards creating a resource that contains current health recommendations for international travel, delivered in a user-friendly format that can be readily applied in the clinical setting.  The book is published every two years, with the most recent book (Yellow Book 2008) published in May 2007.  DGMQ?s objective is to make the 2010 version of the Yellow Book more useful for and more targeted to US travel medicine and general healthcare practitioners. DGMQ is seeking the services of a physician expert in travel medicine to serve as a Medical Editor (ME) for the 2010 edition. It is expected that the scientific and technical contribution of the ME to the 2010 edition would result in increased usability of the book by the 40,000 US general healthcare practitioners and 2000 travel medicine specialists who are asked to provide pre travel advice to patients planning international travel and who see patients after they return from travel.  Services required will be as follows: 1) Review 2008 Yellow Book; 2) Formulate vision for 2010 Yellow Book; 3) Develop instructions for authors; 4) Develop Table of Contents for new edition; 5) Identify subjects for  special box commentaries; 6) Identify additional external authors; 7) Liaise with external authors; 8) Write selected chapters; 9) Write special box commentaries; 10) Edit 1/3 of the chapters; 11) Liaise with publisher after submission; 12) Develop marketing strategies for increased distribution; 13) Book promotion after publication.  The cycle of production for the next version (Yellow Book 2010) began in September 2007 and will be completed when the 2010 book is published in May 2009.  It is expected that the overall time spent on the project by the ME will be approximately two months per year for two years.  The ME will not be required to work at CDC; the work can be done from home, but travel to CDC or other locations will be expected several times a year to meet with CDC staff.  A best value request for quotations for these services will be issued on or about 28 December 2007 with award anticipated on or about 30 January 2008.  All responsible sources will be invited to submit proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

Due to delays and the desire to obtain greater competition and to continue to reduce barriers to entry, the U.S. Department of State has canceled Request for Proposals RFP SALMEC-07-R-0046, SALMEC-07-R-0047 and SALMEC-07-R-0048 and created RFP SAQMMA08R0124, SAQMMA08R0125, and SAQMMA08R0126, in their place. All offerors that submitted proposals under RFP SALMEC-07-R-0046, SALMEC-07-R-0047 and SALMEC-07-R-0048 are automatically grandfathered into the new respective competitions provided they submit an addendum package that meets the new past performance requirements outlined below. A letter is also being sent to each offeror articulating this. Previously submitted proposals will be rolled over to the new competitions. Note rolling over a proposal does not suggest that the proposal was responsive, responsible, determined to be technically acceptable or prequalified. All proposals received by the closing date will be evaluated.

<DESC>Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) of the Department of State (DoS) has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities both domestic and abroad. The Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS) program is an effort by the Department of State to pre-plan, organize, set up, deploy and operate Contractor protective service details for the protection of U.S. and/or certain foreign government high-level officials whenever the need arises.

In support of Diplomatic Security's protection responsibilities throughout Iraq, the High Threat Protection Division (HTP), Office of Overseas Protective Operations (DS/IP/OPO), has recently awarded a Task Order under one of its Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS II) contracts.  The Task Order  provides for delivery of regional aviation services for security service hubs within Iraq, including aviation transportation services for Search and Rescue (SAR), Medical Evacuations (ME), transporting Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) to respond to incidents, and providing limited air transportation (AT) for Chief of Mission personnel to conduct official business.

DS requires comprehensive in theater quality assurance (QA) support to monitor the performance of the aviation services contractor (ASC) and provide timely and effective input on the ASC's performance as it relates to contract compliance with the Aviation Support Task Order and WPPS II base contract to HTP.  This function should be performed with emphasis on adaptability to changing situations within a combat theater in which all parties are required to engage in creative evolution of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP).  The QA functions should include as a minimum oversight over the contractor's ability to receive, apply and distribute current TTP information.  In this regard, the QA function adds responsibilities that are not traditional to the peacetime CONUS environment.

SAQMMA08R0124 for 8(a)
SAQMMA08R0125 for Service Disabled Veteran Owned
SAQMMA08R0126 for HubZone


Due to delays and the desire to obtain greater competition and to continue to reduce barriers to entry, the U.S. Department of State has canceled Request for Proposals RFP SALMEC-07-R-0046, SALMEC-07-R-0047 and SALMEC-07-R-0048 and created RFP SAQMMA08R0124, SAQMMA08R0125, and SAQMMA08R0126, in their place. All offerors that submitted proposals under RFP SALMEC-07-R-0046, SALMEC-07-R-0047 and SALMEC-07-R-0048 are automatically grandfathered into the new respective competitions provided they submit an addendum package that meets the new past performance requirements outlined below. A letter is also being sent to each offeror articulating this. Previously submitted proposals will be rolled over to the new competitions. Note rolling over a proposal does not suggest that the proposal was responsive, responsible, determined to be technically acceptable or prequalified. All proposals received by the closing date will be evaluated. Offerors that have submitted packages previously are welcome to change, revise, or resubmit their proposal by the closing date in their addendum package. 

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) services and is seeking proposals from firms for design-build projects at DOS Foreign Service posts worldwide.  The DOS anticipates award of up to six IDIQ contracts under which firms will compete through a proposal process for individual task orders.  The purpose of this solicitation is to enlarge the pool of MEP firms available to DOS for this overseas work, increase competition, provide opportunity, and reduce barriers to entry for firms which do not have existing DOS contracts or subcontract for DOS work.  DOS is seeking to award two IDIQ contracts each to SBA 8(a) Contractors under RFP SAQMMA08R0124, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concern contractors under RFP SAQMMA08R0125, and HUB Zone contractors under RFP SAQMMA08R0126, to perform MEP Contractor services. The task order work may include classified (initially requiring Secret clearances, future potential for Top Secret work) design build construction services. DOS Overseas Building Operations (OBO), the Contracting Officer and Diplomatic Security (DS) will work with the successful offerors, to obtain required security clearances.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>QUESTIONS DUE: 0900 EST, 20-Dec-07. COMMENTS and CAPABILITIES STATEMENT (5 pages maximum) DUE: 0900 EST, 02-Jan-08. Responses to this RFI should be directed to: Kate McCune, kathryn.mccune@us.army.mil.    REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Introduction: T he purpose of this RFI is to survey the market and determine the appropriate direction in obtaining this type of support. Submission of a capabilities statement should be no more than a maximum of 5 pages. Comments regarding this requirement are not includ ed in the page limitation. Please identify all submissions with the solicitation number W81XWH-08-ISR-RFI.   REQUIREMENT INFORMATION: The purpose of this announcement is for the establishment of a Data and Coordinating Center (DCC) to provide the necessary  infrastructure to conduct a collaborative trial to identify the optimal blood component resuscitation ratios for patients receiving massive transfusion. Up to twenty-five centers will participate in this study as part of the Multi-Center Consortium (MCC) to correlate transfusion practices and blood component ratios.  These centers have already been collaborating on a retrospective review of this topic, and the DCC is required in order to advance to a prospective data collection phase.  Only 5-10% of all co mbat casualties require massive transfusion (10 units of PRBCs), but this group constitutes those most at risk for hemorrhagic death. In Iraq and Afghanistan, a 1:1 ratio of plasma to PRBC known as damage control resuscitation (DCR), started within minutes  of arrival to the emergency department (ED) has improved outcomes in massive transfusion patients. In massively transfused patients when this 1:1 ratio of plasma to PRBCs was used, mortality was 20%, compared to 65% in equally injured transfused at 1:4 ra tio casualties (p less than 0.001; unpublished data, Spinella and Perkins). In civilian trauma centers uncontrolled hemorrhage is also one of the leading causes of potentially preventable death. Most physicians use the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support  (ATLS) guidelines, starting resuscitation with crystalloid, then moving to PRBC and only after liters of these fluids, adding plasma, platelets and more rarely, cryoprecipitate, with transfusion plasma to PRBC ratios varying from 1:1 to 1:10. This standar d practice likely serves to exacerbate the coagulopathy of trauma, present on admission in the most critically injured patients. We anticipate that the study will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase will be a run-in phase lasting approximately six  months.  This phase will include all elements of the second phase but will serve to ensure that appropriate implementation of the Transfusion Clinical Practice Guideline, patient enrolment, data collection, sample collection and processing and data integr ity issues are addressed prior to the initiation of the main study phase.  Phase II will last approximately 12 months, consist of 300-450 patient enrolments, and include collection of treatment data, outcomes data, site laboratory values, and collection of  samples for central laboratory processing.  <BR><BR>The DCC will be expected to:<BR>* Establish infrastructure for reporting of clinical data  <BR>o Establish a secure web based data submission form and management of Consortium-developed comprehensive dat a collection and data management systems that addresses the needs of all Sites in terms of access to data, data security, and data integrity measures<BR>o Conduct ongoing data analysis to monitor site data quality metrics, compliance with inclusion and exc lusion criteria and enrolment rates<BR>o Identify missing and erroneous data entries, generate queries to the submitting site and resolve data quality issues <BR>o Develop the prospective data collection protocol<BR>o Establishment and management of proced ures to ensure that all sites maintain compliance with local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the Army Surgeon Generals Human Subjects Research Review Bo ard (HSRRB) for the conduct of clinical studies and the protection of human subjects<BR>o Establish infrastructure for<BR>1. annual meeting consortium members to be conducted conjunction with a national trauma meeting such as ATACCC, AAST, or similar.<BR>2 . support of standing consortium committees (Publication, Laboratory, Data Analysis, Blood bank, Transfusion Clinical Practice Guidelines)<BR>* Contract with Consortium members initiate data collection and disburse payments<BR>o Conduct initial site survey  and assessment<BR>o Contract for the required materiel and personnel infrastructure to begin data and sample collection<BR>o Conduct site initiation visit to ensure that each site can successfully initiate data and sample collection<BR>o Conduct initial a nd ongoing training for study site personnel, maintain records of site study specific training <BR>o Conduct periodic site visits to ensure continued compliance with contractual agreements and study quality<BR>* Coordinate sample collection and processing< BR>o Establish central laboratory capability to ensure the standardized analyses of specimens through the establishment of a core facility<BR>o Coordinate collection, shipping, processing, data collection and reporting of centrally processed laboratory val ues<BR>o Coordinate the long term storage of reference clinical samples for future use<BR>* Conduct data analysis<BR>o Conduct ongoing data analysis for primary and secondary study endpoints, report these ongoing data analyses to government representatives  on a quarterly basis<BR>o Plan and conduct statistical analysis of data<BR>* Post-data collection <BR>o Conduct final data analysis and publish reports of primary and secondary study endpoints<BR>o Conduct site close out<BR>o Provide administrative, edito rial, and statistical support for publication of study results in peer reviewed journals<BR>It is the responsibility of the Coordinating Center PI to clearly and explicitly state how the proposed Coordinating Center will provide administrative support, ass istance with protocol development, assistance with the human use regulatory processes, statistical support, data management and storage, as well as the responsibilities described above, for up to 15 Clinical Study Sites.<BR><BR><BR>Proposed Study Sites and  POC<BR><BR>1.

<DESC>The following is the answer to the remaining question.

Q. How does the government process F-1 non US citizens for a secure facilty and who sponsors them?

A.  The F-1 visa is a student visa and can only be issued if someone is attending USU as a student.  Once the student applies and is accepted to the university, an I-20 is produced in teh SEVIS system, which is sent to the student in their home country.  There is no sponsor. 
  
The due date for proposals is not extended.  The due date for questions is not extended. Please refer to section L for proposal submission instructions.

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is seeking proposals for an Information Architecture (Software and Hardware) Design, which will enable logistics modernization for the United States Marine Corps (USMC). This Information architecture will be a core component of the Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) ONR Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program. We expect that multiple awards will be issued, with a down selection to a single design with the selected performer having the  opportunity to develop and demonstrate the Information Architecture as part of the S&RL Program. Inherent in the design will be the capability to integrate / demonstrate multiple components either from existing USMC logistics systems or S&T products developed under separate contract.
The program goal is to develop and demonstrate a flexible, distributed ?systems of systems? networked architecture - both hardware and software - capable of providing measurable advances in logistics Planning, Decision, Execution, and Assessment (PDE&A) functions. 

The following are the main Products Areas for the S&RL program. These products are listed to provide potential offerors insight into the scope of the overall S&RL program focus areas and technical efforts needed to address them for this solicitation.  The products should transition into Programs of Record (PORs) such as Global Combat Support System ? Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) or Autonomic Logistics (AL) baseline in technology spirals for early transition. 

Intelligent Sensor Systems ? Complex data sensors operating on scavenged power that are network addressable. Part of a mesh network infrastructure monitoring equipment health, operating status, location, and state to LRU level.  Smart sensor and signal processing algorithms for a variety of sensors capable of maximizing knowledge extraction at the point of collection and minimizing the bandwidth needed to propagate information (knowledge would be forwarded if deemed useful by the processing algorithm).

Intelligence Agent Technologies ? Capability to accurately assess platform health, usage, and remaining useful life for disparate equipment/system types.  Component level, system level, platform level, and enterprise level prognostics models that function in an open, distributed network environment.  Agents that generate ontologies based on correlation between unit tactical compositions, mission requirements and logistic resources required to sustain operational tempo. Emergent behaviors are quantified and leveraged in an adaptive environment.

Predictive and Adaptive Fuels Management Tool ? Planning and decision support tools to improve battlefield fuel management (options generator for dynamic allocation, automated status and location, platform consumption forecasting, rate of usage).  

Decision Support Tools ? Capability for performing predictive planning, adaptive analysis of evolving environments, real time dynamic updates, data analysis and courses of action development based on Commander?s intent.  Automated tasking and assessment tools for accurately determining measures of effectiveness. 

Numbered Notes:
13.  The proposed contract is restricted to domestic sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. Accordingly, foreign sources, except Canadian sources, are not eligible for award.

<SOLNBR>W15QKN-07-R-0308
<RESPDATE>121707
<ARCHDATE>01162008
<CONTACT>Michael Samra, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3965
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment, for clarification purposes, is to respond to the following questions which  prospective offerors have posed regarding the  solicitation for the Improved Increment Protector: 1.	What is the current increment protector in use?  Can we view the  previous award, design? Answer:	The old/current design is not necessary to respond to the RFP. 2.	What is the current increment protector being used for the 120mm mortar  ammunition? Answer:	The current increment protector is used to avoid damage to 120mm  Propelling charges (aka: increments). 3.	Are there design and technical specification on that protector  available for evaluation when designing the Improved Increment Protector?  Answer:	If necessary, and assuming concurrence of the Project Manager (PM) and  Integrated Project Team (IPT), the current design and technical specifications  may be furnished after contract award. However, this is not necessary for  response to the RFP. 4.	Are the use of recycled/reclaimed materials allowable as long as they  still meet performance specifications? Answer:	Addressed in PRF-XXX06 attached in RFP. (see pg11 of PRF XXX06) 5.	Can we have the exact dimensions of the 120mm mortar ammunition and the  attached increment propelling charges? Answer:	The exact dimensions are not required to respond to the RFP. 6.	How much engineering freedom do we have with regards to the design?   Can we modify to include a latching mechanism as long as it still fits in the  PA174 MONOPAQ. ? Answer:	Detailed drawings are already in the proposal. There is no latching  mechanism on the government supplied drawings. We are open to suggestions but  the Government will have final decision on design IAW PKGDIV1001 and all other  related requirements. Also, latching mechanism in addition to the overall  packaging system would have to meet all other requirements cited in the RFP. If  proposer submits a latch system, it would be at the proposer's own risk.  7.	The foam insert and liner is described in the drawings.  With it is  listed an approved distributor. Is this to say that the foam insert has been  designed and needs only to be ordered and installed into our design of the  IIP?   And is it then established that the specified foam with polyethylene  backing meets all the applicable standards, such as those described in 3.4.3,  3.6.3 and 3.6.5 of the performance specifications? Answer:	The PKGDIV1001 Protector assembly must perform as a system to protect  the propelling charges. Depending on what material is selected/proposed for the  Protector itself may affect how the foam performs when used in conjunction such  a material. It is up to submitter to ensure the resin selected matches up  appropriately with the foam to meet the overall requirements.  8.	The prints are not so clear in detail to show how the two halves are to  be held together.  a.	Or are we to design the snap feature? (Which we are very capable of  doing)  Answer:  Two identical halves are applied to the propelling charges and fin  assembly of a 120mm mortar cartridge.  Corresponding surfaces of the parts come  together.  The two halves are then held together with tape.  We are not asking  for any kind of joining feature to be designed. 9.	Is a CAD file available? This would clear up a host of smaller  questions and actually get everyone a very accurate quote as opposed to using  just drawings. Answer:  A CAD file is not available at this time.  10.	One of the deliverables is specifically called out as mold drawings but  in another section, the requirements are such that we furnish sufficient  information so that any one who is familiar with injection molding can  reproduce the item. Will a CAD model of the mold and the part fulfill the  requirements of the contract? Answer:  A CAD model of both the part and the mold is sufficient to meet this  requirement. 11.	I could not find anything specific to packaging so I assume the  prototypes would be shipped to ?? via standard commercial packaging, correct? Answer:  Commercial packaging is acceptable.  The parts will be shipped to  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. All of the terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged.

<DESC>Q. Are you looking at alternative solutions, for example, liquid cooled vests to replace the current MCS in the Paladin Howitzer M109A6? A. The Paladin system is not looking to incorporate liquid cooled vests into the system at this time.  The primary function of the MCS (Microclimatic CONDITIONING System) is to provide NBC filtered air to the crew.  It also has the functionality to provide cooled NBC filtered air.  The purpose of this solicitation is to handle the reliability problems of our current MCS by  upgrading some of the components on the MCS system (completing the conversion to R134a, etc).  We acknowledge that liquid cooled vests are available, they do not completely solve our situation of providing NBC filtered air to the crew and thus are not an acceptable solution to this solicitation. Q. Can you please provide the location of the current MCS within the Paladin? A. The MCS unit is located within the MCS enclosure on the roof of the Paladin Cab.

<DESC>The Response Date/Closing Date for the Pre-Solicitation Notice is hereby extended from October 5th, 2007 to November 5th 2007. The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Acquisition Center at Picatinny Arsenal,NJ  07806-5000 intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to update and modify the current Microclimatic Control System (MCS) that is used in the Paladin Howitzer M109A6.  The MCS had been incorporated to alleviate thermal stresses, filter nuclear, biological, and chemical contaminants from the crew members. The current Paladin MCS provides up to 100 scfm of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) filtered air which is temperature conditioned in hot ambient environments and has a vapor cycle refrigeration unit.  The air is supplied to five crew stations via Y-diverter valves, which split the airstreams between a ventilated face piece and an air cooled vest.  In cold environment operation, each of the five crew airstreamsare heated with an M3 heater unit. This project will emonstrate and modify the current MCS to improve the reliability and performance, replace the current R12 compressor, rework the tubing and fitting to conform the R134a requirement, replace the existing R12 low pressure cutoff switch with a R134a low pressure cutoff switch, redesign the unreliable and under-rated vane axial fan, redesign/modify the crew blow, redesign/modify/improve air flow on the relay panel/enclosure to eliminate the circuit breakers cutoff problems, and provide recommendations on other system upgrades. The Government intends to award this contract on a best value basis using Full and Open Competition. The contracting vehicle will be a Firm-Fixed Priced Contract. It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted on the US ARMY JM&L LCMC Procurement Network website located at http://procnet.pica.army.mil on or about 11/05/07. Proposals will be required on or before, but no later than 30 days thereafter. The period of performance for this effort is to complete all tasks no later than nine months after contract award - FY08.  Point of contact for this requirement and to obtain MCS drawing no. 12553830 is Michael Grant, Contract Specialist,michael.grant16@us.army.mil, Donna Apgar, Contracting Officer, donna.apgar@us.army.mil. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for anyinformation submitted under this announcement.  Electronic submittals are preferred. See note 26.

<DESC>Q1. 4.5.13 Target Impact Verification states that the Celotex test shall be performed simultaneously with the lock cylinder breaching test at up to 3 inches.  However, in 4.5.13a for conformance inspection, it is a separate test from the breaching test.  Is the intent to test the blowback of the lock cylinder during breaching, or to test blowback in general as stated in the conformance inspection?  We believe that attempting to test target impact during breaching may obscure the breaching test results due to the difficulty of shooting at such a small target thru a blinder and would like to know if we can test target impact according to conformance inspection methods.  This is the same for 4.5.14 Projectile Ballistic Integrity Verification. A1. Target impact verification is conducted during design verification, First Article Test, and conformance inspection.  4.5.13 details the procedure for target impact verification during design verification and FAT.  4.5.13a details the procedure for target impact verification during conformance inspection.  There are no known issues with testing for target impact verification during breaching verification.  Since the target is only 3 inches from the shotgun, there is no issue with aiming.

Introduction and Overview: The USAID/Uganda Senior Food for Peace Officer (SFFPO) is an integral member of the Economic Growth Team.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer is the principal staff person at USAID/Uganda responsible for the coordination and management of the Mission?s PL-480 Title II Program.  The PL-480 Title II Program has two components: (1) the Non-emergency Program, which was valued at approximately $19 million in FY07; and (2) the Emergency Program, which has grown substantially as a result of the crisis in northern Uganda and was nearly $45 million in FY07.  In addition, the Senior Food for Peace Officer is responsible for oversight of the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) program in Uganda.  Under this program, OFDA provided approximately $13 million of humanitarian relief assistance to Uganda in FY07.
The Senior Food for Peace Officer performs representational, policy advisory, technical leadership, and program management roles.  As a senior development professional, he, she is responsible for providing technical guidance and policy advice to USAID senior management and the U.S. Ambassador to Uganda.  He, she is also responsible for ensuring that USAID and Embassy senior staff and host country counterpart officials, to include the Ministerial level,  are informed of the U.S. food aid program as a whole, as well as the current situation vis-a-vis the humanitarian crisis in the north.  He, she is also responsible for ensuring that senior USAID Washington officials, including at the Assistant Administrator level, are well informed of the humanitarian and food security situation on-the-ground in Uganda.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer is also responsible for building strong and constructive relationships with other donors, the World Food Program, and the senior staff of U.S. Private Voluntary Organizations and Ugandan Non-Governmental Organizations.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer is also responsible for maintaining strong and supportive relationships with the USAID technical offices in Washington, i.e., the Office of Food for Peace and the OFDA, as well as in the USAID East Africa Regional Office in Nairobi.  The Senior Food for Peace officer is also responsible for maintaining close working relationships with his or her counterparts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  As a senior technical advisor, the Senior Food for Peace Officer is responsible for ensuring that the food aid program in Uganda reflects best practices and state-of-the-art knowledge about food aid policies and approaches, including food distribution, monetization, and humanitarian assistance.  He, she will also play a key role for the USAID Mission and the Embassy in monitoring the humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda and ensuring that policy makers in Washington have the accurate information they need to make Agency-level resource allocation decisions.  Other specifics. 1.  The non-Emergency Program consists of four multi-year Development Assistance Programs or Multi-year Assistant Programs, and involves both direct food distribution and the monetization of food aid.  The total estimated like of activity value of the non Emergency portfolio is over Dollars 110 million.  The current Title II Cooperating Sponsors are: ACDI VOCA, Save the Children, World Vision, and Catholic Relief Services. Two of the current DAPs end in FY08, and there are four anticipated FY08 MYAP submissions.  Approximately 10 million Dollars in local currency is generated annually through the Title II monetization consortium in which all the Title II non-Emergency partners participate.  Funds generated through commodity monetization are provided to all cooperating sponsors based upon their approved commodity tonnage percentage.  Title II resources are used in the support of agricultural food security programming, HIV AIDS and MCHN feeding, improved feeder roads, rural financial services, and improved household nutrition.  2. USAID?s partner in the implementation of the Title II Emergency program is the World Food Program.  USAID is WFP's most important donor in Uganda, providing 50 percent of the resources implemented by WFP.  Title II emergency resources are directed at IDPs, refugees, and drought affected and other vulnerable populations. 3. Meanwhile, OFDA humanitarian relief assistance is currently channeled through 15 partners, 12 of which are PVOs and three of which are UN agencies i.e., FAO, UNICEF, and OCHA - the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  The sectoral areas of coverage for OFDA funding include water and sanitation, health and nutrition, shelter, food security, and the distribution of basic non food commodities to conflict affected populations.   The OFDA funded NGOs work throughout northern Uganda. 4. The Senior Food for Peace Officer will also provide oversight to selected activities carried out in northern Uganda using USAID Uganda resources. 5. Reporting Requirements.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer reports to the SO7 Team Leader; an FS 01 General Development Officer, who in turn reports to the Deputy Director of USAID Uganda.  For detailed scope of work including overall duties and responsibilities and evaluation criteria, please send email to gnakaddu@usaid.gov, copy rheller@usaid.gov.

Heavy Construction ? size standard $13 Million and Subsector 235 ? Special Trade Contractors ? Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. 

Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Anticipated individual task orders may range from $2,500 - $4,000,000.  The program value is still under consideration, but at this point in time, the program is expected Not-to-Exceed $60,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The number of awards the government will award is still under consideration, however at this point in time the government anticipates awarding 5 contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP may identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  

This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. 

In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your (a) interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate (b) if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small, (c) provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued March 2008.  

The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at www.eps.gov./ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to issue a sole source contract to procure field level maintenance support, training support, depot level maintenance support, technical support, help desk support, spare parts and miscellaneous services and support to directly support ongoing procurement actions of fielded VRC-110 radio systems, consisting of Tactical Hand Held Radio (THHR) units and Dual Vehicular Adapters (DVA) for the United States Marine Corps (USMC).  The VRC-110 was procured through a General Services Administration contract (M67854-07-A-7073) with Harris Corporation, RF Division.   MARCORSYSCOM intends to award the contract to Harris Communications, RF Division, 1680 University Ave, Rochester NY. 14610.  Market research has shown that there are no third-party service providers authorized to conduct service on the Harris VRC-110.  The use of non-authorized maintenance providers will cause the Original Equipment Manufacturer warranty to be v!  oided. Support and services are expected to be required at multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations. The contract awarded under this action is expected to be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery ? Indefinite Quantity contract with a maximum value of approximately $76 million.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract under this action in February, 2008. No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than 3:00pm local time on 28 JAN 2008 to Maj. Joseph Butkus at joseph.butkus@usmc.mil.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Parties that intend to submit a statement of capability are asked to notify the Government of that intent no later than 3:00pm local time on Jan 3, 2008. Numbered Note:  22

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is soliciting ideas/solutions for a test asset for airborne open air optical sensor operation.  Information is desired for any of three options below: (1) Hosting a primary sensor for radiometrically calibrated data collection, (2), Hosting one or more guest sensors (primarily MDA interceptor seekers in a captive carry configuration), or (3), Both 1 and 2 above. This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time and no funding has currently been allocated for award.  This notice is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract nor otherwise pay for information/items provided in response to this RFI.


Background:	MDA developed and operated the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) as a test asset supporting missile defense flight tests by performing optical data collection and hosting guest sensors in a captive carry configuration.  The WASP is a DC-10 aircraft modified for open air sensor viewing, and includes a primary sensor system (PSS) for radiometrically calibrated data collection.  The PSS is similar to MDA's High Altitude Observatory-II (HALO-II) sensor.  The WASP was removed from service for an indeterminate time period.  


MDA is soliciting options for a replacement or at least partial replacement of the WASP capability.  MDA requires an airborne platform for open air optical data collection at missile defense flight tests.  Both manned and unmanned aircraft options will be considered.  For the radiometrically calibrated data collection mission, MDA's PSS sensor is available, or the contractor may propose an alternative primary sensor; however the alternate sensor must meet or exceed the PSS sensor performance.  For the captive carry mission, the platform must have the ability to add or interchange guest sensors in a common configuration.  The contractor will propose, and the contractor and government will jointly establish, the common configuration.  The contractor performing the platform development activity will operate (provide mission support) and maintain the platform and data collection primary sensor (if included on the platform).  More than one platform may be considered depending on technical and programmatic considerations.


Top-level technical requirements:

1.	Possess the payload flexibility (weight, volume, power, thermal, environmental, communications, etc.) to accommodate the primary sensor and/or guest sensor(s) with open port viewing.
2.	Support MDA flight tests and events of interest at locations from the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean) with the corresponding deployment/logistics limitations, and communications requirements.

3.	Operate the aircraft at or above 40,000 feet altitude for data collection events for a minimum time of 4 hours.

4.	Operate the aircraft with an endurance of at least 6 hours.
5.	Provide real-time mission communications to uplink and downlink trajectory tracks and reference times, and downlink sensor imagery (images and video (256 kb/s minimum bandwidth)) over the entire operational range of MDA test events.
6.	Designed for a minimum of 10 years operational life (700 maximum endurance flights).


Should this request for information result in a request for proposal, potential offerors will have access via FedTeds to all MDA airborne test data, information, and documentation on the following MDA developed test assets for use in their evaluation/solution: the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) I & II test assets and the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP).  All interface control documents (ICD) for the government furnished equipment (GFE) sensors will also be provided.  Offerors should be registered on FedTeds (https://www.fedteds.gov/) for document access.  Potential offerors must be willing and able to work/interface with foreign nationals as directed by the MDA.

 
Submission Procedures:


Respondents should submit a white paper of a maximum of 25 pages that provides the following information:  

1.	Company name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address.  Company must certify that it is a U.S. business.

2.	Technical approach(es) to meeting MDA's test needs for an airborne optical sensor platform

3.	Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM ) Cost
 
4.	Estimated schedule, with major milestones highlighted, for platform development

5.	Technical, schedule, and cost risk assessments


A briefing package summarizing the white paper is also required with a limit of 20 slides.  Offerors should mark all proprietary data as appropriate.  The responses must be provided in electronic form with the white paper in Microsoft Word format and the briefing in Microsoft PowerPoint format.  


Responses are due no later than July 31, 2007.  MDA Government and contractor support personnel will review all responses.  Responses to the RFI will not be evaluated for any purpose other than determining potential competition and capabilities for the proposed effort.  Any responses not received by the due date will be considered late and therefore will not be considered.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the SPAWAR Chief Engineer is seeking information from interested contractors that could provide automated Test and Evaluation Tools. The tools should allow optimized test planning capability that is traceable to applicable system requirements.  Test planning tools would benefit SPAWAR by providing SPAWAR test engineers a rapid ability to ensure that test plans are identified to applicable system or program requirements. Specifically, test plans can be developed that would maximize test objectives and coverage as well as identify lack of test coverage for test and system planners.  A key facet of the test planning tools would maximize test coverage of system requirments while minimizing test time and resources.

<DESC>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Requ est for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Phlebotomy. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medi cal Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medica l/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with  the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a  contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from dat e of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined are c onsidered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a si ngle vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and  product availability. <BR><BR>Point of Contact<BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR>   <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Phlebotomy, which at a minimum includes the high volume line items below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $37,965. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month p eriod. The top high volume usage lines for this project include:<BR><BR>Needle Blood Collection 21 gauge Eclipse; PKG DESCRIPTION: 48 EA/BX/10 BX/CS; Delivered Qty 178; Extended Price $30,285.<BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR ><BR>C.

All  clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinica l Team intends to conduct the clinical evaluation in a clinical and/or non-clinical The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, i n-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their products. Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The TPRBs support and TAMCs rationale for  in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of Peri Operative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practic es and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide training materials to Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, 1 8th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and the 121 CSH. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional method s that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The clinical repr esentatives, on the TPRB, from NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and  121st CSH opted to exercise this option for the training and guidance of the clinicians who will use the samples. This option is another meth od used to support the government's minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center: Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC clinical staff. One  vendor per week. The TPRB Clinician will coordinate the scheduling and location of the presentations. This individual will work with the vendors in scheduling the training activities. Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the staff. A presentation re viewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance reg arding the product. All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hos pital Guam, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and the 121 CSH. Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation. The Pacific Region TPRB clinical representative, from each of thes e MTFs, will select the appropriate providers for this evaluation. They will proctor and monitor the clinical evaluation process. Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teaching aides provided by a vendor. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be con ducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations, and guidance.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance evaluation criteria have be en established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	The vena-puncture needle is sharp and does not damage skin. (Penetrates skin evenly does not tear skin or leave jagged skin edges)<BR><BR>2.	The safety device does not interfere with the intende d use. (Safety mechanism does not  prevent the introduction of the needle through the skin and vein wall, does not impede the flash back of blood or the blood flow into the collection container.)<BR><BR>3.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, no part of  the needle is accessible. (Once activated, the safety sleeve, sheath or covering completely covers the needle  eliminating potential for reuse of needle)<BR><BR>Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is compl eted and analyzed, all vendors who participated in the clinical/performance evaluation will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Ven dors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) 7th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit i ncentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Regio n reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results be come more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following el ements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor (lin e item review of the current usage in the region against what is being offered). Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR >

<SUBJECT>R -- A-10 Prime Contract
<DESC>1 Nov 07

Government Responses to Industry Comments re: October 2007 RFI


General Response  

The Government appreciates industry comments to clarify or improve the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements for the forthcoming A-10 Prime Follow-On competition. Recommended word, sentence, and paragraph change suggestions to the PWS will be incorporated in the next update if determined prudent by the Government.

Concerning future activity, the Government will release a draft request for proposal (RFP) as part of its ongoing market research.  The draft RFP should be released by 2 November.  An A-10 Prime Follow-on Industry Days will be held at Hill AFB on 28-29 November. Individual one-on-one meetings will also be scheduled upon request during that time. Specific location, times and RSVP requirements will be released at a later date.

Finally, there were several questions posed to the Government in the Oct RFI responses from industry.  The following are short answers to those questions.   

1.  Section 2.2.3 ? states ?provide testing capability in artificial and real-time environments.? Is this intended to mean the contractor will have an A-10 flight simulator and ground maintenance trainers? 

GOVT:  The reference to a ?real-time? testing environment has been deleted from the PWS. 

2.  Section 2.2.3.1 ? states that the contractor ?be capable of supporting flight test requirements.? Is this intended to mean the contractor will have A-10 qualified flight test pilots on staff? 

GOVT:  No, the contractor will not be required to have A-10 flight test pilots on staff. The contractor?s role in flight test support usually includes flight test planning and data analysis.

3.  Sections 2.2.3.2 and 2.2.3.3 ? Does the AF have an A-10 avionics/software integration facility that would be available for contractor use as GFE to support these activities? Does the incumbent have these facilities? 

GOVT:  It is not likely that the current avionics/software integration facility will be available for contract use as it is partially owned by the incumbent and is currently supports ongoing avionics/software development, maintenance and test efforts.  The Government will provide a listing of GFE that is in use by the incumbent and will indicate any duplicate GFE which might be available to another contractor.

4.  The PWS does not clearly state if it is intended for the contractor team to sit on base at OO-ALC or if they expect them to have their own facility.  If it is a contractor facility does it make any difference where they are located? Please state where work is to be performed.

GOVT:  No, it is not necessary that the contractor be physically located at OO-ALC. However, work could be performed at multiple locations, dependent on the nature of the tasking, i.e., development efforts at development facilities, sustainment work performed at OO-ALC or corporate facilities, technical support activities at various field locations, etc. 

5.  There is a large Appendix D with the A-10 WBS but the PWS that does not reference the WBS be used.  It is only implied by its presence.  Will the IMP and IMS CDRLs call for the project to be organized using the A-10 WBS?

GOVT:   Yes, the A-10 WBS in Appendix D, as well as Appendices E & F, will be used for task/delivery orders that produce identifiable work products, whether they are hardware, software, data, facilities, or related services. The PWS will be updated to reflect the use of these documents when required by discrete orders.

6.  Please provide a section on Government Furnished Property (GFP) to include GFE & GFM.  Please include a section on Contractor Furnished Property (CFP) that is required on behalf of the contractor to provide as part of the contract.

GOVT:  The Government will provide a listing of available GFE/GFP/GFM in the data library.   CFP is dependent on the solution proposed by a contractor, which should consider their (or their team?s) capability in addition to the availability of GFP for a particular project. Individual task/delivery orders will address these requirements. 

7.  Recommend that the PWS include a section on ?transition period? and the required timeline that would be associated with the contract developing the transition plans.

GOVT:  It is understood that a contractor may need a transition period after award of this contract to stand up a core body of personnel and resources to prepare for and support efforts which will be placed on this contract.  This process should be reviewed and understood by the Government.  Transition of workload is not anticipated at this time; however any transition, if necessary, will be considered for discrete orders placed on this contract.  Additional recommendations are welcome and this topic can be discussed further during Industry Day, if desired.

8.   Recommend that the PWS include a section on ?Meetings? that includes all of the known planned meetings which will be required throughout the life of the contract.

GOVT:   Program Management Reviews are identified in para 2.2.4.2 of the PWS. Additional programmatic and technical reviews will be identified in individual task/delivery orders.  Additional meetings determined beneficial may also be recommended.

9.  Please provide a public list of contractors interested in partnering/team arrangements.

GOVT:  The A-10 Program Office does not maintain nor distribute lists of contractors. However, the Government will be conducting an Industry Day at the end of November to discuss the Prime follow-on effort. That venue may provide opportunities for those interested in partnering/teaming arrangements.


10.  The terms ?may? and ?may be? are used throughout the PWS. Specific guidance regarding how the USAF would like the contractor to interpret and estimate items where these terms are used is required.

GOVT:   Because this PWS is a broad scoping document, the terms ?may? and ?may be? are used to define the potential of having to perform a task or delivery effort.  In contrast words like ?will? and ?shall? articulate an expected requirement. Specific work will be defined in individual task/delivery orders. 

11. There are cases in the PWS where ?will? is used relative to contractor action or responsibility. It is our plan to interpret these as ?shall?.

GOVT;   We concur with your interpretation.

12.  Will contract clause ?9952.774-H774, Exclusive Subcontract Arrangements (Apr 05),? be used on this contract?

GOVT:  It is the Government?s intention to use this clause in the RFP.

13.  Section 2.2.1.1. Contractor recommends the Government insert SEMP for SEP throughout the PWS.

GOVT:  A recent USD (AT&L) memorandum established systems engineering policy and mandated a Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) for all programs. The use of the term SEMP is no longer used among DOD activities. However, a new CDRL for the SEP has not as of yet been developed. We will provide further guidance as it becomes available.
(See DOD Systems Engineering Preparation Guide, v2, October 2007)

14.  Section 2.2.4.9. Contractor recommends the Government delete ?A/OA-10 Aircraft Security Classification Guide, 31 March 2006? or current version.  

GOVT:  The current Security Classification Guide (SCG) is in force at this time.  A revised SCG is expected to be released later this year.

<SUBJECT>B -- Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program FY 2009, Broad Agency Announcement
<DESC>The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as ?Challenge Proposals? proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that ?challenge? an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas will be considered by DAC for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies: 1). Warfighter enhancements that specifically address improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equipment, combined equipment, longer missions, better batteries). 2). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level); surveillance, tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification). 3). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training). 4.) Other proposals that support our national strategy.  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given special consideration if they address any design, engineering, manufacturing or technology integration issue causing said breach and satisfy all other DAC legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under ?Reference Materials? on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and review panels. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. The acquisition program manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include action as a validation test or a comparative test based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2009 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2008. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil. Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise compensate/ reimburse for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/ submitted via the DAC website NLT 2000 hours EST, 18 February 2008. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore cannot answer submitter questions or accept proposals.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

The reference solicitation number is:  NHLBI-PB(DE)-2008-37-CDM

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 Million.

The acquisition is being conducted as a small business set aside competition total.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541618 associated small business size standard is $6.5 Million.   

The Government?s period of performance is December 2007 - December 2008.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health, National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research, Laboratory of Sensory Biology, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intend to award a purchase order to develop a five-year Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2009-2013.  The Statement of Work is as follows: 

A.	BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION:  As the only Institute of the NIH devoted to dental, oral and craniofacial research, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) has a distinguished record of supporting research to advance the oral health of the nation.  Powerful new research tools and approaches are enhancing NIDCR?s ability to further improve the oral health of the nation.  Achieving NIDCR?s vision of advancing the oral health and well-being for all requires having a comprehensive strategic planning process that identifies the most promising opportunities for investment and delineates the Institute?s priorities.  During the past five years, overall decisions and NIDCR research priorities have been guided by a Strategic Plan that extends through fiscal year 2008.  Having a comprehensive strategic plan that reflects the wisdom and advice of the oral, dental and craniofacial research community as well as the broader network of stakeholders has been an invaluable asset to the Institute.  NIDCR is now poised to begin a new strategic planning process that will culminate with a new Strategic Plan for FY 2009-2013.

B.	PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The NIDCR, Office of the Director (OD) needs to obtain expert professional support in order to develop a new five-year Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2009-2013.  Given NIDCR?s unique role in oral health research, it must address scientific needs and opportunities in a manner that reflects emerging trends in biomedical research and that provide the greatest potential to advance research in the areas that fall within its mission. The NIDCR must engage in the process of developing a new comprehensive, relevant, and dynamic Strategic Plan for 2009-2013 through a focused, inclusive and efficient planning process.
By virtue of the multiple diseases and cross-cutting areas of science represented in NIDCR?s research portfolio, it is essential that the strategic planning process actively engage and obtain input from a range of external scientific organizations and stakeholders that have a keen interest in the Institute?s research.  Also crucially important to the strategic planning process is a means to critically evaluate the Institute?s current research portfolio, and to identify trends and new/emerging areas of scientific and technological inquiry that have the potential to advance oral health research.  Increasingly oral health research is taking a holistic, systems-based perspective that requires participation of researchers from multiple ?non-traditional? disciplines.  As the interface between the traditional ?oral research community? and investigators from new fields such as informatics, engineering, imaging, and genetics continues to expand, it is vital that the strategic planning process integrate the role of that these new disciplines and stakeholders play in moving NIDCR?s research agenda forward.   Therefore, it is crucial that the strategic planning process reach out and engage these ?new? disciplines and stakeholders and incorporate their input in a thoughtful and practical way.  In sum, the NIDCR needs to obtain expert assistance and advice to facilitate the strategic planning process and ensure an effective, productive, and transparent way to engage NIDCR leadership and staff, new and traditional researchers and stakeholders to produce a comprehensive and dynamic Strategic Plan for 2009-2013. The strategic planning process needs to be guided with the recognition of the unique role of the NIDCR in the context of the broader NIH research community and new areas of scientific opportunity.

Statement of Work
National Library of Medicine
Exhibition Program, History of Medicine Division
Request for Quotations for Hardware Integration and Support Services


1) BACKGROUND

Exhibition Program History

The Exhibition Program at the National Library of Medicine produces exhibitions about the cultural and social history of science, medicine, and technology for installation in the Library's lobby and rotunda galleries.  On-site exhibitions are produced every two years. 


The on-site exhibitions feature books, journals, photographs, prints, and media from the Library's collections and borrowed from institutions and individuals.


The Library is committed to exploring new technologies within the exhibition environment.


The Exhibition Program sometimes produces exhibitions that travel which are based on the content of the on-site installations and may include graphics and media.  Traveling exhibitions are not expected to include artifacts but may include media and hardware. 


To view the websites of past exhibition projects please go to http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/exhibition.html for more information.


Library On-Site Exhibition Space


The exhibition spaces at the National Library of Medicine have been adapted from their original purposes. 


The first area that visitors encounter is the Library lobby area. This is an open, non-obstructed approximately 40' x 40' space with a 14' ceiling with fluorescent and track lighting, terrazzo floors, and marble walls. This area is used to introduce visitors to the exhibition but does not house displays or contain significant content. Access to the rotunda gallery space is through two sets of glass doors. 


The rotunda is approximately 64' x 72' and was previously used to house the reference desk and old card catalogue room. It is a multi-storied space with second story offices called the Mezzanine, running around the perimeter of the rotunda. The roof sits atop a bank of skylights. The space has a carpeted, raised tile floor that provides space and access for running electric and computer cables allowing access to power and LAN lines (total power is limited to 20 amps). Patrons and staff require access to the rotunda from all four sides.


Any traffic pattern developed for the exhibition needs to provide staff and patrons with clear, easy and accessible access and emergency egress to reading room, elevators, stairs, corridors, offices, etc.


2) PURPOSE AND OBJECTS OF THE PROCUREMENT

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain professional creative, technical, and support services to develop, implement, and maintain the hardware infrastructure required to deliver exhibition related media under the leadership of the National Library of Medicine's Exhibition Program staff and the Head of the Exhibition Program. Exhibition projects often require the work of several vendors working as a Creative Services Team and the successful Offeror will be expected to be a part of this team.  The Creative Services Team will work together to develop an exhibition experience that integrates all elements - static, graphic, multimedia, etc.


The Exhibition Program anticipates awarding a purchase order to 1 Offeror. The vendor will be determined by the overall technical evaluation scores earned by the proposals.

<DESC>Statement of Work

	The Library of Congress film preservation laboratory, Packard Campus has a requirement for a motion picture color proof printer and comparator system.  The Library of Congress intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with The Hollywood Film Company. This equipment is used to selectively print individual frames of a color motion picture (Proof Printer), then project them back as individual frames (Comparator) so that the film can be evaluated for color balance, exposure, and other technical qualities. The use of this equipment significantly reduces the amount of testing required to achieve the proper look of a color film, resulting in a significant savings of film stock, chemicals, and staff time to the Library. 

The Proof Printer and Comparator system should be delivered to the Film Preservation Laboratory at the Library of Congress NAVCC Packard Campus. The manufacturing lead time for the equipment is a minimum of seven (7) months from time of order. The manufacturer should deliver, install, test, and certify for operation the system within one (1) month of delivery. The period of performance is nine months from date of award.


Once the equipment is manufactured and tested at the factory, it will be delivered to the Film Preservation Laboratory in Culpeper. Once delivered, uncrated, and inspected for shipping damage, it will be placed in at its designated location. Within 1 month of delivery, the manufacturer will install, test, and certify the system for operation. The staff of the Lab will test the system, confirm the certification and operability. 

Interested parties may forward their intentions to the Contracting Specialist (CS) on or before 12/26/07 in the form of a proposal.  Questions may also be emailed to the CS.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<BR><BR>QUESTION.  Can Fork Bliss off load the containers from a flat bed truck.  ANSWER.  Yes.  QUESTION.  Do the containers need to be certified as cargo worthy.  ANSWER.<BR>I  do not know what cargo worthy means.  They must be  able to store cargo.  Can the containers be used, or do you need new, one time used containers.  ANSWER.  Either one is acceptable.  QUESTION.  On the above solicitation, will the end user have off-loading capabilities.  ANSWER.  Yes.  QUESTION.  Would yo u consider steel building materials that come with complete instructions to Fabricate the storage building on-site.  ANSWER.  No.  QUESTION.  How many do you need?  ANSWER.  Please refer to the combined synopsis/solicitation for the quantity required.  QUE STION.  What size do you need?  ANSWER.  Please refer to the combined synopsis/solicitation for the dimensions.  QUESTION.  When do you need them.  ANSWER.  Please refer to the combined synopsis/solicitation for the delivery date.  QUESTION.  Regarding sol icitation T-A021 for 20 ea. 8 x 20 containers, wood floor, tan color, is the required for NEW containers or USED containers.  ANSWER.  Either one is acceptable.  QUESTION.  Our concern is that the solicitation due date is December 13, 2007 which does not  necessarily mean it will be awarded this date and that the material must be on site no later than January 2nd 2008.  With 2 holidays in this time frame, in such a relatively short amount of delivery time already, I do not feel that anyone will be able to meet the timetable given the specifications of the solicitation.  25  30 calendar days FROM AWARD DATE is a more realistic timeline.  If the time of delivery could be moved to the week ending Jan 18 it would be doable.  ANSWER.  Please refer to the combin ed synopsis/solicitation for the delivery date.  QUESTION.  We are a large business and would like to bid on this SOL#:W911SG-08-T-A021.  It stated this is for small business set aside and I wanted to know if I can bid on this as we are a large business.

We have 8W x 20L x 86H chemical  storage buildings but I need to know what is being stored inside it so I can make sure the unit will be constructed to meet the regulations of the products being stored.  ANSWER.  The acquisition is for storage containers, which will store soldier belongi ngs.  QUESTION.  Does both the contractor submitting the quote and their container supplier have to be registered small businesses.  ANSWER.

Please access FEDBIZOPPS by  https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi .   QUESTION.  I was trying to see whether or not this solicitation can be sole sourced.  ANSWER.
