<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Small-Overlap Frontal Crashworthiness </strong></p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to make an award, on a sole-source basis, to Electricore Inc. to "Small-Overlap Frontal Crashworthiness", during the period of August 22, 2013 to July 21, 2014.</p>
<p>NHTSA has been issuing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) for the last thirty years. <span style="COLOR: #0070c0"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>EPCA requires DOT to establish average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks at "the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary [of DOT] decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When setting "maximum feasible" fuel economy standards, DOT is required to "consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was enacted on December 19, 2007 and amended EPCA by mandating, in addition to passenger car and light truck standards being set at the maximum feasible level in each model year, that the model year (MY) 2011-2020 CAFE standards be set sufficiently high to ensure that the industry-wide average of all new passenger cars and light trucks, combined, is not less than 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by MY 2020.</p>

Recently IIHS announced a new test protocol for vehicle small overlap (SOL) frontal crashworthiness testing. This test is conducted at 40 +/- 0.6 mph and 25 +/- 1 percent overlap. In response to this new test, automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have to redesign and strengthen vehicle structure, especially at the front of the vehicle so that it can achieve a good rating. Because SOL was just announced recently, many OEMs are coming up with counter-measures in between redesigns using a "bandage" solution instead of a fully redesigned and integrated solution. The amount of vehicle weight change needs to be decided, i</span>f a vehicle is fully redesigned with the safety countermeasures optimized and integrated into the new vehicle structure.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">The newly announced small overlap test has the potential of adding weight to vehicle which is against the trend of vehicle light weighting as used in CAFE rulemaking analyses. NHTSA needs to understand how much vehicle weight will be changed due to the SOL test requirement and the associated cost to stay informed of the new industry trend. The work performed under this contract shall be based on the work performed under contract DTNH22-11-C-00193, i.e. using the FEA and cost models developed in that contract and updating the design with countermeasures for the new IIHS SOL test.</p>

The work to maintain this system has been performed by Rees Scientific Corporation (RSC) since the initial installation of the freezer monitoring system in 2006 under the following previous acquisitions:<br />Contract Number Period of Performance Vendor<br />HHSN268201000076P 01/13/2010 - 01/12/2013 Rees Scientific Corp.<br />HHSN268200800099P 11/01/2007 - 10/31/2010 Rees Scientific Corp.
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance will consist of a twelve (12) month base period followed by two (02) consecutive twelve (12) twelve month option periods.<br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />This is a follow-on requirement, wherein the contractor shall provide a hardware and software maintenance agreement on a Rees Centron SQL monitoring system located in Building 30 of the main NIH campus (9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892). This agreement includes the following:<br /><br />&bull; Annual On-Site IQ/OQ Validation<br />&bull; Current Software Validation Manual<br />&bull; Software updates to current version (2.0 build 1015)<br />&bull; Calibration of all temperature &amp; humidity sensors with NIST traceable device<br />&bull; On-Site training at the time of validation<br />&bull; 24/7/365 telephone technical support<br />&bull; On-site service that includes new parts and labor</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform scheduled checks of the system, including updating the computer system software, which controls the alarm system, and provide 24/7/365 tech support, and issue a service technician should the system require repair.<br />Task 1: Perform annual validation, calibration, and maintenance of existing system setup. The contractor shall review and check all system panels and ports. Maintenance shall include software updates, annual measurements of system functionality and connection status. Provide alarm alerts and means of obtaining graphical reports and all other needs commonly associated with environmental management.<br />Task 2: Provide 24 hours per day and seven days per week monitoring of the equipment associated with the alarm system by a technical support group. During an emergency, the RSC technician(s) usually be on site within 4-Hours with the rare exception where new parts are required from the factory. <br />Task 3: Contractor shall perform an annual Installation Qualification/Operational Qualification test of the freezer alarm system in Bldg #30. Contractor shall perform onsite training and all system inputs will be verified and calibrated.<br />Other considerations:<br />1. All current Rees Scientific warranties would be void if services were performed by non-authorized service providers.<br />2. Contractor must provide proof from Rees Scientific Corporation that it has legal access to RSC software licenses and must be supplied during service and upgrades. <br />3. Contractor must also supply only new hardware components/modules (including V.2 Wireless 2.4 GHz transmitters). <br />4. Annual maintenance must also include the latest software release from RSC at the time of validation. Currently this release is Centron SQL Software version 2.0 build 1015. "No exceptions will be accepted".<br />Deliverables:<br />Current Software Validation Manual and latest software release: Centron SQL Version 2.0 build 1015.<br /><br />JUSTIFICATION<br />Rees Scientific Corp. is the sole manufacturer of the Rees Centron SQL monitoring system hardware and software installed in Bldg #30. The software that runs the monitoring system is proprietary to Rees Scientific Corp as they are the developers and own the source code. No other companies have software rights or are authorized by Rees Scientific to work on their systems. Upgrading of software is included in the proposed contract and must be done by Rees Scientific in order to maintain product warranty. Current Version is 2.0 Build 1015.<br /><br />Due to the proprietary nature of the system, which includes software updates, new replacement parts, licenses, and patents covering the intricate designs of the instruments, no other known sources are authorized or possess the knowledge necessary to maintain and validate the monitoring system. <br />There are currently no other manufacturers and resellers of this service. The product requiring maintenance can not be replaced without another expensive investment in product analysis, transfer, installation, and implementation. The cost and time required for a new manufacturer to install a new system is not in the best interest of the government. <br /><br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY<br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1(b), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 811219 and the Size Standard is $19.0M. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a noncompetitive, sole source basis for a hardware software maintenance agreement to Rees Scientific Corporation is based upon the market research conducted in accordance with one or more of the techniques specified in FAR Part 10-Market Research, Subpart 10.002(b)(2). Any information received as a result of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.<br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability for any future competitive procurement by responding to this notice in writing, no later than March 11, 2013, 9:30 a.m., EST. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement. All responses must reference this pre-solicitation / notice of intent number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2013-082-RMD and may be submitted electronically to the Contracting Specialist at Dougherr@nih.gov or by mail to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Renee Dougherty.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to procure and award on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, a firm fixed price contract for a Dynamically Adaptive Secure Computer Area Network (DASCAN) system with integrated Naval Unified Targeting System (NUTS) application from Computer Systems Center, Inc. (CSCI), Springfield, VA.  

OPNAV N2/N6 has tasked NAWCWD to demonstrate NUTS functionality as part of a VMU Tactical Operations Center (TOC) user evaluation during Marine Aviation Weapons Tactics Squadron (MAWTS) Weapons Tactics Instructor (WTI) exercise 1-13. The Contractor shall provide configuration management and documentation of the baseline DASCAN system with a certified interoperable NUTS application.
  The DASCAN system, to include FMV/I data receipt, processing, and bandwidth-dependent FMV distribution module and C2/metadata synchronization module, will provide full metadata interfaces so as to enable NUTS demonstration within the MAWTS exercise environment. Leveraging current DASCAN Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) and Defense Security Service (DSS) IA certifications, the Contractor will verify certified interoperability, maintain configuration controls, and deliver certification documentation.

No other company has an existing system that will satisfy the Government's requirement.  Therefore, it would create a substantial duplication of cost to develop and certify a new system.
  Since the demonstration is expected to be a one-time event, the additional cost could not be recovered in subsequent competitions.

Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division plans to enter into an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a maximum six month performance with Scientific Applications International Corporation (SAIC), 10260 Campus Point, San Diego, CA 92121.
  It is anticipated that Fixed Price Level of Effort (FPLOE) task orders will be issued as required for a continuation of training and training support of classroom training, equipment maintenance on Small Arms Weapons, Ground Based Operational Surveillance System (GBOSS) and Night Vision Devices, Joint Counter Radio Electronic Counter-measures (JCREW), Remote Operated Small Arms Mounts (ROSAM), SEA Protector MK50, 30MM Gun System MK46, Coast Guard VAS systems, and Naval Expeditionary Combat Command small craft and support systems.  This support will include report generation, logistics documentation, training plan development and updates, training curriculum/documentation development and update, technical manual development and updates, maintenance documentation development and updates, development of presentation material and newsletters, system maintenance/troubleshooting and software development and updates for classroom training equipment.
  It will also include the development of computer based training media for use in an E-Learning environment and Instructor training for sponsors as requested.

This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is to prevent an unacceptable lapse in the technical support of critical systems.  This requirement plays a central role in the Navys combat mission.  Any interruption in deliveries and support of these critical projects would result in reduced warfighter effectiveness due to loss of full mission capability.  SAIC is the only vendor capable of continuing to provide the Navy with uninterrupted training and technical support on the required systems.
    

A formal solicitation will not be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested entities may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Direct questions to Mr. Terrell Turner by e-mail; terrell.turner1@navy.mil (preferred) or by phone 812-854-2780.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to procure a Heavy Duty 4-Wheel Drive Dynamometers.   This acquisition will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.
EPA is undertaking a comprehensive program to enhance its capability to conduct low level emissions testing of the highest precision and accuracy at its NVFEL facility in  Ann Arbor, Michigan.  As a result of the Renewable Fuel Standards program, increased emphasis will be placed on testing vehicles operated on renewable fuels.  Other enhancements will enable performance of both cold-temperature and air conditioning testing.
The full Statement of Work (SOW), which will be included in the solicitation, describes the engineering and operational requirements for chassis dynamometers that will be required for implementing these enhanced capabilities.  The equipment implementation described in the full SOW is comprised of a four-wheel dynamometer for a new Heavy Duty Vehicle Facility being built at NVFEL. The agency intends to issue an award for a 4WD dynamometer to be delivered and accepted within 18 months after the date of contract award.
Federal regulations for exhaust emissions and fuel economy of motor vehicles specify tests using chassis dynamometers.  The purpose of the chassis dynamometer is to duplicate the forces encountered by a vehicle moving on a road by modeling those characteristics with a stationary vehicle on a rotating surface.  The dynamometer specified in the full SOW will provide EPA with additional testing capabilities to support both current and future regulations as well as a range of evaluation and development activities.  This dynamometer will be used to test a wide range of vehicles including front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, four wheel drive and all wheel drive with the full range of powertrain technology including those providing energy conservation through regenerative braking.  These vehicles will include those powered by some combination of internal combustion engines, electric motors and storage devices, hydraulics and hydraulic storage systems, and fuel cells.
The dynamometers shall incorporate the following general features for testing these vehicles:
Accurate and precise road load determination and simulation, utilizing the latest technology, through a digitally-controlled, electrically-activated, motor-absorber that recreates the mechanical inertia and frictional forces that would be present on the road with electrically generated load forces based on specific equations, coefficients and response characteristics.
Vehicle loading applied to the tires by 72" diameter rolls connected to intermediate motor/absorbers on a per axle or pair of axles configuration that contacts each vehicle tire.
Capability of testing complete Heavy Duty Vehicles up to 80,000 GVW on any of the following: EPA UDDS for Heavy Duty Vehicles, New York Composite, New York Bus, Orange County Bus, EUDC or NEDC cycles. Capable of controlling acceleration rate 6.0 MPH/second for 20,000 to 54,000 lbm GVW inertia weight (IW) simulation and 4.0 MPH/second for 54,000 to 80,000 lbm GVW IW, in either two wheel drive or four wheel drive configurations.  Vehicle testing shall be accomplished by simulating all load conditions that the vehicle can experience on a dry smooth road.  Hence, the roll sets shall operate with synchronous speeds in order to simulate conditions that would reasonably occur on the road.
The chassis dynamometer shall conform to the requirements specified in the full SOW.  For the equipment specified, the Contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff.  The Contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.
Award will be made on a ?Best Value? basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important that price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed dynamometer to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant corporate experience.  The solicitation will be posted on the EPA website on or about March 19, 2013.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal referencing which shall be considered by the agency.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Gerold Young, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487 2660, or e mail at young.gerold@epa.gov.   Questions must be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via e-mail.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<p>The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities of C2, sensor and weapon systems. These systems are deployed on a variety of platforms and users, both manned and unmanned, operating under challenging battlefield conditions (lack of infrastructure, mobility, spectrum, interference, multipath, atmospherics, size/weight/power constraint, etc.) in different environments (space, terrestrial and undersea). The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Code 312 is to overcome these challenges by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance end-to-end connectivity and quality-of-service for mission-critical information exchange among such widely dispersed naval, joint, and coalition forces. The vision is to provide high throughput, robust communications and networking to ensure all warfighters -- from the operational command to the tactical edge -- have access to the data, information, and resources necessary to make timely, accurate decisions while performing their assigned missions or tasks.</p>
<p>Objective and Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>Proposals for potential FY14 Exploratory Development/Applied Research (Budget category 6.2) projects are sought under the following focus areas:</p>
<p>1. Low-profile conformal multi-band (e.g., X/Ku/Ka) multi-beam digital phased array antennas with reduced beam squint and low side lobes and scan loss;</p>
<p>2. Transformative concepts/designs (arrays, waveform, signal processing etc.) to enhance performance and aperture size/power efficiency in high bandwidth troposcatter communications;</p>
<p>3. Passive wavelength filter technologies for the 450-550 nm blue-green underwater communications receiver (band-pass widths as applicable to a variety of laser/LED sources), with wide field-of-view (&gt; +-20 degrees), low insertion loss and high isolation;</p>
<p>4. Innovative concepts and approaches for spectrum co-existence (underlay/overlay, spatio-temporal/spectral management and deconfliction) of military waveforms with commercial wireless communications;</p>
<p>5. Dynamic network (traffic) scheduling, throughput and robustness enhancement codes/algorithms/protocols under nonstationary channel conditions; and</p>
<p>6. Machine learning algorithm/protocol and techniques for autonomous network management</p>
<p>ONR is also receptive to highly innovative ideas in other general communications and networking areas that are not within the designated focus areas above, but nonetheless are important to the Navy/Marine Corps, as determined under the synopsis section above.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice to Interested Parties - This posting is a request for information only and does not constitute a formal request for proposal from B&amp;W Pantex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BACKGROUND<br />The Pantex Plant, located 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas, is charged with securing America by providing the nation's nuclear deterrent. The facility is managed and operated by Babcock and Wilcox Technical Services Pantex, LLC (B&amp;W PANTEX) for the United States Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA). The Pantex Plant supports four core missions: 1) National Security, 2) Nuclear Explosive Operations, 3) Nuclear Material Operations, and 4) High Explosive Operations. Daily operations involve work with nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship, plutonium pit storage, high explosives work, engineering, safety, security, facilities management, quality, environmental protection, and general administration. For purposes of achieving core mission objectives and in managing the Pantex Plant, B&amp;W Pantex relies heavily on the usage of outside subcontractors and suppliers to provide necessary support services to Plant operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">STATED OBJECTIVE<br />To better support the procurement needs at Pantex Plant, B&amp;W Pantex is seeking to expand its vendor database of suppliers having construction and general contracting expertise. As Pantex Plant is a nuclear facility, we specifically seek suppliers who are ASME NQA-1 2008 qualified and who meet the standard quality assurance requirements for nuclear facility applications. This standard provides requirements and guidelines for the establishment and execution quality assurance programs during siting, design, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. This standard reflects industry experience and current understanding of the quality assurance requirements necessary to achieve safe, reliable, and efficient utilization of nuclear energy, and management and processing of radioactive materials. The standard focuses on the achievement of results, emphasizes the role of the individual and line management in the achievement of quality, and fosters the application of these requirements in a manner consistent with the relative importance of the item or activity.</p>

<p>Guidelines consist of various letters of authorization and memoranda of understanding between the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan, as well as existing federal regulations, Department of State policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account.</p>
<p>Complexity The incumbent is required to perform assignments involving varied projects and uniquely complex cases, requiring the application of many different and unrelated processes, procedures, and criteria. These assignments may include such varied type personnel security clearance requirements as Presidential clearances under E.O. 10450 and E.O. 12968 for Foreign Service and General Schedule employees. The incumbent must make recommendations on assigned actions which routinely present issues of complexity and sensitivity because of such reasons as material incompleteness or inconclusiveness of vital investigative data; conflicting requirements; the controversial nature of the reported acts, behavior or affiliations; the need to apply differing investigative, standards and criteria; the nexus of the proposed assignment/duties to the information of security concern; or the unusual prominence, high rank or stature of the individuals involved. The resolution of frequently conflicting, and always volatile and controversial issues and the exacting nature of the process of judging investigative sufficiency requires trained judgment and expertise.</p>
<p>Physical Demands The work is sedentary and is usually accomplished while the employee is comfortably seated at a desk or table. It requires carrying light objects such as files and papers. Special physical qualifications are not required.</p>
<p><br />D. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />(Need to know what the evaluation elements are that will be utilized by the technical evaluation board for the selection of the applicant for this position. Generally this is 4 or 5 statements of requirements that the board members will utilize for scoring the application. Each criteria should be weighted a percentage that the total percentage of the entire evaluation will equal 100%)</p>
<p>Factor 1. Offeror's demonstrated experience as a recognized authority in security management programs and issues. This includes experience that may have involved analytical, planning, advisory, operational or evaluative duties for the purpose of developing and implementing security policies, procedures, and standards for appropriate systems of internal management controls in the design, development, and evaluation of protection systems and devices, and the ability to monitor all INL sponsored and directed activities in support of counternarcotics, anticrime, and/or civilian policing activities within the US and at overseas facilities.

<p>Factor 3. Offeror's demonstrated experience as a manager, coordinating with appropriate security management personnel of a large government agency or private security organization, and having extensive interaction with other offices/groups both within and outside the parent organization.

Experience would display applicant's ability to manage/evaluate the full-range of program resources, establish and maintain project schedules, and to deal with issues related to projects of sufficient complexity, i.e., those which require extensive coordination and management such as requiring interaction with task forces convened to meet the needs of specific critical programs. (20 points)</p>
<p>Factor 4. Offeror's ability to interact with others in order to represent the Bureau's interests as a technical expert, both within and outside the Department.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources. Only small business sources shall respond to this sources sought synopsis.
<p><br />Project Title: Training and Instructional Services</p>
<p>Project Description: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a continuing need to train its field and headquarters personnel to be knowledgeable of the laws and regulations, scientific concepts and standards related to FDA-regulated program areas. The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) is one of the FDA's Field and Headquarters inspection components that works to achieve compliance of regulated products through inspections, outbreak investigators and responses to emergencies involving regulated products and affecting the public health. FDA- regulated products currently include, but are not limited to: Foods (Manufactured, Retail, Shellfish and Milk), Feed, Biologics, Drugs, Devices, Tobacco, Radiological Health, Laboratory, Veterinary Medicine, Emergency Response and other multi-program areas under the Agency's authority. The purpose of this project is to obtain the services of one or more contractors to supply necessary and qualified personnel capable of providing instructional services or curriculum development for training courses for FDA-regulated products. There should be sufficient personnel and capacity to provide multiple instructional and developmental services simultaneously throughout the year, as over 200 classroom courses are being delivered across the nation to FDA's regulatory stakeholders. During the year, course content is being developed, updated and/or blended for other mediums for delivery, such as online courses or webinars, as needed, to meet the growing needs of FDA. FDA instructors, Project Officers and/or other resource persons will be used as monitors, proctors, and instructors in the program area, as their expertise is considered necessary by FDA to manage course development and delivery. Specific dates and number of courses, by commodity or in total, are subject to change, but will be confirmed annually and adjusted as necessary throughout the year. Course participants and FDA instructors will be traveling in from around the country, and the cost, availability and feasibility of air travel, ground transportation and lodging to attend the course are relevant factors for consideration. The number of courses offered per year will be based on training needs as dictated by ORA's Division of Resource Development (DHRD), and upon the availability of funding, in the range of 4 to 8 courses expected per year, per contractor (depending on how many awards are made). Course Advisory Group (CAG) and other meetings regarding tasks and deliverables shall be conducted at facilities in the Continental United States (CONUS), or via conference calls or webinars selected by FDA/ORA. Classroom Training will be delivered within the United States and its Territories, and, on rare occasions, travel may be non-CONUS with consent from FDA/DHRD. The Contractor may suggest location(s) for material development based on needs.</p>
<p>Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 15 pages (font size Times New Roman 11 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted (but not in place of the responses to the below questions). The anticipated period of performance is 12 months, plus four 12-month option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and must respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? <br />2. Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? <br />3.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requirement for a Protein Crystallization Liquid Handling Robot with three (3) 1-year Post-Warranty Maintenance Options.
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability and capability of Small Business Manufacturers or Small Businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The protein crystallization liquid handling robot will be used in the lab for X-ray crystallographic structure determination of various proteins involved in the neutralization of hepatitis C virus (HCV). This FDA mission-related research project will facilitate the development of an effective HCV-specific immune globulin (HCIGIV) product and an effective HCV vaccine, as well as the establishment of an assay for evaluating and monitoring the potency of future HCIGIV products during clinical trials.</p>
<p>Background<br />An understanding of the structural basis of antibody-mediated virus neutralization is critical for immune prophylaxis and treatment of viral diseases. CBER is interested in the development of an effective immune globulin product and an effective vaccine directly against hepatitis C virus (HCV). A major effort in the lab focuses on the crystallization and X-ray crystallographic structure determination of the viral antigens, in complex with either neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies. The elucidation of the structural features of the antigen/antibody complex will help in designing vaccines that elicit neutralizing antibodies, while avoiding non-neutralizing antibody production. One of the most important and challenging steps towards attaining this goal is to produce protein crystals. Performing protein crystallization screening experiments manually is time consuming and labor intensive. Often times, it requires setting up over one thousand different conditions, if not more, to obtain a single crystal-producing hit.</p>
<p>Scope <br />To obtain a liquid handling robot specifically designed for protein crystallization that fulfills Dr. Zhang's lab research needs and expedites progress of their research.</p>
<p>Work Requirements<br />Technical Requirements:<br />The system must be able to perform fast and reliable protein crystallization screening experiments. See the following technical requirements:<br />Device shall use new disposable pipette tips for each action to ensure absolutely no cross contamination.<br />Device shall meet the following dimensions (L x W x H): 1600mm x 500mm x 700mm.<br />Instrument shall be able to handle volumes as small as 50 nL to 1.2 &mu;L with great precision and reliability, an important factor for using robot for crystallization.<br />Instrument shall be capable of dispensing viscous solutions such as glycerol and polyethylene glycol, the two reagents which are frequently used in protein crystallization experiments.<br />Device shall have capability to automate all the popular protein crystallization techniques: hanging drop, sitting drop, micro-batch as well as additive screening plate preparation, without the need to make set-up changes to the instrument. <br />Device interface shall have "user-friendly" software for programming a protocol to run a specific screening experiment. <br />Device shall operate at room temperature and in the 4 &ordm;C cold room.<br />Instrument shall have ability to accommodate different/multiple crystallization plate formats.<br />Device shall include scientific computer, monitor, and software.<br />Instrument shall include delivery, installation, training and one year warranty,</p>

<p>TO: ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS</p>
<p>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 234792 - RADAR WIND PROFILER</p>
<p>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) seeks information to begin planning for the purchase of two (2) Radar Wind Profilers for the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation measurement (ARM) Program. The ARM program currently has seven radar wind profilers (RWPs) in operation world-wide with four sites in at the Southern Great Plains (SGP), one at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) and two with the ARM Mobile Facilities (AMF1, AMF2). This network provides a continuous depiction of atmospheric profiles of wind speed and direction to 3-6 km or more in clear air conditions and profiles of water/particle fall speed to as high as 14 km during precipitation. These data can also be used to estimate the height of the mixed layer within the planetary boundary layer as well as stratified stable layers. Six of the current systems are limited to 5 pre-defined pointing positions, from which the horizontal wind profile is calculated based on the geometry of those beams. The seventh, located with AMF2, is capable of beam steering for ship deployments.<br /><br />The ARM program is currently developing two new sites that require wind profilers. One site is at Oliktok Point in Alaska, where a 915 MHz system similar to those presently located at Barrow, AK and SGP is envisaged. However the program will also entertain proposals using other frequencies such as 449 MHz, if they can provide near-surface coverage similar to that presently achievable with 915 MHz systems.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is not a solicitation for bids, proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to deliver and integrate a potential requirement. The responses received from interested contractors will assist the Government in determining the appropriate service required and will help determine the most appropriate acquisition method. This RFI is for Dust Survey of Baxter 1 automated dispensing units.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Acquisition Center (NAC) is seeking information from contractors regarding the capabilities and system performance for a Dust Survey of its Baxter 1 automated dispensing unit. The Contractor will have all equipment and supplies to perform up to 20 samples and one field blank for inhalable dust using an IOM sampler this will be limited to 10 samples per day so the industrial hygienists on site may take detailed works note to supplement the analytical data. This will be done over the course of 3 shifts. Two 6 channel laser particle counters will be used by the industrial hygienists to continuously measure the airborne concentrations of dust in the 0.3um, 0.5um, 1.0um and greater ranges. This will be used as part of the task analysis to identify particularly dusty drugs or processes. Samples that have detectable dust will have additional analysis performed to identify if any compounds are present on the filter. The choice of compounds to analyze will be made by the results of the real time laser particle analysis showing which Pharmaceuticals produced the most dust during the sampling. Samples will be shipped under proper chain of custody to an AIHA accredited laboratory for analysis of dust by weight. Based on these results the samples will be held for possible testing. The contractor shall provide a final close-out report, documenting the results of the sampling and any further testing or periodic sampling or review that may be necessary.
Interested parties are encouraged to submit their capabilities and any descriptive service literature to explain their company, products provided, and any past performance information in relation to Dust survey's conducted. Information shall be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 22 March 2013.

<DESC>TITLE: FA4809-13-T-0007, Sole Source Acquisition to Establish Preventive Maintenance Agreement for Vindicator/VICADS Security System<br /><br />The 4th Contracting Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Open Roads Consulting, Inc (ORCI). Requirement is to establish a Preventive Maintenance Agreement for maintenance and repairs for the Vindicator/VICADS Security System at Seymour Johnson AFB. The reason for this sole source is to prevent a lapse in coverage. After the completion of this bridge a follow on contract will be competed. <br /><br />This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 8 March 2013 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 12 March 2013. For information regarding this purchase, please contact 1Lt Aaron Velasco at (919) 722-1674 or TSgt Ian Buschmann at (919) 722-1753.
<p>APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award a contract for six (6) months to secure the safety and protection of SJAFB's personnel and assets utilizing ORCI. ORCI is currently performing the services under contract number FA4809-07-M-R017. The contract is currently in the six-month extension period and was extended from its original expiration date of 16 Sep 2012 to 16 Mar 2013 as the Government anticipated the services on SJAFB to be satisfied by an Air Force-wide contract awarded in June 2012; however, terminated shortly thereafter. The need for Vindicator/VICADS/CCTV with Object Video Security System maintenance via a contract still exists. Currently, ORCI is the only firm that has access to SJAFB's secured network and required certifications to work the on-site equipment already in place, to perform mission critical services, without generating a lapse in service. Awarding a competitive contract for six (6) months to another contractor would result in a substantial duplication of mobilization costs, equipment costs, and other start-up costs that would not be recovered through full and open competition due the excessively short period of performance that any other firm would have to amortize these costs over. Also, permitting base network access to a company for a limited scheduled service potentially comprises operational security (OPSEC) and information security (INFOSEC). ORCI is the only firm that can perform without a mobilization/start-up period which would result in delays or no preventive or corrective maintenance services for SJAFB. The Government does not have the personnel, materials or equipment that would be required to perform this service. The lack of maintenance and repair services to SJAFB's security system would place installation personnel, critical equipment and infrastructure at an unacceptable risk. A bridge contract will ensure the paramount continuation of service and provide the four to six month lead-time to process a competitive acquisition for a follow on contract.</p>

<CONTACT>M. Forbes, Contract Specialist, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov - G. Huffman, Contracting Officer, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC><p>The Bureau of Fiscal Services (BPD), on behalf of the Financial Management Services (FMS) intends to issue an order to Deloitte Consulting LLC on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 8.405-6 (b)(1), for Identity Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) subject matter expertise to assist FMS' IBM Tivoli Identity Management (ITIM) developers and engineers with the (ITIM) full automation of user provisioning and security consulting services encompassing ICAM and related reporting.</p>
<p>Since April of 2005, Deloitte has provided FMS with guidance and subject matter expertise surrounding its Identity Credentialing and Access Management program and a broad range of security and privacy services. Given the scope and timeline of services sought, the vendor's comprehensive knowledge of the current ICAM architecture, and more specifically IBM's Tivoli Identity Manager (ITIM), Deloitte is in the distinctive position of being able to perform critical time sensitive tasks within the targeted constrained time period without delay. Deloitte resources understand FMS' environment, culture, business and technical processes. Therefore this vendor is uniquely capable of providing the technical subject matter expertise around FMS' ITIM implementation and ICAM related inter-dependencies such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Requirements gathering (business and technical), architecture/design and implementation and support of the enterprise-wide Identity Management solution utilizing ITIM and CA SiteMinder, to include core objective of extending ITIM and legacy FMS' PIV Data Synchronization (PDS) to Legacy BPD;<br />&bull; Maintaining standardization of an Identity Management framework upon which logical application access can be requested, approved, and granted; and enablement of password management services (self-service, forgot password, expirations, and service desk lock/unlock); and management of LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol and Active Directory groups;<br />&bull; Full implementation of an advanced PIV Data Synchronization (PDS) Integration of FMS' (Fiscal Service) ITIM system with USAccess/HRConnect (HRC) at GSA; and technical implementation of LACS (logical access control) &amp; PACS (physical access control) in accordance with Department of Treasury's FICAM (Federal Identity Credentialing and Access Management) Roadmap. Rare and specialized expertise of assembly line development using ITDI (IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator) as well as construction and integration of cloud-based web services, all in the furtherance of the PDS integrated solution and other application implementations;<br />&bull; Guidance and support on adherence to FICAM, NSTIC, NIST guidance, HSPD-12 directives and<br />&bull; Continued support for our ongoing HSPD-12 initiatives (Federation, PIV, PIV-I, and PKI, etc.);<br />&bull; Continued tier-3 assistance and Production support with the historical and technical knowledge of legacy FMS, legacy BPD and TWAI infrastructure and processes, along with the integration challenges that are continually arising from these areas<br />&bull; Expertise and proven track record of overcoming complex technical design challenges by offering solutions that are standardized enough to meet industry standards and EICAM practices, yet flexible enough to accommodate unique application-specific requirement nuances;<br />&bull; Continued demonstration of advanced knowledge of FMS' infrastructure solutions including Websphere, Siteminder, Load Balancers, LDAP, Unix and Microsoft operating systems, all crucial for successful implementation in a highly integrated environmentWith the benefit of Deloitte's expertise in the ICAM security arena and its support efforts to date, FMS has successfully:<br />&bull; Established an advanced enterprise-wide identity and access management solution with full delegated &amp; self-administration capabilities, all within a common provisioning solution framework;<br />&bull; Engineered a robust provisioning solution, scalable for expansion throughout FMS, to include consolidation of three disparate, geographically dispersed provisioning solutions into one, significantly increasing the number of managed systems (600+ UNIX systems) and infrastructure (Active Directory, Lotus Notes, LDAP and various PACS) components with less development and engineering effort;<br />&bull; Automated On-Boarding &amp; Maintenance of Employees and Contractors; Automated synchronization and consistency in data between HRC, ITIM, PACS with HRC being the authoritative source; Elimination of manual feeds for ITIM and for PACS;<br />&bull; Automated business process of Recertification; provided extensive self-service capabilities, delegated approvals and administration capabilities to individual's best suited to perform the functions;<br />&bull; Guided FMS in complying with IT Security standards and policies;<br />&bull; Enhanced security by enforcing separation of duties, providing mandatory approvals and preventing administrators from bypassing approval controls, eliminating silos of user administration, enabling Single Sign-On to the provisioning environment and providing reduced sign-on to web applications;</p>
<p>There are three (3) critical initiatives and related deliverables associated with this requirement that will be at risk if a sole source order is not issued to Deloitte for ICAM support:</p>
<p>1) Consolidation of provisioning tools through the development and implementation of ITIM workflows. This effort primarily involves the migration of seven (7) UPS provisioned applications (TWAI applications) into ITIM prior to September 30, 2013. The absence of required SME support pertaining to development of ITIM workflows and account management controls within targeted timelines will negatively impact targeted application business customers by delaying migration and automation of provisioning workflows, required user recertification and other planned security controls to be implemented through integration with ITIM. Moreover, such delays will produce additional risk pertaining to FMS' ability to implement FICAM and enforce NIST 800-53 Security Controls.</p>
<p>2) Further expansion of HSPD-12 initiatives through the extension of legacy FMS' PIV (Personal Identity Verification) Data Synchronization (PDS) solution to Legacy BPD (Bureau of the Public Debt). To streamline physical and logical access to resources, FMS successfully implemented a PIV Data Synchronization (PDS) process, integrating employee and contractor onboarding between HRConnect, USAccess and ITIM. Deloitte was instrumental in aiding FMS with the design, development, implementation and support of this solution. Deloitte's SME resources are currently assisting legacy BPD developer and IT resources in an effort to extend PDS functionalities for all Legacy BPD employee and contractor onboarding. If Deloitte services become unavailable during this ongoing project, the likelihood of project delays and immediate negative impact to bureau consolidation efforts is extremely high. For example, any further delay in extending PDS functionality throughout Fiscal Service will prevent full automation of employee and contractor onboarding, resulting in increasingly labor and resource intensive manual processes and rework once the solution is subsequently implemented.</p>
<p>3) Extension of ITIM provisioning to legacy BPD resources is an FMS and BPD strategic priority and a tactical initiative centered on aligning both agencies to Federal and Department of Treasury IT security mandates and guidance (e.g., TDP 85-01, NIST 800-53, FICAM and OMB M-11-11). This initiative dictates careful coordination with a variety of business stakeholders, Federal Program Agencies, application integrators and other stakeholders. Deloitte resources have a comprehensive working knowledge of ITIM and the Enterprise Architecture, due to the various levels of security and technical support it has provided in implementing ITIM and other segments of FMS' Identity and Access Management Program over the last eight years. A shift from Deloitte in providing this support will adversely impact requirements, development and ultimately application-specific integration with ITIM; the result of which will negatively impact application commitments and targeted account management controls. The outcome of such delay will require increased funding by the government to support interim operations and maintenance cost (at the application level) and will also require additional FTE time necessary to develop manual work-around processes within the EICAM division.</p>
<p>The success of this project depends on uninterrupted SME support through a critical period of security guidance and knowledge transfer that runs through September 30, 2013. The absence of Deloitte resources during this time would have a cascading impact on these three critical and time sensitive projects, as well as other initiatives. Based on a preliminary assessment of the IAM vendor market and given the historical knowledge that Deloitte maintains as a leader in the IAM and Security Spaces, an alternative vendor would not be able to transition onto this project and complete deliverables within the allowable time-frame. <br /><br />To transition to another vendor at this time is not feasible given Deloitte's historical knowledge, active knowledge transfer activities and comprehensive knowledge of industry practices in the area of ICAM. Continued support with Deloitte will provide for structured and documented knowledge transfer to Government Personnel for a six month period allowing time for a longer term contract to be competed and awarded.</p>
<p>It is the Governments intent is to issue a solicitation package in the next two months for a longer term vehicle for (ICAM) subject matter expertise to assist FMS' IBM Tivoli Identity Management (ITIM) developers and engineers with the (ITIM) full automation of user provisioning and security consulting services encompassing ICAM and related reporting.</p>
<p>For this six month award, no solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent to sole source is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received no later than 12:00 PM ET on March 11, 2013. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov; Attention: M. Forbes / G. Huffman.</p>
<p>Responses shall include, at a minimum, the following information:<br />1. The name of your company;<br />2. Company DUNS No.;<br />3. POC name and contact information;<br />4. The specific service(s) that your company offers that fulfills the same function as the services to be included on this order or evidence that your company is capable of providing a renewal for the specific services mentioned above; and,<br />5. A description of the service(s) and your company's overall capabilities.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to demonstrate how your services(s) are capable of providing the same services that exists with Identity Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) subject matter expertise to assist FMS' IBM Tivoli Identity Management (ITIM) developers and engineers with the (ITIM) full automation of user provisioning and security consulting services encompassing ICAM and related reporting mentioned above. The Government will not seek additional information from your company if you fail to provide sufficient evidence of having services cable of meeting the Government's needs.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government's Contracting Officer. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

The Library of Congress intends to issue a <strong>Sole Source</strong> purchase order to <strong>Univar inc. </strong>Any other firms desiring consideration must identify, in writing, its ability to meet the above mentioned delivery period. All expressions of interest must be received by email to rbeh@loc.gov no later than March 20, 2013 at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOW<br /><br /></span></strong>STATEMENT OF WORK - Contract to provide bulk chemicals for use in preserving film at the Library of Congress Packard Campus Film Preservation Laboratory.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br /><br />Provide bulk chemicals used in cleaning and developing films as part of the preservation of motion pictures within the film preservation lab located on the Library of Congress Packard Campus. This is an on-going requirement, with a base year plus 4 option years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Library faces many challenges with acquiring, managing, storing, preserving and making available audiovisual content. The Packard Campus (PCAVC) Film Preservation Laboratory is unique within the Federal sector providing a wide range of film preservation services including the cleaning of archival films as well as developing newly exposed "raw stock" created to copy the images found on archival film elements. The PCAVC requires its professional staff to utilize a wide range of expertise, knowledge, and vision regarding the technical equipment, precise preservation techniques, media, and its associated failure mechanisms. These experts are required to utilize state-of-the art cutting edge technologies to apply preservation techniques to fragile, obsolete, and legacy moving image materials. <br />Among the many challenges dealt with daily includes the need to preserve and provide access to moving image films in both 16 mm and 35 mm formats. The film preservation laboratory will prepare films for printing or scanning which involves the use of specialized equipment containing the chlorinated solvent perchloroethylene. Film printing equipment also contains perchloroethylene when operating in wet-printing modes. <br />Film developing machines also use a wide variety of chemicals combined using standard recipes developed by the Eastman Kodak company to develop the latent images exposed onto the film (raw stock) during the printing process. <br />The Packard Campus has a designated hazardous materials room with limited space for the storage of the chemicals used in cleaning, printing, and developing. As a result chemicals need to be ordered on a frequent basis and in limited quantities in order to meet the space restrictions.<br />Requirements of the Contract:</p>
<p>The Library wishes to purchase the following chemicals, delivered within the schedule indicated.

<DESC>The Department of Justice (DOJ), Criminal Division, intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order with Best Staffing Team Inc. for continuation of highly important Oracle Hyperion Financial Management system and accounting support services.
<p>DOJ Criminal Division's Financial Management Office has primary responsibility for the fulfillment of all financial management functions for the organization. The proposed purchase order will maintain continuity of financial support services.</p>
<p>Presently, the aforementioned services are being provided to Criminal Division through Best Staffing Team Inc. under a subcontractor arrangement. The primary contract expires on March 31, 2013 and cannot be extended. The services of Best&nbsp;Staffing Team Inc&nbsp;are required until a follow-on solution is in place. The period of performance for the purchase order will be approximately nine (9) months beginning around April 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.</p>
<p>Best Staffing Team Inc. has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain the financial support services required by the Criminal Division. Best Staffing Team Inc. is the only source that can seamlessly perform the required critical services using Criminal Division's Hyperion Financial Management System which is unique to the Criminal Division. Use of this system takes several week of intense training and the Best Staffing is expertly trained on the system. It would not be an effective use of time or resources to bring on new contractor support unfamiliar with the system. Additionally, it would take several months for a new contractor to clear Criminal Division's Security process. For this short term requirement, the duplication of costs to provide the necessary system training and the security clearance process could not be recovered by Criminal Division through competition or any other means. <br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this contract extension is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.<br />For the reasons noted above, Criminal Division intends to award a short-term purchase order to Best Staffing to ensure that the Criminal Division is able to meet its mission without any lapse in services while it completes the follow-on solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued, however, any firm that believes it can satisfy the requirements must give written notification to the Contracting Officer in the form of a capability statement. All supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail that demonstrates the ability to comply with the requirements and must be furnished to the point of contact listed below by Friday March 8, 2013 at 2:00 PM EST. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The information should be submitted to Lorenza Barnes, Lorenza.Barnes@usdoj.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>NAVSUP FLC Norfolk notice of a Pre-Solicitation Conference (Industry Day) for HAZMAT 3PL Support Services
<SOLNBR>N0018913HM3PL
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk will hold a Pre-Solicitation Conference (Industry Day) to solicit ideas and information on the most cost effective method to contract for HAZMAT 3PL services capable of meeting the Governments demand and delivery requirements.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to gather market research for FLC Norfolk to make decisions regarding the acquisition strategy for Mid-Atlantic HAZMAT 3PL services.  

Background Information:

Currently, FLC Norfolk does not have a separate pool of money to fund any labor costs associated with services provided.  Therefore, all costs need to be recovered through the sale of HAZMAT material under the resultant contract.
  FLC Norfolk is holding an industry day to solicit information and share ideas on how to reduce risk and procure HAZMAT material through a 3PL provider in a matter that is beneficial to both the Navy and industry.  It is not the intent of FLC Norfolk to limit the discussion to acquisition strategies without separate funding for labor; however, the Government does not anticipate separate funding will be provided.  For additional information on the requirement, a copy of the draft Performance Work Statement is included as Attachment I. 

Registration Details:

The one-day conference will be held in the Jack Room on 27 March 2013, at FLC Norfolk, Building W-143, 1968 Gilbert Street, Norfolk, Virginia 23511 from 9:00 AM to approximately 1:00 PM ET.
  

All registrations to attend the conference must be sent to chandra.brinkley@navy.mil by NLT 18 March 2013.  Registration emails should include the name of each attendee.  Each company is limited to three (3) attendees. Any attendees requiring a day pass to access Naval Station Norfolk must complete Attachment II and return it to chandra.brinkley@navy.mil NLT 3 PM ET on 18 March 2013.  

Attendees will have access to the conference room by 8:30 AM ET to allow time for arrival and registration.  

Disclaimer:

This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government.  The Navy will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.
  

Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Chandra Brinkley at 757-443-1442 or Chandra.Brinkley@navy.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE TO CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) CONTRACTORS<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 mandates across-the-board spending cuts (known as sequestration) be ordered on March 1, 2013.  As required by the law, the President issued a sequestration order canceling billions in budgetary resources across the Federal government for the remainder of the Federal fiscal year.  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the Agency is taking every step practicable to mitigate the effects of these cuts.  However, but based on the magnitude of these mandated cuts, there will be impacts on current contract awards as well as current and future planned acquisitions. For example, the Agency may decide not to exercise options or may need to negotiate lower prices or other terms via bilateral modifications to meet the constraints imposed by the sequestration. The Agency may also determine it necessary to stop or suspend work, reduce the scope of work, or partially or completely terminate existing contracts for the government's convenience.  Additionally, planned contract actions for new work may be rescoped, delayed, or canceled depending on the nature of the work and the degree to which it directly supports the Agency's critical mission needs and goals.  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agency is conducting a detailed analysis of current and pending contract actions that may be impacted. Existing contractors that will be impacted will be contacted directly by the cognizant Contracting Officer. The cognizant Contracting Officer for actions that are in process but not awarded will provide appropriate notifications to prospective and current offerors.   <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your continued partnership with the EPA, and for your cooperation as we work together to manage the impacts resulting from the sequestration.<br />

<DESC>Program Title:  Army Mobile Instrumented Training System (AMITS)<br><br>Introduction:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) intends to procure an integrated live Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) training capability with a focus on reduced operational, support, and sustainment costs and implementing a communications architecture that supports future TESS capabilities. <br><br>HITS is the Army program of record and AMITS will be the contract name providing the HITS capability.<br><br>Acquisition Strategy Planning Information (Draft):<br><br>Contract Vehicle:  TBD <br>Contract Type: TBD<br><br>Approximate Funding: $143M, FY13-FY18<br> 	Base award Base award ~ $7M FY13 (1st  Range 8-9 Months ARO)<br> 	FY14  ~ $29M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY15  ~ $30M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY16  ~ $30M (4 Ranges)<br> 	FY17  ~ $31M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY18  ~ $16M (2 Ranges)<br><br>Acquisition Time Estimates: <br> 	Sources Sought Release July 2012, followed up with Industry day<br> 	RFP Release September 2012 <br> 	Contract Award April 2013<br><br><br>Requirement: PM TRADE has a requirement to field a HITS training capability to 21 OCONUS and OCONUS sites over a 5 year period.  Most sites are CONUS but include Hawaii, Alaska, Germany, and Korea.  Additional FMS and support (customer funded) requirements may increase quantity buys.<br><br>Army Mobile Instrumented Training Systems (AMITS) will be fielded at rate of one per quarter beginning in 4Q13 and ending in 4Q18. The AMITS, with existing TESS and future OneTESS, will provide the end-to-end Home Station Training Capability in a mobile configuration. AMITS consists of a mobile instrumentation control center with AAR capability, mobile tower trailers, and a bi directional communications network between the vehicles and soldiers equipped with TESS, and has the capability for Over-The-Air remote configuration management updates to OneTESS/A-TESS type systems.  <br><br>A key objective of the AMITS program will be to reduce the operational support and sustainment costs of a HITS capability.  The integrated mobile shelter will host 4 operators, all network communications equipment, a powered telescoping antenna tower, rack servers, displays, permanent workstation desk/storage area, limited AAR capability, diesel generator, fuel, interior and exterior lighting, HVAC system for environmental extremes, and sound/thermal insulation.  The multi axle commercial shelter and mobile tower trailers will be capable of being towed by a HMMWV or F-250 type truck over semi-improved roads.  The 4 operators will be responsible for setting up, operating, maintaining, and taking down the entire AMITS.<br><br>Additionally, OneTESS indirect fire pairings will rely on AMITS communications to complete player Real Time casualty Assessment (RTCA) pairings and not the MILES laser.  This will require very low latency rates to support RTCA within the time of flight of the indirect fire munitions (mortars, artillery, MK-29, M203/320).   The communications architecture must be capable of supporting up to 2000 live entities (approximately 30% vehicles and 70% dismounts).  Intent is to acquire approximately 1165 player unit radios per fielding site. <br><br>Consolidated configuration management intent is to have it performed at a single location (likely Orlando) and pushed to each of the sites and OneTESS devices to reduce support and sustainment costs and improve configuration management.  <br><br>Follow-on Industry Meetings:  The government intends to release a draft set of technical documents and draft acquisition strategy information under a Sources Sought release in mid to late July.  Approximately 2 weeks later the government will host an Industry Day with one-on-one sessions.  <br><br>Business Collaboration Site on LT2 Portal: An AMITS business collaboration site has been established on the www.lt2portal.org site to help facilitate prime contractor and subcontractor product and capability exposure. New users must register and will be given access to the portal.  Navigate to the collaboration page and click the AMITS link to access the role/product/POC spread sheet.<br><br>RFI: As a part of Market Research, the project team requests interested Prime contractors provide a 1-5 page product summary of existing fielded capabilities currently in use in a military/government operational/training environment supporting the same or similar requirements.  Responses must include evidence of being capable of meeting an 8 month after contract award delivery schedule with no development funding provided.  Please clearly indicate if you are a large or small business.  If a small business, identify other appropriate information for set-aside purposes (8(a), woman-owned, etc).  Additionally, if you are a STOC II contractor in PEO STRI's STOC II IDIQ contracts, please indicate that.<br><br>Prime contractors are encouraged to schedule an initial face to face meeting with Mr. Rob Wolf between 19 June and 3 July to facilitate government market research and provide their RFI response via email to rob.wolf1@us.army.mil.  Written responses should be submitted at least one fill business day prior to the scheduled face-to face. If you are not scheduling an initial meeting please provide your response NLT 28 June.<br><br>POCs:  Technical: Mr. Rob Wolf, 407 384 5233 rob.wolf1@us.army.mil,  Contracts:  Mr. Terry Gotter, 407 380 4338 terry.gotter@us.army.mil <br>

<DESC>This is an award is being issued as a sole source to R & M Government Services, Inc., a small business, who will provide parts and service for automation line and equipment needed to connect existing contracted laboratory equipment at the VA Medical Center in Philadelphia.  The automation equipment is being purchased to help the lab fulfill its customer needs to report laboratory testing in a timely manner. The current configuration is manual transport of the specimen from one section of the laboratory to another for additional testing. The automation is a robotic system of transportation of the laboratory specimens from pre-analytics (specimen receipt and centrifugation), analytics (specimen testing) and finally post-analytics (storage). Only Beckman Coulter automation is currently configurable with the current equipment.  This is part of a standardization being conducted in the VISN 4 laboratories.  We currently have 2 Beckman Coulter DXI Immunoassay analyzers and 3 DXC general chemistry analyzers which are maintained under contract VA244-BP-0077 for the next 4 years. The parts provided would have to connect with the Beckman Coulter contracted equipment. The Beckman Coulter equipment now in the Medical Center is the Chemistry and Immunoassay Instrumentation version DXC 800 Chemistry and Integrated, Remisol, and DXL 800 Immunoassay.  There also is the Hematology Instrumentation version LH 785, LH 780 and LH 750.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />Investigations of Health IT-related Deaths, Serious Injuries, or Unsafe Conditions
<p><br />Pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management, intends to negotiate a sole source, firm fixed-price contract with The Joint Commission (TJC), located at One Renaissance Blvd., Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181, on behalf of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC). The period of performance for the award will be for a 12 month base period, plus one 12 month option period, beginning from the effective date of the contract.</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to improve patient safety related to health IT, ONC sponsored the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in making recommendations on health IT safety, which were published in November 2011 in Health IT and Patient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care. Among other recommendations, the IOM identified the need for an independent Federal entity to investigate patient safety deaths, serious injuries, or potentially unsafe conditions associated with health IT. This acquisition shall address the IOM recommendation. It solicits a proposal from an existing private sector organization that has substantial experience in oversight of patient safety, with a large database of reported serious adverse events, and with the capacity to investigate such events (while protecting patient privacy and legal privileges), in order to ensure that health IT-related events are investigated and to gather information that will enable ONC to evaluate the best way to more fully address the IOM recommendation.</p>
<p>The acquisition requires research on a database of sentinel events in healthcare involving at least 2,500 events over the past 3 years. Smaller numbers of such events would not allow identification of enough health IT-related sentinel events (which will likely be less than 1% of all sentinel events) to be able to classify and describe health IT-related events. The acquisition further requires investigations of at least 10 health IT-related sentinel events in the base period, which must be completed during the first 11 months of this contract. An additional 10 investigations must be completed in the option period. To identify 10 health IT-related reports in 11 months will require over 1200 reports annually, assuming (based on best evidence available) that less than 1 percent will be related to health IT.</p>
<p><br />Only one award will be made. A firm fixed-price contract will be awarded. The period of performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award, with one 12-month option period.</p>
<p>The purposes for this acquisition are (1) to promote and ensure effective investigations of health IT-related deaths, serious injuries, and potentially unsafe conditions in the private sector; (2) to provide public safety information based on such investigations; (3) to improve ONC'S understanding of investigations by better understanding health IT-related deaths, serious injuries, and potentially unsafe conditions through research on a database that includes such events, including on the types, frequency, and severity of health IT-related events; and (4) to receive a final report summarizing what has been learned and make recommendations on how to ensure effective investigations of health IT-related events to promote patient safety.<br />The objectives for this acquisition are to (1) identify a private sector healthcare safety organization to conduct at least 10 health IT-related sentinel event investigations as part of an effective program for identifying and responding to sentinel events; (2) strengthen the ability of healthcare providers to identify when a sentinel event is health IT-related and to conduct investigations of health IT-related sentinel event; (3) based on investigations and other evidence, make information publicly available on identifying and avoiding health IT-related sentinel events and promoting health IT patient safety; (4) better understand and classify health IT-related sentinel events in the context of all causes of sentinel events, support research on a sentinel events database that includes at least 2500 sentinel events over the past three years; and (5) evaluate and describe effective investigations of health IT-related sentinel events, ways to address or prevent health IT-related sentinel events, and the role of external organizations in investigations of health IT-related sentinel events. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same services. All capability statements received by closing of this notification will be considered by the Government. Each response should include the following business information:</p>
<p>a. DUNS.<br />b. Company Name.<br />c. Company Address.<br />d. Current GSA Schedules (if appropriate).<br />e. Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, veteran owned, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). <br />f. Company Point of Contact, Phone and Email address</p>
<p>All responses are due to the Contract Specialist by 3:00 p.m., EST, March 15, 2013. Email statements are preferred.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.</p>

<a href="mailto:cleonard@usgs.gov">cleonard@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>GSN VERY BROADBAND BOREHOLE SEISMOMETER REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY This is a request for information (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is not a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The purpose of this request for information is in support of market research being conducted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet a prospective need for very broadband borehole seismometers and to gather information on current products, technologies, and capabilities within the market.  This synopsis is for acquisition planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. 
All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience/capabilities in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, joint ventures etc.) Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research. 
In accordance with FAR 19.5, Set-Asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, if a solicitation follows. Offerors are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  Any follow-on procurement strategy will be based on the results of the information provided from Offerors and available funding.
In accordance with FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: FAR 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "Offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of soliciting industry's best ideas for a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or modified very broadband borehole seismometer. Interested companies should respond with information on their current commercial product(s) and how they might address the capability for adapting them to meet the USGS requirements.
As a result of this RFI, the USGS is requesting a technical capabilities statement that will address the items outlined in the RFI from potential Offerors. If a potential Offeror is unable to provide a total solution, the Offeror is encouraged to submit information and propose the resources (including factors like time and financial assistance) needed to develop or compliment their proposed solution. Elaborate proposals or very detailed pricing information are not required. Any innovative and new conceptual ideas to achieve the USGS objectives are encouraged.
Proposed Requirement Overview/Objectives The USGS has a requirement for broadband borehole seismometers for the Global Seismographic Network. The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is a permanent, digital network of more than 150 modern stations in over 80 countries, from the South Pole to Siberia and from the Pacific basin to the southern tip of Africa.  The GSN was formed in 1986 as a partnership among the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS, a university consortium) and serves as a multi-use scientific facility and societal resource for monitoring, research, and education.  See Attachments 1 and 2 for the anticipated specifications for this requirement. The USGS requires three-component very broadband borehole seismometers that meet these specifications.  The specifications given in Attachment 1 assume that the sensor is a traditional force feedback system with three analog outputs which are digitized outside of the seismometer. The USGS is also willing to consider digital solutions if the resulting sensor/system has comparable (or improved) bandwidth, dynamic range, noise performance, and physical characteristics; the specifications for digital solutions are in Attachment 2.  The USGS has a moderate preference for analog sensors because of the existing data acquisition systems at the stations.
Interested companies should respond no later than 1 April 2013 with information on their current commercial product(s) and how they might address the development of very broadband borehole seismometers that would meet the proposed specifications. Responses should include information regarding company background/experience, personnel, and facilities. Product information provided should include cost estimates, detailed technical information (i.e., technical literature, independent or pending laboratory test data, capacity data, as well as illustrations, photographs, any relevant patents. Firms responding should indicate whether or not they are small, and women-, veteran-, and/or minority-owned businesses. A point of contact, telephone and fax numbers, web address, and e-mail address should be provided. Any information/samples submitted will not be returned (unless return arrangements are agreed upon beforehand). This Request for Information (RFI) of potential sources is a required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties in order to minimize cost both to potentially interested parties and the Government. A determination of the contract type, mechanism for procuring the product and possible set-aside status will not be made by the Government until the conclusion of market research. No formal proposals are being requested under this synopsis. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334513 and the size standard is 500 employees.
Responses to this notice are to be sent electronically via e-mail to Christine Leonard, cleonard@usgs.gov.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort <br /><br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only. This s ubfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems (PEO GCS) maintains one of the largest Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Project Server, and .NET Web Application hosting environments in the Army.  This environment extensively uses VMware Server Virtualization software (http://www.vmware.com/). This environment has been having issues with VMware Virtual servers over the past few months.  Virtual Network Interface Cards (NICs) stop working or disappear.  Servers when rebooted do not 'see' the rest of the Farm.  Servers when rebooted stay in an indeterminate limbo state.    This is a Mission Critical Environment.  PEO GCS's SharePoint environment is not stable with the feeling that the VMware environment is not properly configured, unstable, and the root cause of most SharePoint issues.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The RSTB Task Force Training (TFT) exercise is the capstone pre-deployment training event for the 75th Ranger Special Troops Battalion (RSTB), and prepares Rangers of the Regimental Reconnaissance, Military Intelligence, and Communications Companies as well as the Technical Surveillance Detachment to execute their deployed missions.  The exercise has a secondary purpose of training RSTB staff sections in command and control and support functions and of providing realistic training opportunities for a team from the 95th Civil Affairs Battalion.  TFT 2-13 will be conducted in Jacksonville, FL and Valdosta, GA from 8-23 April 2013.   <br>  <br> The exercise is facilitated by a script which establishes the overall scenario and includes the development of fictional target personalities with credible back stories, organized into an enemy cell with a plan to conduct a simulated insurgent attack in the exercise city.  Contracted role players are used to simulate the targeted individuals, sources, host nation security forces, and interpreters.  The contractor also provides backside coordination and support to synchronize the role players and to incorporate necessary changes and injects to the script to facilitate the training objectives of the battalion, as well as SMEs on Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and all-source intelligence to coach and mentor RSTB collectors and analysts.  <br>

<p>The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded based on the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>(1) Technical: Offers must meet or exceed the specifications in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. <br /><br />Technical Requirements are the primary determining factors of an offeror's ability to perform. Offerors shall describe how they meet or plan to meet all mandatory requirements in the respective Statement of Work (SOW) and contract clauses. The Government will review proposals to determine whether or not an offeror has adequately demonstrated an ability to meet or exceed the Government's requirements on Section 3 of the SOW. For each technical requirement, offers demonstrating an ability to perform will at a minimum be determined "acceptable" for that requirement task. Depending on each contractor's capability, they may be determined to be outside the realm of acceptability and not provided an opportunity to revise their quote if discussions become necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Price: For offers which meet all other evaluation factors, award will be made to the low offeror based on price. Price Evaluation is to be performed by the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer. Vendors are required to submit price quotes in accordance with the proposed CLINs structure. Vendors are to provide firm-fixed pricing for each of the CLIN's as well as a total price for the entire effort. The Government will evaluate offers for award purpose by adding the total price for all options to the total price basic requirement.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors via e-mail with instructions of this decision. The Contracting Officer will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process.</p>
<p><br />(3)Period of Performance: Offerors must meet the required delivery date, or if POP: Offerors must be able to start performance on the required period of performance.</p>
<p><br />Each offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness. The Government currently intends to award a contract with a period of performance of 12 months and a twelve months option period.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to award without negotiating, under a lowest price, technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation approach.</p>

<p>The Government has the option to to extend the services for this action. Therefore, FAR 52.217-8, , "Option to Extend Services Addendum"applies to this acquisition. <br />"The government might find it necessary to exercise FAR clause 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services" at some point in this contract.

Should the "Option to Extend Services" clause be exercised, pricing will follow past practices and be set at the then current rates being utilized in the contract, prorated to the Extended Services performance periods being utilized. For example, should this clause be exercised for a two month performance period to follow the option year one performance period of the contract, then the pricing would be set for two months at option year one pricing, barring the operation of other law."</p>
<p>This procurement has delivery order limitation of minimum and maximum. Therefore, 52.216-19, "Order Limitations" applies to this acquisition by full text.</p>
<p>As prescribed in 16.506(b), insert a clause substantially the same as follows:</p>
<p>Order Limitations (Oct 1995)</p>
<p>(a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than:</p>
<p>CLIN QUANTITY</p>
<p>0002 400 Assessments<br />0003 15 Health Promotion Activities (to include 2 <br />Nutrition Events presented in Center Restaurant)<br />0004 15 Seminars<br />0005 15 Screenings<br />0006 40 Assessments- DLA Aviation- Mechanicsburg<br />0007 6 Screenings- DLA Aviation- Mechanicsburg</p>

<p>(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 10 days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />This procurement is a candidate for Reverse Auction. Therefore, DLAD 52.215-9023, "Reverse Auction" applies to this acquisition by full text.</p>
<p>As prescribed in DLAD 15.408-90(c)(1), use the following provision.</p>
<p>REVERSE AUCTION (NOV 2012)</p>
<p><br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.</p>
<p>(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.</p>
<p>(d) The lowest offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(e) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted, the "Not Lead" offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; it will be ineligible for award if the final price in the auction is the tie offer price.</p>
<p>(f) An offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction.</p>
<p>(g) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6 as applicable and in conjunction with FAR part 13.5, and supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is <br />13-223-SOL-0044. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 dated February 28, 2013.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is set-aside 100% for small business concerns.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Arkansas Regional Laboratory (ARL) requires an Automated Cleanup System and Concentration Units with post-warranty service/maintenance to facilitate the automated clean-up and concentration of Dioxin, Furan, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB), and Polybrominated Diphenylethers (PBDE) analyses in sample extracts from matrices including eggs, fish, feeds, dairy products and soil.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The ARL is the servicing lab for the FDA's Dioxin Program which focuses on the ultra-trace analysis of dioxins, furans, PCBs, and PBDEs. The sample extraction and cleanup for these analytes is very labor intensive and is susceptible to contamination during sample handling. ARL currently uses equipment from Fluid Management Systems for the liquid pressurized extraction and clean-up of various matrices. This request is for the purchase and installation of an additional cleanup system and concentration units to increase the sample handling capacity which will enhance productivity and minimize potential contamination by automating sample transfer and concentration steps for the clean-up. Specific requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>Minimum Performance Requirements:</p>
<p>Automated Clean-up System</p>
<p>&bull;The system shall have the ability to simultaneously clean up (unattended after loading samples) up to six samples followed by a direct automated delivery of the cleaned sample extract to a concentration unit.</p>

<p>&bull;Clean-up solvents shall include methylene chloride, hexane, toluene, and ethyl acetate.</p>
<p>&bull;Each of the six samples shall be simultaneously cleaned via independently controlled module.</p>
<p>&bull;The automated clean-up procedure shall use various clean-up columns including AX-21 carbon, acidified silica gel, and activated alumina, with automated delivery to a concentration unit.</p>
<p>&bull;The clean-up process shall include the ability to automatically change the directional flow in order to load and elute the AX-21 carbon column using different solvents.</p>
<p>&bull;The clean-up process shall include the ability to collect multiple elution fractions off the columns, unattended.</p>
<p>&bull;Concentration shall be completed with a solvent evaporation step directly into a GC vial insert while unattended.</p>
<p>&bull;Concentration equipment shall consist of a waterless system.</p>
<p>&bull;Clean-up columns (alumina, acidified silica, basic silica, and AX-21 carbon) shall be certified to be phthalate, PCB, PBDE, and dioxin free.</p>
<p>&bull;System shall provide an automated clean-up procedure using various clean-up columns including carbon and completing with a solvent evaporation step directly into a Gas Chromatograph vial insert ready for analyses on a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS).</p>
<p>&bull; The equipment shall be new, not used, refurbished, or previously used for demonstration.</p>
<p>&bull;The equipment shall be compatible with an existing Power Prep Clean-up System manufactured by Fluid Management Systems, serial number 5134423TAG with DMS-6000 software.</p>
<p>&bull;The contractor shall provide inside delivery, set-up, installation, and on-site training.</p>
<p>&bull;All equipment shall include a minimum 12- month warranty</p>
<p>&bull;System shall be capable of producing 2 batches of 6 samples within a 24-hour period</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is EA-133F-13-RQ-0239 . The U.S. Dept of Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Silver Spring, Maryland has a requirement for lease of 10 Rental Houses in Grand Isle, Louisiana as follows.
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK for RENTAL HOUSES IN GRAND ISLE, LA<br />Background</p>
<p>As part of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) Natural Resource Damage Assessment effort, NOAA will send a team of approximately 60 field researchers to Grand Isle, LA during the period June 14-30, 2013 to conduct a dolphin health assessment. The field staff will primarily be NOAA employees, contracted through NOAA, or on NOAA invitational travel. Housing will be needed for these researchers June 14 - June 30. On any given day, there will be approximately 60 researchers staying in the houses, although it will not necessarily be the same researchers for the entire time (some researchers may only participate for the 1st or 2nd week, but not both). Rental houses are the only option for lodging in the area. The closest chain hotel is 30 miles (45 minute drive) from the field site. Field operations will be based at the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) laboratory on Grand Isle and field staff must be housed in close proximity to this facility (preferably within 10 miles). Field staff will need to be at the LDWF dock by 7:00 a.m. every morning to commence field operations and many will need to remain at the lab late into the evenings to process samples. Having staff stay in relatively close proximity to the LDWF base site will facilitate travel to/from the lab, reduce fuel costs, and minimize the number of rental cars needed.</p>
<p>Location: Grand Isle, LA</p>
<p>Period of Performance: June 14, 2013 through June 30, 2013.</p>
<p>Number of units required: We will need housing for 60 researchers from June 14 - June 30. The 60 people can be divided up in a number of ways in varying size units, but to facilitate logistics and minimize transportation cost (i.e., the number of rental cars), we would like to have 10 single family houses. There will be approximately 30 female and 30 male researchers, although the number of female/male personnel will vary day-to-day.<br /><br />The specific requirements for each house are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Each house must be a single family house, fully furnished with complete kitchen.<br />2. Each house must have at least 2 full bathrooms.<br />3. Each house must have at least 3 bedrooms.<br />4. Each house must have at least 5 beds; the beds may be distributed in different ways among the 3 or more bedrooms, but must be actually beds, not fold-out sofas.<br />5. Linens must be furnished for each bed; at least 5 sets of towels (include wash rag, bath towel) and at least 4 hand towels must be furnished per house.<br />6. Houses must be air-conditioned.<br />7. Houses must be clean and secure - e.g., there should be no bed bug or other insect issues and doors and windows must lock; must have smoke detector.<br />8. Must have at least one television (20" or larger) provided in a central location and have cable, satellite dish, or antenna to receive at least local TV stations.<br />9. Must have microwave oven (compact size or larger), stove, and standard oven.<br />10. Must have washer/dryer. Washer and dryer may be compact size (capable of handling 4 lbs of laundry), conventional full-size or large capacity models.<br />11. Must have parking for at least 2 full-size pick-up (1000 lb capacity) trucks per house; parking may be in either a driveway or garage.<br />12. Must have table and chairs, set of dishes to accommodate 4-6 people, silverware, pots and pans, kitchen accessories, etc. <br />13. Must have at least one coffee maker and cleaning equipment (1 broom and/or 1 vacuum) for each house.<br />14. Internet access must be provided in at least 2 of the units.</p>
<p>"The C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required"</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED FOR<br />UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC RELEASE <br />NRMA0006-13-00187</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER), located administratively within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, is responsible for coordinating interdisciplinary ocean exploration expeditions and projects to search, investigate, and document unknown and poorly known areas of the ocean in order to advance and disseminate knowledge of the ocean environment and its physical, chemical, biological, and historical resources. The office is based at NOAA Headquarters in Silver Spring, MD.</p>
<p>NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer is a research vessel dedicated to exploring unknown areas of the deep-ocean. The vessel is equipped with full ocean depth multibeam sonar mapping system and a two-bodied, deep-water Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) system capable of diving to 6,000m. <br />Purpose: A major component supporting the ROV systems on the Okeanos Explorer is an existing USBL Acoustic Navigation System, which consists of an acoustic transceiver on the ship that measures range, bearing and azimuth to an acoustic transponder on the ROV, providing an estimate of the position of the ROV relative to the ship. <br />In order to be able to test and calibrate the Acoustic Navigation System a transponder will be dropped to the seafloor, providing a fixed reference point for calibration of the Acoustic Navigation System. <br />The package that supports the calibration includes an acoustic transponder, glass balls that provide flotation, and a steel weight that anchors the package on the seafloor. In order to recover the package, the anchor weight must be released and left behind allowing the glass balls to float the package to the surface for recovery.<br />This acquisition is for an Underwater Acoustic Release to support the function of dropping the anchor weight. The Release will be a compact metallic cylinder physically coupling the buoyant main package to a wire or chain attached to the anchor weight until the Release is acoustically commanded to release the weight. At that point the Release will drop the anchor, allowing the package (including the Release) to float to the surface.<br />An Electronic Control Box capable of commanding the Release is also required.<br />While the Acoustic Navigation System and the Underwater Acoustic Release are not required to function simultaneously, the Vendor of the Underwater Acoustic Release must be able to confirm that the acoustic communications used by the navigation system (LinkQuest Tracklink 10000) will not cause the Underwater Acoustic Release to activate.<br />OER has determined that appropriate components are available as COTS, with typical delivery times of approximately four weeks.<br />Management: Program Manager for this project will be: John McDonough/Craig Russell. Technical Manager for the project will be: David Lovalvo<br />Scope of Work: NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) wishes to solicit proposals for an "Underwater Acoustic Release". The solicitation requires provision of the Release itself, and of an "Electronic Control Box" used on shipboard to acoustically command the Release. The details of this request are outlined below:</p>
<p>The Underwater Acoustic Release shall meet the following specifications:<br />&bull; Minimum depth rating: 3000 meters (9842 feet) sea water<br />&bull; Maximum weight in seawater: 13 lbs<br />&bull; Minimum release weight capacity: 400 lbs <br />&bull; Acoustic range: 4000 meters minimum, assuming no abnormal acoustic conditions<br />&bull; Battery life: 1 year of operation, 2 years shelf life</p>
<p>Component Working Environment and Materials<br />&bull; In service, the Underwater Acoustic Release must operate in open ocean environments, and must be constructed of appropriate materials for a long service life in terms of corrosion, ruggedness and reliability.</p>
<p>The Electronic Control Box shall fulfill the following characteristics:<br />&bull; Shall be packaged appropriately for use on a ship's deck without the need for additional protection from moderate rain or salt spray. <br />&bull; Shall be readily portable, battery powered and rechargeable. <br />&bull; Shall include an appropriate hydrophone and cable that can be deployed over the side of the ship to support acoustic communication with the Release. The cable shall have a length of at least 20 meters (66 feet). <br />&bull; Power supply connections for recharging shall be standard North American receptacle 120 VAC 60 Hz power.<br /><br />Prerequisites <br />&bull; Affordable cost for services as determined by OER's available budget.<br />&bull; Proof of successful past performance building the same or similar products will be required before bid acceptance.<br />&bull; Acceptable delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Expendables<br />If operation of the Release requires any expendable components that must be replaced for each use, sufficient quantity of those components shall be provided for in the bid to support twenty-five (25) deployments.</p>
<p>Component Description and Deliverable Quantities - Fabricated Parts<br /><br />Qty Description<br />1 Underwater Acoustic Release <br />1 Command Electronics with hydrophone<br />25 Expendables</p>
<p><br />Documentation<br />The Underwater Acoustic Release and Command Electronics shall be delivered with documentation that includes outline drawings, operation and maintenance manuals to commercial standards. Documentation shall be both hardcopy and machine-readable media.</p>

  When/if, in the opinion of the contractor, an effort outside the existing scope of the contract (or delivery/task order) is requested, the contractor shall promptly notify the PCO in writing.  No action shall be taken by the contractor under such direction unless the PCO or ACO has issued a contractual change or otherwise resolved the issue.
*To be determined at contract award

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.<br /><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for architectural and engineering services and anticipates awarding one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts as a result of this synopsis. It is anticipated that the maximum quantity required for the contract will be $500,000. The minimum value the Government will be required to order will be $25,000 and no single order will have a fee in excess of $300,000. <br /><br />This procurement is being issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541310 and the small business size standard is $7 million. <br /><br />PROJECT INFORMATION: The contractor will be required to provide facility condition assessment as it relates to maintenance and repair of all components of the facilities. The types of building at the Naval Research Laboratory are general laboratory space, office buildings, industrial warehouses, and other support facilities. The first order to be place under the prospective contract will evaluate the conditions (as it relates to maintenance and repair) of approximately 1,000,000 square feet of space at NRL. The firm will identify and locate all components (requiring maintenance or repair) of the facilities, determine the remaining life of the component, make recommendations on current and future maintenance projects with cost estimates, and recommendations on changes in maintenance practices. <br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: The NRL may determine which effort will be assigned to the awardee based on experience and qualifications. Firms responding to this announcement must do so in accordance with&nbsp;the evaluation criteria listed at FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1, which are being presented below in descending order of importance: <br /><br />(1) The contractor shall provide specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Architectural, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Environmental and Energy Management disciplines. This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. The A&amp;E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required. <br /><br />(2) The contractor shall provide professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project. Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members. If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment. <br /><br />(3) Each contractor must also provide convincing evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (usually twenty weeks for the each delivery order plus Government review time). It is very important to demonstrate the firm's ability juggle workload and to manage a number of projects at one time, such as would be required in an IDIQ type contract environment. <br /><br />(4) The contractor must provide past performance information on contracts with Government agencies and private industry, which demonstrates cost control, quality of work, and compliance with the performance schedules. Demonstrating this should include, at a minimum, things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, preferably IDIQ type contracts with multiple orders, the points of contact and phone numbers for references. <br /><br />(5) Contractors will also be evaluated on their location, which typically should be in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project. Contractors must be sure to include the location of each of the proposed subcontractors. <br /><br />(6) Contractors must provide the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (for the last twelve months). <br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement, and wish to be considered, must respond no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on the response date specified herein. It is anticipated that the IDIQ type contract be awarded as a result of this synopsis will have a period of performance of 24-months from the date the contract is awarded. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541310. All questions should be directed to the point of contact below. <br /><br />All interested parties must send one copy of their SF-252 and SF-254, using the mailing address set forth herein, to Contracting Officer, ATTN: Code 3230.<br /><br />Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">General Services Administration&rsquo;s (GSA) Greater Southwest Region has a need for electric power to operate its federal government owned and occupied buildings located within deregulated areas of the Texas ERCOT marketplace. Buildings are located in the Oncor, AEP, AEP North and Centerpoint (lines and wires) transmission and delivery service delivery areas.&nbsp; GSA is seeking cost effective proposals providing mostly <strong>renewable energy</strong> to be delivered to GSA facilities.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The successful offeror will supply electricity, scheduling, transmission, billing, and other related and ancillary services for either 60 or 120 monthly billing cycles generally beginning with the next available meter read after contract award, the current contract expires July 31, 2013.&nbsp; The approximate one year electric requirement is 124,000,000 kWh.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The government is seeking a fixed price flat rate contract for an optimal term of ten years.&nbsp; The Government will also request pricing for a five year term.&nbsp; Given the volatility of fuel costs and electricity prices, and the difficulty of determining where natural gas and other generation fuel markets are headed in the future, GSA requires stable supply and pricing. GSA has decided to address these issues by procurement of reliable, price stable and economically feasible electric energy, with consideration being given to clean renewable energy to supply its facilities. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The Government is looking for pricing on 100% of its requirements and this will be a requirements contract when awarded. The Government&rsquo;s preference is to award 100% of the power to be supplied by renewable energy. However, bids will also be accepted for 50% renewable and 100% conventionally generated electric power and award will be made to either of these if the 100% renewable price is not considered fair and reasonable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The procurement will be held in a two-step bid process with the technical proposals due April 8, 2013. <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span>Technical proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation factors noted in the solicitation.&nbsp; Discussions may, or may not,<span style="color: red;"> </span>be held.&nbsp; The Government intends to award a contract(s) to the offeror(s) that offers the best value for each pricing group and meets the solicitation's minimum technical requirements.&nbsp; Multiple Awards may be made.&nbsp; A supplier&rsquo;s technical response will be due no later than 3:00 p.m. CT on April 8, 2013 at the address specified in the solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors determined to be in the competitive range, will submit final pricing via GSA's Reverse Auction Website, and will be notified separately once they have been selected to participate in the reverse auction.</span></p>

Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide services outlined above.  A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />DATED: FEBRUARY 28, 2013</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The USCG Training Center Yorktown, VA (TRACEN Yorktown) requires chargers for several batteries that are in use in the Fast Response Cutter (FRC) Lab for the MTU 20V4000 series engine. <br />1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services. Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The USCG has made a conscious effort within the last few years to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solutions to workforce performance problems, while simultaneously optimizing the current training infrastructure to meet operational and logistical demands. The USCG currently relies heavily on contracted training for the maintenance, operation, and troubleshooting of MTU propulsion machinery and electronic controls on the WPC class cutter. The USCG training program management office (FC-Tms) has worked to garner the resources necessary to lessen the reliance on contracted training. The USCG has determined that TRACEN Yorktown's Engineering and Weapons (T-ew) facility will be the future site to train operators and maintainers of this equipment. A significant T-ew facilities renovation is currently underway and will include the construction of a new building intended to house the WPC/FRC training aids, laboratories, and classrooms to create the USCG Training Center Yorktown, Engineering Systems School. The batteries shall be stored at the USCG Training Center Yorktown, Engineering Systems School Battery lab.</p>
<p>1.3 SECURITY.<br />Contractor access to classified information is not currently required under this task order.</p>
<p>1.4 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.<br />The period of performance for this Purchase Order will be 12 months ARO.</p>
<p>1.5 DELIVERY <br />The primary place of performance shall be at USCG TRACEN Yorktown, VA for the delivery of the batteries.</p>
<p>1.6 PROJECT PLAN. <br />The Contractor shall provide a draft Project Plan for Government review and comment with (3) business days ARO. The Project Plan shall include tentative dates for delivery during the Period of Performance to include any equipment options executed by the Government.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>(e) Contractor personnel requiring a user account for access to systems operated by the contractor for DOC or interconnected to a DOC network to perform contract services shall be screened at an appropriate level in accordance with Commerce Acquisition Manual 1337.70, Security Processing Requirements for Service Contracts.

The COR will inform the contractor of any other available DOC training resources. Annually thereafter the contractor shall certify in writing to the COR that its employees, in performance of the contract, have completed annual refresher training as required by section 15.4 of the DOC IT Security Program Policy. (g) Within 5 days of contract award, the contractor shall provide the COR with signed acknowledgement of the provisions as contained in Commerce Acquisition Regulation (CAR), 1352.209?72, Restrictions Against Disclosures. (h) The contractor shall afford DOC, including the Office of Inspector General, access to the contractor's and subcontractor's facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases, and personnel used in performance of the contract. Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection, investigation, and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of DOC data or to the function of computer systems operated on behalf of DOC, and to preserve evidence of computer crime. (i) For all contractor-owned systems for which performance of the contract requires interconnection with a DOC network on which DOC data will be stored or processed, the contractor shall provide, implement, and maintain a System Accreditation Package in accordance with the DOC IT Security Program Policy.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFP 226264 <br />One C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />February 12, 2013 (reposted from Nov 2012)</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered CSAPRs and the new CSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the transportable CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed at PNNL in Richland, WA.</p>

<CONTACT>Katie McMahon, Phone 3144896787, Email katie.mcmahon@ramstein.af.mil
<DESC><p>A few contractors have emailed me with questions pertaining to the Runway Rubber Removal Trucks. Below I have listed the questions and answers.<br /><br />Question 1~ Truck specs state "Shall have the ability to remove paint marking from pavement at a minimum average rate of 1,600 square meters per hour." Contractor is asking if it should be meters per hour instead of square<br />meters per hour.<br /><br />Answer 1- Should be square meters per hour as this is the industry standard. If we only stated meters per hour the width would come into question.</p>
<p><br />Question 2~ Can you specify how many axles the Chassis should have.<br /><br />Answer 2- 3 axles minimum but a heavier design may require more.</p>
<p><br />Question 3~ The contractor was also asking for additional information pertaining to the Chassis (how many tons, is there a specific manufacturer etc.).<br /><br />Answer 3- We cannot specify the manufacturer but the vehicle must be legal to operate in Germany/Europe. The chassis specifications would depend on the specific design of the rubber removal system.</p>
<p><br />Question 4~ "Shall contain water and debris storage to allow continuous rubber or paint removal operations for at least 2 hours without refilling water or dumping debris." Please specify how many volumes of water this should be able to hold.</p>
<p>Answer 4- We cannot determine the capacity of the tank because the size of the tank<br />would depend on the specific design of the rubber removal system.</p>

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

The ENVG III is a follow-on contract strategy to previous ENVG procurements (ENVG I, ENVG II).  The distinction of ENVG III from previous ENVGs procured to date is the added Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) technology when used with the FWS-I.  The FWS-I will be a weapon mounted long wave infrared sensor used for surveillance and fire control of individual weapons during daylight, darkness, adverse weather and dirty battlefield conditions.  When combined with the ENVG III, the FWS-I provides RTA which will wirelessly send weapon imagery (with reticle) spatially aligned with the ENVG III image.  The RTA capability will reduce by up to 50 percent the Soldier's time from target detection to effective engagement of the threat target with their host weapon.  This will improve Soldier lethality, enhance Soldier effectiveness and improve Soldier survivability by reducing Soldier exposure to threat weapons.  All systems, components and spares being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.   <br>      <br>  This requirement is for the continued production phase of the ENVG system (ENVG III) and the FWS-I Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phases. The anticipated period of performance is a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.   <br>  The Government anticipates full & open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 333314 - Night vision optical device manufacturing.   <br>  The release of the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) is tentatively planned for mid March 2013, with all the solicitation and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following web address: https://www.fbo.gov/.  Instructions to receive limited distribution documents, to include all product descriptions and specifications will be provided with the draft solicitation and resultant final solicitation. No hard copies of this RFP will be issued. All respondents shall be responsible for obtaining documentation from this location.   <br>      <br>  Point of Contact (POC) - Andrew Mitchell   <br>  E-mail: andrew.c.mitchell1.civ@mail.mil   <br>

Jennifer can be reached via email at jennifer.t.beck@us.army.mil or phone at 256.876.5515.********  <br>    <br>  1.  This is a special notice to industry inviting attendance to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Forum (UAS-TF).  The Government seeks involvement of industry in capturing potential improvement technology for unmanned aircraft systems, either ground sub-systems or air vehicles, including payloads.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this invitation nor to pay for participation.  <br>    <br>  2.  The US Army Unmanned Aircraft System Project Office (UAS PO) is inviting AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium industry attendees and other interested industry participants to schedule one-on-one UAS-TF appointments to make brief presentations about technologies related to future payloads, sense and avoid, ground systems and air vehicles.  The industry technology presented is required to be at least a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 5.  Verbal commitment must be in place that the TRL / MRL 5 exist before scheduling can take place.  <br>    <br>  3.  The intent of the government is to identify technology improvements or new technologies that are at TRL / MRL 5.  This technology improvement may be implemented, in whole or in part, in UAS individual projects according to specific requirements and objectives, but the UAS-TF is not involved with any specific implementation of these technologies.  <br>    <br>  4.  This special notice seeks to identify interested parties who wish to present new or improved technologies to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office.  All material presented or discussed must be unclassified.  The UAS-TF and its consultative body include, or may include, Government individuals from the Architecture and Technology Branch of the UAS PO, and subject matter experts from the UAS PO that pertain to the subject matter presented.  No SETA or Contractors will be present; therefore, no NDAs should be necessary.  The Government shall have in place sufficient physical accommodations so that proprietary material may be shown to the Government at the option of the TF presenters.  The UAS PO Security Officers and Legal professionals will be present.  Details related to ongoing or possible future acquisition activities or plans within DoD or any of the Services will not be discussed.  <br>    <br>  5.  To further facilitate communications and input from interested parties, UAS-TF will be held 12 March 2013, 0800-1600 and 13 March 2013, 0800-1600 at the AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL.  The Government will provide a closed session with the Architecture and Technology Lead and other subject matter experts within the UAS PO.  Industry is invited to present to this Technology Forum in a 30 minute appointed block of time, allowing 5 minutes for setup, 20 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for teardown.  The Government will provide a projector and power outlets.  Presenting company must provide a laptop if deemed appropriate for the presentation.  Government requests five hardcopies of the presentation, which will be closely held and protected at the conclusion of the brief.  The Government will honor appropriate proprietary markings of the presenting company.  Presentations must contain presenters' names and contact info to include email addresses and phone numbers.  Interested parties wishing to participate in UAS-TF should register on or before 1 March 2013 by emailing jennifer.t.beck@us.army.mil.  Please follow email requests with a phone call to Jennifer Beck at 256.876.5515 to ensure that your contact info and description of technology to be presented has been received.

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for vendors that are capable of performing software integration services, technical support and consulting services for the continuation of the design, development and implementation of the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) Unified Contracting System (UCS). The period of performance for the contract will be one base plus three option years.

The FAAs current legacy procurement systems are based largely on paper-based manual processes, record-keeping and documents. Although some steps in the FAAs procurement processes are automated, a fully integrated and automated tool is not available to effectively support FAA procurements. 

The FAAs strategic vision for implementing  UCS is  to meet the future acquisitions and procurement demands for the design, development, integration and implementation of the new the Purchase Card Purchase System 2nd Generation (PCPS2), Electronic document management and storage (eDocS), as well as unified contracting modules including automated procurement processes pre-award, post-award for eFAST and Agency-wide; contract writing, statement of work generation, invoicing, requisition to obligation and rate engine. The implemented UCS modules will enable the FAA to effectively and efficiently meet the FAAs demanding procurement needs.

This is a market survey for the manufacture/purchase of Pulse Forming Network (PFN) assemblies used in the Airport Surveillance Radar 9 (ASR-9) system.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
   
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses that are interested in and capable of manufacturing the required PFN assemblies. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The FAA requires the following (limited to 25 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with the attached PFN drawings:

      - Type of products/services provided by your firm
      - Size and type of products/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)                                
      - Number of years in business

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources. Only small business sources shall respond to this sources sought synopsis.
<p><br />Project Title: Training and Instructional Services</p>
<p>Project Description: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a continuing need to train its field and headquarters personnel to be knowledgeable of the laws and regulations, scientific concepts and standards related to FDA-regulated program areas. The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) is one of the FDA's Field and Headquarters inspection components that works to achieve compliance of regulated products through inspections, outbreak investigators and responses to emergencies involving regulated products and affecting the public health. FDA-regulated products currently include, but are not limited to: Foods (Manufactured, Retail, Shellfish and Milk), Feed, Biologics, Drugs, Devices, Tobacco, Radiological Health, Laboratory, Veterinary Medicine, Emergency Response and other multi-program areas under the Agency's authority. The purpose of this project is to obtain the services of a contractor to supply necessary and qualified personnel capable of providing instructional services or curriculum development for training courses for FDA-regulated products. The Contractor must have sufficient&nbsp;personnel and capacity to provide multiple instructional and developmental services simultaneously throughout the year, as over 200 classroom courses are being delivered across the nation to FDA's regulatory stakeholders. In addition, the course content shall be developed, updated and/or blended for other mediums for delivery, such as online courses or webinars, as needed to meet the growing needs of the FDA.&nbsp;FDA instructors, Project Officers and/or other resource persons will be used as monitors, proctors, and instructors in the program area, as their expertise is considered necessary by FDA to manage course development and delivery. Specific dates and number of courses, by commodity or in total, are subject to change, but will be confirmed annually and adjusted as necessary throughout the year.&nbsp;Course Advisory Group (CAG) and other meetings regarding tasks and deliverables shall be conducted at facilities in the Continental United States (CONUS), or via conference calls or webinars selected by FDA/ORA. Classroom Training will be delivered within the United States and its Territories, and, on rare occasions, travel may be non-CONUS with consent from FDA/DHRD. The Contractor may suggest location(s) for material development based on needs.</p>
<p>Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 15 pages (font size Times New Roman 11 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted (but not in place of the responses to the below questions). The anticipated period of performance is 12 months, plus four 12-month option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and must respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? <br />2. Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? <br />3. If disadvantaged, specify if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? <br />4. Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? <br />5. Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? <br />6. Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned or Veteran-Owned business? <br />7. Demonstrate your recognition and ability to overcome potential difficulties in the performance of the project.<br />8. Describe the rationale for your plan to perform the tasks described above and the relationship to comparable work in progress elsewhere.<br />9. Describe relevant experience in fulfilling work similar in size and scope to the tasks described above, and identify other organizations for which you have acted as a Contractor while participating in the same or similar efforts.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to:</p>
<p>Attn: James G. Whitt<br />U.S. Food and Drug Administration<br />Office of Acquisitions and Grant Services<br />5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2081<br />Rockville, MD 20857</p>
<p>Electronic mail responses will be accepted at: James.Whitt@fda.hhs.gov. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received in writing, by no later than March 20, 2013, 4:30 PM, Eastern Time.</p>
<p>No solicitation is currently available. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offerors list, or a request to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reference No. 1113339.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.

Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

The bidder must be the owner of the GSA schedule in order to bid and to be considered for award. Bids that do not comply with this offer term will be removed from consideration. By proactively complying with this offer term, Sellers accept that the Government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee. Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the Government and receive payment from the Government. <BR> <BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items.

Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (WSS), Mechanicsburg, PA released solicitation N00104-12-R-Q527 on August 07, 2012 with the intent to negotiate for professional, technical, and management support services in the following areas:  Business Process Management/Reengineering/Optimization, Data Governance/Operations/Analysis, and Business Intelligence for the NAVSUP Business Systems Center (BSC), Mechanicsburg, PA. The solicitation included a base period of one year with three one-year option periods. The procurement was solicited under FAR Part 15 and a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract was anticipated. The solicitation stated that at least one award will be and as many as two awards may be reserved for small businesses that otherwise are determined to be responsive, qualified, competitive, and responsible pursuant to the terms identified in the solicitation.
 The applicable NAICS code was 561210.
 This solicitation closed on September 06, 2012. Following the closing of the solicitation, services within scope were added to this effort, which has increased the magnitude (size) of the original effort. The scope of the original effort included professional, technical, and management support services in the following areas:  Business Process Management/Reengineering/Optimization, Data Governance/Operations/Analysis, and Business Intelligence. The customer(s) associated with this requirement has also changed. While NAVSUP BSC is still a customer, the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) and, potentially, other foreign customers have been added to this requirement.
 In addition, foreign travel is now required for this requirement. The anticipated duration of the requirement has changed. The amended solicitation will include a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The solicitation is still being solicited under FAR Part 15 and a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract is still anticipated. In addition, the solicitation will still state that at least one award will be and as many as two awards may be reserved for small businesses that are otherwise determined to be responsive, qualified, competitive, and responsible pursuant to the terms identified in the solicitation. The applicable NAICS code is still 561210.
The amended solicitation will be released via NECO/FedBizOpps on or about 20 March 2013 with a closing date of 19 April 2013.
 Questions must be submitted in writing to Jennifer.N.Jones@navy.mil.

This project is competitive under the 8(a) program under NAICS Code 541990. This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds. The purpose of this project is to provide comprehensive broad, focused, and/or intensive training and technical assistance (TTA) to federally-recognized tribes and other American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN/) communities, seeking to address and prevent mental and substance use disorders, suicide, and promote mental health. This contract shall use a culturally relevant, evidence-based, holistic approach to support native communities in their self-determination efforts through infrastructure development, capacity building, as well as program planning and implementation. The TTA contractor shall specifically provide proactive planning/implementation of substance abuse prevention and mental health programming focused on native children, youth, and their families to (1) decrease the impact of risk factors, such as poverty, unemployment, racism and historical trauma that contribute to suicide, family disruption, youth violence including bullying, and high-risk substance use, and (2) increase the protective factors, such as strengthening cultural identity, a sense of family and community connectedness, and communication skills, that are linked to the healthy and safe development of AI/AN children and their families. Through collaboration and coordination with internal and external TTA providers and other native-focused organizations, the contract shall get the best value for limited prevention resources, tailoring the tools necessary to increase community protective factors that can serve to reduce suicide, violence, and substance abuse.<br />The focus of this contract is to address and prevent mental and substance use disorders, suicide, and promote mental health in native communities and families by providing culturally relevant and meaningful TTA that honors tribal culture and ways of life as well as respects and protects government-to-government relations.

<DESC>GSN VERY BROADBAND BOREHOLE SEISMOMETER REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY This is a request for information (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is not a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The purpose of this request for information is in support of market research being conducted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet a prospective need for very broadband borehole seismometers and to gather information on current products, technologies, and capabilities within the market.  This synopsis is for acquisition planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. 
All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience/capabilities in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, joint ventures etc.) Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research. 
In accordance with FAR 19.5, Set-Asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, if a solicitation follows. Offerors are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  Any follow-on procurement strategy will be based on the results of the information provided from Offerors and available funding.
In accordance with FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: FAR 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "Offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of soliciting industry's best ideas for a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or modified very broadband borehole seismometer. Interested companies should respond with information on their current commercial product(s) and how they might address the capability for adapting them to meet the USGS requirements.
As a result of this RFI, the USGS is requesting a technical capabilities statement that will address the items outlined in the RFI from potential Offerors. If a potential Offeror is unable to provide a total solution, the Offeror is encouraged to submit information and propose the resources (including factors like time and financial assistance) needed to develop or compliment their proposed solution. Elaborate proposals or very detailed pricing information are not required. Any innovative and new conceptual ideas to achieve the USGS objectives are encouraged.
Proposed Requirement Overview/Objectives The USGS has a requirement for broadband borehole seismometers for the Global Seismographic Network. The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is a permanent, digital network of more than 150 modern stations in over 80 countries, from the South Pole to Siberia and from the Pacific basin to the southern tip of Africa.  The GSN was formed in 1986 as a partnership among the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS, a university consortium) and serves as a multi-use scientific facility and societal resource for monitoring, research, and education.  See Attachments 1 and 2 for the anticipated specifications for this requirement. The USGS requires three-component very broadband borehole seismometers that meet these specifications.  The specifications given in Attachment 1 assume that the sensor is a traditional force feedback system with three analog outputs which are digitized outside of the seismometer. The USGS is also willing to consider digital solutions if the resulting sensor/system has comparable (or improved) bandwidth, dynamic range, noise performance, and physical characteristics; the specifications for digital solutions are in Attachment 2.  The USGS has a moderate preference for analog sensors because of the existing data acquisition systems at the stations.
Interested companies should respond no later than 5 April 2013 with information on their current commercial product(s) and how they might address the development of very broadband borehole seismometers that would meet the proposed specifications. Responses should include information regarding company background/experience, personnel, and facilities. Product information provided should include cost estimates, detailed technical information (i.e., technical literature, independent or pending laboratory test data, capacity data, as well as illustrations, photographs, any relevant patents. Firms responding should indicate whether or not they are small, and women-, veteran-, and/or minority-owned businesses. A point of contact, telephone and fax numbers, web address, and e-mail address should be provided. Any information/samples submitted will not be returned (unless return arrangements are agreed upon beforehand). This Request for Information (RFI) of potential sources is a required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties in order to minimize cost both to potentially interested parties and the Government. A determination of the contract type, mechanism for procuring the product and possible set-aside status will not be made by the Government until the conclusion of market research. No formal proposals are being requested under this synopsis. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334513 and the size standard is 500 employees.
Responses to this notice are to be sent electronically via e-mail to Christine Leonard, cleonard@usgs.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Novitas Solutions, Inc. under contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0001Z in the amount of $9,370authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The work to be performed is aligned within the core scope of duties; however, the contractor is being directed to perform additional work. MACs shall enter data into the HITECH Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12 month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted, MACs shall update the data in FISS within five business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet arrested and received their initial payment). In addition, MACs shall review and determine an allowable amount for critical access hospital incentive payments, once submitted by the hospital. MACs shall complete its review and enter the allowable amount in FISS within 30 days of receipt of the documentation.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

________________________
Estimated Total $360,571.00

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  FAR 6.302-1(b) (2) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:  The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes doesn't allow for any other company to provide this service.

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The Advisory Board Company is a global research, technology, and consulting firm partnering with 150,000 leaders in 3,700+ organizations across health care and higher education.  Through vast network and innovative membership model, 'The Advisory Board Company' collaborates with healthcare executives and their teams to elevate performance and solve their most pressing challenges. In addition, they provide strategic guidance, actionable insights, web-based software solutions, and comprehensive implementation and management services. The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes doesn't allow for any other company to provide this information. The Advisory Board Company is the only firm that offers organizational memberships to any of its various memberships.  

6.  Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: This acquisition will be synopsized on FedBizOpps as required in FAR 5.2041.  

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   
The standard commercial rates for the base/award for the three annual memberships would cost $206,928.00 and are as follows:

"	Health Care Advisory Board Membership $92,232 
"	Clinical Advisory Board Membership $70,740.00
"	Nursing Executive Center $43,956 
        
The standard commercial rate for the award year is $206,928.00 and the option year is $206,928.00 for a total of $413,856.00.The Government rates for the base year on all three annual organizational memberships combined is $175,888.00 and the option year is $184,683.00 for a total of $360,571.00.  The standard commercial rate is $413,856.00, and the government rate is $360,571.00 which is a savings of $53,285.00 over the duration of two years.

8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The Acquisition Liaison Group conducted market research on 12-5-2012 and 12-13-2013 using Google and GSA Advantage to attempt to identify other potential vendors with ability to provide the government required products.  Market research discovered that the three memberships identified are the sole property of "The Advisory Board Company".  These memberships are proprietary service/materials of 'The Advisory Board Company'; there are no other vendors that can provide the sale of these memberships. Wanakee Strickland (CS) also conducted market research on 01/11/2013 through VetBiz.gov, and SBA.gov and found that there weren't any vendors able to provide the memberships. Wanakee Strickland contacted Alexis Drumheller with the Advisory Board Company on 01/14/2013 to verify that the Advisory Board owns sole rights to the memberships. It has been determined that the Advisory Board is the only company that can provide the memberships.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  There is no other pertinent information to be considered.

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  There were no other interested parties.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Prior to exercising government's Option Year, market research will be conducted to determine and validate if any other vendors have come into the marketplace that can meet the needs of the government.

ATRA's distance learning events provide the required training, support materials as well as the practical experiences in the profession of recreation therapy; these attributes are critical skills and knowledge needed for the healthcare providers that care for our veterans nationwide.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The ATRA pricing has remained constant from the Fiscal Year 2012 (PO # C27017) rate of $225 per course registration.  In addition, ATRA's fees for the same services in Fiscal Year 2011 and 2010 (PO # C17080 and C07093) were at a rate of $290 per course registration.  The differential is approximately 22% less than the rates in Fiscal Year 2010 and 2011.  The $225 per registration is considered fair and reasonable. 

Further, contracting these commercially available learning events provides the government a cost efficient and timely means of providing recreation therapy training nationwide.  Recreating this training would entail extensive instructional development design, man-hours for training content that currently exists.  This type of work takes many months to complete and is very expensive.  Furthermore, new curriculum would not be an improvement over existing ATRA audio teleconference training series.    

8.  Description of Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Extensive internet Google, Yahoo and GSA Advantage research failed to yield any other potential vendors with the ability to provide the government required services.  Market research discovered that the services identified are from the American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA); this is proprietary service/materials and therefore no other vendors can provide this service.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  There are no other facts in support of this other than full and open competition determination.

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Prior to exercising government option years, market research will be conducted to determine and validate if any other vendors have come into the marketplace that can meet the needs of the government. This justification for supporting the use of other than full and open competition will be posted at the Government Point of Entry (FedBizOps.gov) once fully executed.

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1.  

      (x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will  
                   Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
      (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
      (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
                   or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;

      (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above:  ATRA is the only firm that offers live teleconferences distance learning events required by the VHA Recreation Therapist community of practice.  ATRA's distance learning events provide the required training, support materials as well as the practical experiences in the profession of recreation therapy; these attributes are critical skills and knowledge needed for the healthcare providers that care for our veterans nationwide.  Also, the medical practice approaches outlined by ATRA will aid in the movement from a 'disease model' of care into a patient centered 'wellness model'. ATRA distance learning services will place VA in a position of being the best approach to assist VHA's continuum of care and improved patient care for those that seek recreation therapy services.  There are absolutely no other product/s that will meet VA's needs.  

ATRA is approved as a Continuing Education Unit (CEU) authorized provider through the International Association of Continuing Education and Training as well as the only professional organization that offers this training exclusively for recreational therapists. ATRA teleconference training sessions dovetail into the annual national training seminar widely attended by VHA Recreational Therapists.

6.  Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This acquisition will be synopsized on FedBizOpps as required in FAR 5.2041.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The ATRA pricing has remained constant from the Fiscal Year 2012 (PO # C27017) rate of $225 per course registration.  In addition, ATRA's fees for the same services in Fiscal Year 2011 and 2010 (PO # C17080 and C07093) were at a rate of $290 per course registration.  The differential is approximately 22% less than the rates in Fiscal Year 2010 and 2011.  The $225 per registration is considered fair and reasonable. 

Further, contracting these commercially available learning events provides the government a cost efficient and timely means of providing recreation therapy training nationwide.  Recreating this training would entail extensive instructional development design, man-hours for training content that currently exists.  This type of work takes many months to complete and is very expensive.  Furthermore, new curriculum would not be an improvement over existing ATRA audio teleconference training series.    

8.  Description of Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Extensive internet Google, Yahoo and GSA Advantage research failed to yield any other potential vendors with the ability to provide the government required services.  Market research discovered that the services identified are from the American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA); this is proprietary service/materials and therefore no other vendors can provide this service.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  There are no other facts in support of this other than full and open competition determination.

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Prior to exercising government option years, market research will be conducted to determine and validate if any other vendors have come into the marketplace that can meet the needs of the government. This justification for supporting the use of other than full and open competition will be posted at the Government Point of Entry (FedBizOps.gov) once fully executed.
