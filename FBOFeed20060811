<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award sole source procurement to Voith Hydro Siemens for the purchase of the WaterView 2000 optimization package.  The Bureau of Reclamation partnered with Tennessee Valley Authority and Hydro Resource Solutions to enter into a research agreement to develop a prototype optimization package to be tested under actual operating conditions to determine overall desirability of the package for use at Grand Coulee Powerplant.  The primary objective of the ongoing effort was to identify and qualitatively evaluate the WaterView 2000 optimization package as a tool that can improve the overall operating efficiency of powerplant facilities such as Grand Coulee in Reclamation's Pacific Northwest Region.  As Hydro Resource Solutions (owned and governed in part by Tennessee Valley Authority) developed and modified the system to meet Reclamation needs, there is no other source for this specialized system.  Hydro Resource Solutions no longer is affiliated with the Tennessee Valley Authority, but rather affiliated with Voith Hydro Siemens.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the pending requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide similar requirements must provide supporting evidence (procures, product data, etc.), to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement.  Do not submit quotations.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 423490 which is 100 employees.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512, Computer Systems Design Services.   The Solicitation/Request for Capability Statement number is 1406-04-06-RC-63154.   All documents applicable to this pre-solicitation notice will be available via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/Solic/openmarket.asp.   Entire presolicitation notice with additional details, Past Performance Template, Attachment 1; Oracle Staff / Resources Vendor Competencies Matrix Template Attachment 2.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this Presolicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.  Please ensure the Request for Capability Statement (RFC) number 63154 and program title (Oracle Federal Financial System Support for the National Business Center) is referenced on all correspondence.   Telephone requests for this Presolicitation Notice cannot be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.   ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS:  This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.  Phase 1 consists of the submission of the Vendor Capability Statement, agency evaluation of the capability statement, and subsequent advisory notification to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.  Phase 2 consists of the solicitation conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), proposal evaluation, and competitive range determination, oral presentations and award.  This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit a detailed technical and price proposal, management plan, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify two SAMPLE task scenarios to be priced.  To ensure that the Government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors who are most highly rated and are in the competitive range will be provided an opportunity to participate in oral presentations.   PHASE 1:  SUBMISSION OF VENDOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT, GOVERNMENT EVALUATION AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATION   This phase includes submission of the Vendor Capability Statement followed by Government evaluation and advisory notification.  The program Background and Sample Support Activities are included below for the purpose of providing background information required to participate in this acquisition. Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1.  The capability statement Evaluation Criteria are included in this announcement. A. Submission of Vendor Capability Statement: Interested vendors are invited to submit a Capability Statement describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements must be submitted via email to Michael.Farrel2@mms.gov and shanda.georg@mms.gov no later than 2:00 PM, EST September 12, 2006.   Responding to this requirement which seeks contractor-developed solutions, requires a significant effort on the part of the contractor to propose to the Government.  It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the Government's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the Government's intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solution thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this contract award are asked to carefully review the attached Program Background, Sample Support Activities, and Capability Statement Evaluation Criteria documents to make a realistic self-assessment as to whether your organization has the experience and capacity to compete. B.  Government Evaluations: The Vendor Capability Statement will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions and Evaluation Criteria section.  The Government will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the vendors who provide submissions.   C.  Advisory Notifications: GovWorks will issue an advisory notification stating that the respondent will either be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  As explained in FAR 15.202(b), Advisory Multi-Step Process, "The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition." PHASE 1 - VENDOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT INSTRUCTIONS  The Government only expects a capability statement from qualified prime contractors.

NBC BACKGROUND The National Business Center (NBC) is an organization within the Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of the Secretary, and serves as the business arm for the Department in providing administrative and financial systems and/or services to DOI bureaus.  In 1999, DOI established the NBC to provide general administrative and financial services and systems across the Department and to other Federal agencies on a "service-for-fee" basis.  The NBC has an ongoing need for industry partners to assist in providing implementation and integrator support to current and potential customers of the Oracle Federal Financial accounting system and supporting Oracle enterprise and third party applications.  The NBC currently supports small (less than 1,000 employees) and medium (1,000 to 5,000 employees) Federal agencies with the Oracle accounting system and integrated support systems.  Future customers include large agencies as well.   The future number, size, and nature of the NBC's Oracle customers will directly depend on the NBC's and its supporting contractor's ability to offer competitive Best Value solutions as a Shared Services Provider (SSP) of the Federal-wide Financial Management Line of Business. The NBC is seeking a contractor with significant qualifications to assist the NBC in three (3) areas with regard to Oracle systems implementation, operations, and maintenance: (1) Implementation Proposal Preparation and Execution (2) Support for NBC Implementation Activities  (3) Support for Oracle Applications Operations and Maintenance To ensure it can provide Best Value to potential customers, the Government will select a contractor(s) as its primary Oracle partner(s).  The selected contractor(s) shall assist the Government in developing implementation price proposals to potential customers and shall serve as the implementation integrator where the Government is selected as the service provider by the customer.   SAMPLE SUPPORT ACTIVITIES General Information: The Government encourages teaming arrangements with other vendors to ensure that there are no instances where the Contractor's resources are unable to satisfy any or all requirements and timeframes.   1.  IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND EXECUTION  The Contractor shall work with the Government in preparing implementation proposals and providing implementation services for bringing customers online with the Oracle Federal Financial system.  This may also include implementation services for Oracle supporting enterprise modules or applications (e.g., iProcurement, Business Intelligence, etc.) or other product interfaces required by the customer (e.g., PRISM, Maximo, etc.) 1 (A) Implementation Proposal Preparation 1.	The Contractor shall take the lead in developing the technical approach and obtaining Government input and approval.  The technical proposal shall identify the Contractor as the integrator for performance of the implementation services, with the Government acting as project manager responsible for overseeing the agency implementation.  Table 1 - Contractor and Government Responsibilities below, identifies the Contractor's and Government's implementation roles.  2.	The Contractor shall assist the Government in developing the corresponding cost proposal for meeting customer implementation services requirements for the Oracle Federal Financial accounting system and all identified customer support systems.   3.	The Contractor and Government will each be responsible for developing their own cost estimates for their implementation responsibilities as designated in Table 1.   1 (B) Implementation Execution 1.

<SUBJECT>A -- Nanoscale Architectures for Coherent Hyper-Optic Sources (NACHOS)
<SOLNBR>BAA06-42
<RESPDATE>112106
<ARCHDATE>08112007
<CONTACT>Henryk Temkin, Program Manager, Phone 571-218-4681, Email henryk.temkin@darpa.mil
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The objective of the NACHOS program is to develop novel, ultra small lasers that are sub wavelength in all three dimensions, including the feedback structure integrated with the gain medium.  Specific program goals include:
	
•	Gain and feedback structures smaller than the wavelength of emitted light, sub wavelength in all three dimensions
•	Defect free media and low-loss feedback structures
•	Structures with lithographically defined placement and size 
•	Full computational modeling 
•	Sub wavelength&#61472;injection laser operating CW at room temperature with the free space emission wavelength that is less than or equal to 1.55 microns

Proposals which do not provide a well defined path to sub wavelength lasers are discouraged and will not be considered for this program. 

DARPA may consider compelling proposals with highly innovative technical approaches that fall short of the above program goals. Those offering such proposals should provide unambiguous physical arguments, based on data, simulations, and calculations, leading to estimates of practical and fundamental performance limits in operational parameters of the envisioned NACHOS laser.

The NACHOS program will be conducted in three Phases, each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics.  The period of performance for each of these Phases and the milestone schedule will be proposed by bidders within their technical proposals and will be factors considered as part of the source selection process.  In general, a shorter phase is preferable, but each Phase should clearly be adequate in duration to meet its objectives with reasonable risks and costs.  Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I. Demonstration of scalable gain medium; 
II.  Demonstration of effective sub wavelength feedback structures; 
III.  Modeling.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-42 Proposer Information Pamphlet referred below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Nanoscale Architecture for Coherent Hyper-Optic Sources (NACHOS) program will consist of a Phase I (duration of Phase I should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), followed by a Phase II and Phase III (duration of Phase II and Phase III should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Offerors wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Henryk Temkin, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA06-42@darpa.mil.

PROPOSER’S QUESTIONS

A “Proposer’s Questions,” website will be posted for BAA 06-42 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) is the senior NATO body responsible for promoting cooperation in research and development of technology in support of production and procurement of defense equipment among NATO nations. The CNAD is comprised of the most senior defense procurement officials from all NATO countries.  

As a result of the NATO June 2004 Istanbul summit, CNAD started an imitative to counter the threat of terrorist attacks. The CNAD Programme of Work on the Defence Against Terrorism (PoW DAT) involves ten specific efforts, including the Defence Against Mortar Attack (DAMA) initiative. DAMA is lead by the Netherlands, and it focuses on means and methods to counter the threat posed by terrorist use of mortars against static objects during peace operations.

In March 2007, a DAMA Proof of Concept Demonstration will be conducted at the Air Defence Firing Range in Todendorf, Germany (located on the Baltic Sea, east of Kiel). Live mortar firings will take place in realistic environments with many currently available systems as well as emerging technologies.  It is expected that practical solutions within all seven of the DAMA pillars (prevent, detect, warn, intercept, protect, attack and C2) will be presented.

Companies with products or services that can contribute to defending against mortar attacks will have the opportunity to showcase them to key operational officials from NATO member states.  Additionally, the event will serve as a venue for discussing improvements in interoperability between forces. 

ELIGIBLITY

While the deadline to receive an official invitation was 30 June 2006, it may be possible to still register if you are interested. The U.S. Department of Commerce was only recently notified about this exhibition.

Requests for participation sent directly to NATO cannot be considered. If your firm would like to apply for participation in this exhibition, you must first complete a Questionnaire that will be provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To request a copy of the CNAD Questionnaire, send an email to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov or Dnewsom@bis.doc.gov.  

The completed Questionnaire must be submitted to the CNAD Exhibition Team ASAP. Instructions for submission will be included with the Questionnaire. Also included will be background information on DAMA.

The selection of exhibitors will be completed by September 2006. NATO CNAD will inform all applicants, selected or not, about the results of the selection process. A handbook that will assist in the set-up for and conduct of the event, will then be sent to the selected exhibitors.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis, Synthetic siRNA libraries directed against (1) the druggable genome, (2) the GPCR genes and (3) genes involved in apoptosis with Qiagen Inc., 27220 Turnberry Lane Suite 200 Valencia, California 91355.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Synthetic siRNAs are duplex RNA oligonucleotides designed to target a specific sequence within an mRNA such that cleavage of that mRNA is mediated, leading to a highly defined decrease in the protein encoded for by that mRNA.  The sequence of each siRNA is unique and extensive bioinformatic analysis is required to ensure that a sequence chosen is predicted to have both maximum efficacy and specificity.

Qiagen Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that has accessed and further developed a proprietary algorithm that addresses these issues and thus the siRNA libraries produced by them are unique in composition.  Further the quality of the synthesized siRNA is critical for minimizing any toxic affect.  Qiagen uses a proprietary synthesize method for generating the oligonucleotides and a proprietary purification process to ensure a high quality product.  Further the libraries have been organized in such away as to enable rapid utilization of the siRNAs in the assay systems being developed for using these resources.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current research in progress.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST on August 21, 2006.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with PSS Bio Instruments Inc, 6052 Industrial Way, Suite H, Livermore, California 94551 blood and bone marrow reagents (kits) catalog number E8000.  

The supplies and services are commercial herein as defined in FAR Part 12 and this acquisition will be conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification code is 325188 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Requirement:  Purchase of a minimum of sixty-three (63) reagent kits and a maximum of one-hundred (100) reagent kits: eight (8) seven (7)ml bottles per kit: reagent shelf life shall be a minimum of 6 months from delivery date), with an option to purchase one (1) Magtration 8Lx Automated Nucleic Acid Purification System.  The instrument will be used to purify nucleic acid from blood and bone marrow samples.  In addition, the instrument must provide low to moderate throughput (5-10 samples/run) that is fully automated with pre-loaded reagent cartridges that can purify nucleic acid (DNA) from large volume starting samples (up to 7 ml).  Additionally, this instrument must provide an automated platform and robotics that allows maximum protection from DNA cross-contamination that is paramount in a clinical setting. The instrument is designed to use bar codes for samples, elution tubes, and reagent cartridge identification.  The instrument must elute the DNA into a 2-ml Eppendorf-type tube for future use and storage. Total purification time per run must be two (2) hours or less.  

Period of Performance: Base Year: September 4, 2006 – September 3, 2007 with four (4), twelve (12) month options.  

Justification:
 
Background:  Laboratory of Pathology performs molecular testing to assist in the diagnosis of a variety of cancers.   It is currently the only CLIA and College of American Pathology approved clinical lab within the NCI certified for performing molecular oncology testing on materials from NIH patients. Current molecular testing includes PCR assays for B and T cell clonality in lymphoproliferative diseases, identification of cancer associated viruses (e.g. EBV, HHV-8, HTLV-1,2), and the identification of cancer associated translocations (e.g., BCL-1, BCL-2, EWS-FLI-1, PAX-3-FKHR).  All tests are performed for diagnostic purposes and for Cancer Center protocol requirements. To achieve the first step toward the goal of making a diagnosis, the samples submitted must be treated to extract and purify DNA for subsequent polymerase chain reaction analyses.  

As the only CLIA and CAP certified molecular oncology laboratory in the Cancer Center, we provide support to a number of NCI principle clinical investigators. The majority of samples submitted to our laboratory for analyses are blood and bone marrow aspirates. These samples need to be handled with extreme care to insure that no nucleic acid cross contamination occurs during the DNA isolation, purification, and analyses procedures.   To facilitate this work within the NCI, reagents and an automated (robotic) nucleic acid purification system are required for this purpose.     

As a result of increased workload the molecular diagnostic service requires automated equipment dedicated for this support service.  Automation of the DNA extraction procedure will appreciably reduce work load and preparation time, and will improve quality control.   

It is the government's belief that PSS Bio Instruments, Inc, is the only known source manufacturing a low-moderate throughput (5-10 samples/run), benchtop instrument with the volume flexibility required (up to 7 ml) and technology required for continued research and diagnosis within the NCI.

<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), Boston MA to continue working with the States to acquire and analyze key components of the Vapor Recovery Stage II program to develop and provide information to EPA on strategies for states to phase out their State II program.  The Vapor Recovery program provides important public health protection by controlling evaporative air toxic and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, and is a critical component for states ozone attainment strategies.  The effectiveness of these programs may soon be jeopardized unless EPA makes timely decisions and provides clear guidance to the States.  NESCAUM has been working with EPA on this subject for over six years, and while EPA is making significant progress in addressing those issues, significant work still must be completed.  Critical to this effort is work with states to acquire and analyze key components of the State II program.  This work includes an analysis of potential metrics to establish a method to determine when widespread use of Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery (ORVR) systems occurs and to develop an addendum to the Comparability Study to include the impacts of ORVR and establish a method for Ozone Transport Region (OTR) states to phase out their Stage II program when it becomes redundant due to the significant fleet penetration of ORVR vehicles. In 2000 NESCAUM formed a vapor recovery workgroup consisting of representatives from all eight NESCAUM states.  After a year of this effort and given the importance of the program, STAPPA asked NESCAUM to take the lead in coordinating state efforts on Stage II.  NESCAUM has also included representatives from the non-NESCAUM OTR  states and other interested states such as Georgia and California.  The workgroup has directed NESCAUM to undertake a variety of efforts to gain a better understanding of the impacts of transitioning from Stage II to ORVR, as well as enhancing its existing State II program.  These efforts include an economic and environmental analysis of implementing CARB's Enhanced Vapor Recovery Program, an analysis of special phase-out requirements for the OTR, providing assistance to EPA in identifying issues related to vapor recovery, collecting state data related to vapor recovery, development of vapor recovery regulatory recommendations for the NESCAM states, and an alalysis of ORVR vehicle penetration.  In addition, NESCAUM has coordinated data acquisition and analysis conducted by EPA in its Options Paper entitled "Stage II Vapor Recovery: Issues and Options."  Over the past six years, NESCAUM has developed a unique expertise and relationship with state vapor recovery programs, including an understanding of the Stage II/ORVR transition issues, State Implementation Plan (SIP) issues as they relate to the states in the OTR and environmental impacts. Therefore, the services are deemed to be available only from the original source for this follow-on contract for the continued provision of unique knowledge, expertise, continuity and highly specialized services. The performance period is for approximately four months. The place of performance is at the contractor's site. The Statement of Work and any subsequent amendments or status may be viewed at http:www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Hard copies, CDs or disketts are not be available.

<DESC>The US Department of Agricultural Research Service in Maricopa, AZ has a need for a Covariance Measurement System: an eddy covariance system is needed for measurement of surface energy fluxes within agricultural fields. The system must be fully functional, including all ancillary supplies, software, hardware and mounting equipment. Not required are 12V storage batteries, which will be acquired independently. Measurements required are sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, C02 flux, soil heat flux, soil moisture content, net radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed. The system should include:
1. One 3-dimensional sonic anemometer.
2. One open-path H20 and C02 gas analyzer,
3. Air temperature and humidity probes with shielding.
4. One net radiometer with 2 replacement domes.
5. Two self-calibrating soil heat flux plates,
6. Two water content time domain reflectometers.
7. Two soil temperature, thermocouple probes.
8. Campbell data logger system with software sufficient to record data from instruments noted in items 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7. Note that "Campbell Scientific" is specified because of our need for compatibility with our existing data loggers, multiplexers, and software systems. The logger system must be able to record data streams from items 1 and 2 at 10 Hz sample rates and allow sufficient internal memory for storage to 30 days worth of continuous 10 Hz flux data. 
9. Solar panels, and associated voltage regulators sufficient to allow continuous operation of the eddy covariance system without external power sources.
10. Storage cases for all instrumentation to allow shipping and transport to different field sites.
11. All necessary mounting hardware for above items to provide a fully functional and field deployed eddy covariance system. The delivered products should constitute a turnkey system with fully programmed operational software. Alternatively., the total price should include costs required to ensure the system is fully-programmed shortly after delivery.  The USDA in tends on negotiating with the only known source Campbell Scientific for a turnkey system which will be compatible with our existing surface energy flux logging equipment.  A RFQ is not available for this requirement interested firms are encouraged to submit proposal to the attention of Fred Gifford as listed in this notice.

CTIT requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) assistance to develop a program to “jump-start” telecommunications policy development through effective training and to initiate and promote on-going telecommunications training in accordance with international standards. It would also expand ETC’s capability to improve the quality, universality and type of available telecommunications services in Ethiopia. By so doing, ETC would be better positioned to meet minimum consumer demand, promote economic development and ensure a continuing contribution to the national budget.  The program would be designed for management professionals, whose potential responsibilities and/or employment objectives require a greater understanding of telecommunications, including development of policies, regulatory reform and financial/tariffing procedures.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the ETA and ETC Personnel Training Technical Assistance include:

•	Site Visit and Preliminary U.S. Activities
•	Training Program and Capacity Building Implementation Planning
•	Training Program Implementation
•	USTDA Developmental Impact Analysis
•	Deliverables, including a Final Report 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $169,520 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount, and this particular Grantee is interested to know the willingness of the U.S. firm to work with local subcontractors.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM (Local Time), September 25, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB
BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.     THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.

A. INTRODUCTION:     The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We evaluate existing and/or modified commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) technologies for mobility applications.  The AMB capitalizes on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.     Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.     Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements in the area of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS).

This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."     Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.     THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 06, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.     AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 

B. OBJECTIVE:     Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs in the area of ECS.  White papers should contain proposals for using existing or modified COTS or GOTS items to reduce the overall deployment footprint, e.g., volume, weight, and/or size of the equipment needed to conduct and support MAF operations at deployed locations.  Footprint reduction should not come at the expense of durability, adequacy in capability and power, and usability in prolonged operations.

ECS equipment should be simple in design and minimize the need for special tools.  Equipment configurations should avoid/minimize the need for any special support equipment beyond off-the-shelf assets.  All special equipment/tools required for assembly will be organic to ECS systems/components.  ECS systems /components must be air transportable

ECS systems/components must be robust enough for diverse and harsh environments worldwide and operable in all climatic conditions.  Integrated ECS systems will provide the capability to support operations for an extended period.  ECS systems/components must withstand numerous and extended storage/deployment/use cycles.

ECS systems/components design must facilitate deployability, mission sizing, transportability, and storage.  Modularity for oversized or heavy items should be addressed and should not entail a large assembly burden on deploying forces.  

ECS systems must also be quick to:  set up, become operational upon arrival at the deployed location, strike when the deployed capability is no longer required, and be designed for ease of reconstitution or disposal.

AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander of the Air Mobility Warfare Center, the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander U.S. Transportation Command, and the Chief of Staff of the USAF. 

Submitters are encouraged to visit http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm to view a current list of AMB innovation areas.

C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:     Submitters are required to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference the BAA number with their submissions.

<SUBJECT>B -- Estimates of Cancer Recurrence Prevalence

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (ARP), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis the estimates of cancer recurrence prevalence from Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Roma, Italy. The SRAB has as one of its projects the development of new analytic approaches for the estimation of the three major population-based cancer progress measures (incidence, survival, and mortality) as well as prevalence. The SRAB is responsible for updating and improving prevalence statistics published in the Cancer Statistics Review, Report to the Nation, and Office of Cancer Survivorship website among others.  Projects have included the development of methods for estimating complete prevalence as well as cancer prevalence at the state level, qualifiers of prevalence such as prevalence by phases of care, prevalence of people receiving treatment for their cancer in different phases of the disease  and recurrence, i.e., survivors who will recur or who have already recurred. Because Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) collects information only at diagnosis the SEER database lacks information on recurrence. This project aims at estimating recurrence prevalence using SEER data and statistical modeling.  The usual prevalence estimates count people still alive with a prior diagnosis of cancer, regardless of their health status or ultimate curability of their cancer.  The methodology for this task will be based on estimating the 3 different prevalence quantities as specified below:  A)  Cure Prevalence (PA): Prevalence of people who will never recur and will never die of the disease;  B)   Non-Cure Prevalence (PB): Prevalence of people who will eventually recur;  B1) Recurrence Prevalence (PB1): Prevalence of People who are at the prevalence time in recurrence; and B2) Non Cured but still not in recurrence (PB2): Prevalence of People who will eventually recur and die of the disease but who are not in recurrence at the time of prevalence.  For the quantities above the following equations hold: Total prevalence= PA+PB and PB=PB1+PB2.  . However, since SEER does not contain information on recurrence a surrogate will be used for this survival distribution as explained below: If T is the time from diagnosis to cancer death for patients who will eventually recur (fatal cases), TF the time from diagnosis to recurrence (recurrence-free) and TR the time from recurrence to death the following relationship holds T=TF+TR.  The survival distribution for non-cured or fatal cases (T) can be estimated from cure survival models. It is assumed that the survival distribution after recurrence (TR) is the same as the survival distribution of cases diagnosed with distant disease. Thus, using the above equation (1) calculate the survival distribution of TF, the time to recurrence. The Instituto Superiore Di Sanita shall Calculate PA, PB, PB1 and PB2 for cancer sites specified in the following Cancers (breast, colorectal, prostate, lung and bronchus, corpus uterus, melanoma, bladder, cervix, stomach, ovary, thyroid, and oral cavity and pharynx) for males and females. They shall:  1)  Estimate the Cure fraction and the survival distribution of fatal cases;  2) Develop the algorithm and program to estimate the recurrence-free time for fatal cases using equation;  3) Combine the survival information with prevalence to estimate prevalence quantities PA, PB, PB1 and PB2; and 4)  Document the program for the methodology.  The Istituto Superiore di Sanita is uniquely qualified to perform the work outlined above and is the only organization known to the NCI Researcher that can perform the work.  Dr. Roberta De Angelis at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita will be responsible for managing and conducting the research.  She is a senior researcher in the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the National Center of Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion (CNESPS) within the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.  The Team from the Instituto Superiore di Sanita are leading experts in the development of the methods and application for estimating chronic diseases incidence and prevalence.  They have the background knowledge and are the only known source with the computer software which is not readily available within the research community.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 28, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Yale University School of Medicine, 310 Cedar Street, PO box 208023, New Haven, CT 06520 to perform Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) of immunofluorescent stains  performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) of invasive breast tumors collected from the DCEG’s population-based case-control study in Poland to investigate the etiology of breast cancer.  Tissue Microarray (TMA) technique, which permits the analysis of hundreds of tissue samples simultaneously using just a few slides, is ideally suited for epidemiological studies and Yale University has built TMAs for 1761 (842 cases in TMA1 and 919 cases in TMA2) invasive breast cancer tissues collected in the Polish case-control study.  The first set of TMAs (TMA1) has been stained for four markers (ER-&#61537;, ER-&#61538;, PR and HER2) using Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA™) analyses. This work demonstrated AQUA analyses of tumors represented in TMAs provide reliable, quantitative measures of immunofluorescent, which can be used to advance research on differences in cancer etiology based on stratification of tumors by marker expression.  In a continuation of an on-going study Yale University School of Medicine shall:  1) Perform AQUA analysis of TMA1 containing tissue samples from 842 Polish breast cancers with two-fold redundancy (i.e. 1,684 cores) for EGFR;  and 2) Perform AQUA analysis of TMA2 containing tissue samples from 919 cases with three-fold redundancy (i.e. 2,757 cores) for ER-&#61537;, PR, HER2, and EGFR.  These activities are required in order to: 1) identify molecular subtypes of breast cancer; 2) evaluate associations between tumor subtypes defined by marker expression and risk factors for breast cancer; and 3) evaluate associations between tumor subtypes defined by marker expression and survival and prognosis of breast cancer patients.Yale University is the only vendor known to the NCI Researcher that can perform the required AQUA analysis without the introduction of new variables in on-going research.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.   An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 28, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the services of Benjamin Hankey, Sc.D., St. Augustine, Florida.  The SEER database includes data on age, race, and sex of a cancer patient along with cancer site and type, stage, modality of first course of treatment, and patient follow-up all at the individual patient level.  This database is a unique resource for information on cancer patient prognosis.  However, there is a need to develop tools that can facilitate access to statistics on patient survival that can be obtained from the SEER database in order to better inform patients and clinicians on the subject of prognosis without the need for them to do data analysis.  To provide further usefulness of SEER survival data for information on patient prognosis, over the last two years staff in the SRP have developed the Survival Query System (SQS) for Clinicians.  Unlike the usual net survival estimates, which are produced for policy level analysis of cancer progress, the SQS provides crude estimates of survival in the presence of other causes.  The current system provides up-to-date estimates of prognosis by using the period method.  The SQS provides Information on the numbers out of 100, of survivors, deaths from cancer, and deaths from other causes for sequential follow-up periods through 10 years following diagnosis.  The cancer portion of survival and other causes are computed separately and joined using an assumption of conditional independence.  If the selected strata is considered too sparse (based on both the number in the survival cohort at time zero and the SE of the survival estimate at 10 years), then strata are pooled in reverse order of prognostic importance of the variable.   The system exploits the large sample size of the SEER database, by doing stratified analyses, rather than modeling across strata.  The SQS, Version 1.0, has been previewed and while the feedback has been generally favorable, issues have arisen as the SQS does not provide the incremental benefits of adjuvant therapy or exclusion criteria (e.g. for colorectal cancer patients, should it exclude those patients who do not have surgery, which is usually associated with significant comorbidities) and/or what descriptive information to provide for patients in a selected strata (e.g. treatment).  In addition further research is required on how the user interface should look, and how the system would be used by clinicians and patients. The workscope of this contract will require the development of crude survival rates for prostate cancer cases using SEER data for the time period of diagnosis 1988-2003.  Dr. Hankey shall:  1)  Establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG); 2) Solicit advice from the TAG; 3) Perform various test analyses using SEER data - to determine (a) review coding details of SEER data relevant to the development of the SQS estimates (e.g. years that both pathologic and clinical staging are available on the patients who have both);  (b) the strata which will be available in the SQS;  (c) sample sizes of different strata; (d) the impact of comorbidty on the cancer side of the equation; and (e) the prognostic significance of various covariates to determine which ones are needed as well as the order for collapsing strata when the sample size is small. Dr. Hankey is the only known source to the NCI researchers with this knowledge and expertise who can meet their needs.  Dr. Hankey recently retired as head of the Cancer Statistics Branch after 38 years at NCI.  In this position he was responsible for managing the SEER registry contracts, but was also responsible for the analysis and interpretation of trends in SEER data, as well as the development of new statistical methodologies.  In addition, he was involved in all phases of the development of Version 1.0 of the SQS.  Thus Dr. Hankey’s expertise and knowledge of SEER data, coupled with his knowledge of statistical and practical issues related to implementation of new cancer sites into the SQS, gives him unique experience and expertise not readily available within the research community. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on August  28, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.
A. INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that reduce mobility response times, reduce deployable support structures, increase deployed combat capability and effectiveness, and/or enable USAF members to do their job more efficiently.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 06, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 
B. OBJECTIVE:  Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs.  AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), has a requirement for maintenance of 46 unique computer processing systems currently in use at the NEIC, which is part of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).  These systems were designed by Mr. William Bennett and customized to meet the specific requirements of the ANSS for dependability, robustness, and performance.  The ANSS is currently running production software on 26 of these customized computers, and another 20 systems are being used in the development of ANSS production software.  Because these systems are used for monitoring in a mission critical system, immediate response to repair requirements is imperative.  Knowledge of and familiarity with the ANSS System is also imperative in order to provide timely resolution or problems.  Maintenance requirements are to include the following:  1) Local, on-site support available seven days per week; 2) Repair of critical components within 24 hours of notification of problem.  This may be repair of hardware components or Windows 2003 Server operating systems; 3) Trouble shooting, as required, either remotely or on-site; 4) Replacing faulty, or failed, hardware components, at the request of the USGS Project Officer.  A local Microsoft-Certified technician is required who is familiar with the architecture, components, and functionality of the 45 custom systems currently in use at the NEIC, as well as the ANSS System.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies specified as a sole source from Mr. William Bennett, Centennial, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (RFI/SOURCES SOUGHT) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.  The Sources Sought is issued for the purpose of determining if there are at least three (3) responsible Small Business concerns capable of meeting the requirement.     Interested firms should also reference their 8(a), HUBZone, service-disability veteran-owned status and their American/Alaskan Native Company (ANC) status.  The Government intends to use NAICS: 238150, Glass and Glazing Contractors, $13M Size Standard.  The US Department of State (DOS) has a requirement to devise methods of providing radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) attenuating glazing systems for its office buildings.  The current method of achieving this goal is through the application of aftermarket window film products that incorporate proprietary materials to provide the required attenuation.  While effective, this approach does present potential technical challenges and presents a life cycle cost burden.  The intent of this solicitation is to foster development of viable alternative methods of providing comparable RF/IR attenuation that are in consonance with traditional glazing techniques and compatible with industry accepted methods of utilizing glazing elements and manufacturing/assembling windows and glazed curtain wall systems.  While by no means an exhaustive listing, potential methods to accomplish this end would be to encapsulate an RF/IR attenuating material within conventional laminated glass interlayer materials such as polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or an ionoplast interlayer (e.g. DuPont’s Sentry Glass Plus) and a process of mechanically depositing an RF/IR attenuating material directly to a glass surface (e.g. “sputter coating”, pyrolytic deposition).  Interested Small Business concerns shall e-mail or fax a brief capability statement, signed by a corporate official with authority to bind the company and verify that the company meets the above requirements.  The capability statement shall not exceed five (5) pages, and must describe the company's ability to meet the above technical and security requirements.  The statement shall be transmitted either by e-mail or fax to littleft@state.gov or (fax)(703) 875-6006, by 2:00 p.m. EST on August 21, 2006.  Competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research.  At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation.  This notice is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.  PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND VOICE MESSAGES WILL NOT BE RETURNED.

<DESC>The Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to demonstrate the military utility of using Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) compatible and covert lighting on aerial refueling tanker aircraft.  Battlelab intent is to demonstrate a covert capability that enables in-flight operations in an NVIS environment.  Aircraft lighting should be capable of being visible only with the use of night vision devices.  To explore this concept, the Battlelab seeks innovative, low cost, commercial or government off the shelf lighting technology that can be temporarily installed on a KC 135 Stratotanker to make its exterior and boom pod interior lighting NVIS friendly/compatible and undetectable to the unaided eye.  The demonstration system must be capable of operating during all in-flight profiles and be compliant with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.  The exterior lighting must be NVIS friendly and covert so that it does not detract from safety or impede operations by degrading the vision of any aircrew members wearing NVGs during night air-to-air refueling, close wing formation, in-flight rendezvous, or other phases of in-flight operations.  The lighting should be friendly/compatible with all AN/AVS-9 and AN/AVS-10 NVGs.  The following exterior KC-135 lights require NVIS friendly capability for the demonstration: Wing Tip Navigation (NSN 6240-01-262-0148); Tail Cone Navigation (NSN 6240-00-044-6914); Upper and Lower Strobe (NSN 6620-01-358-9974); Underwing, Underbody, Multi Point Refueling System (MPRS) Outboard Nacelle & MPRS Horizontal Illumination (NSN 6240-00-132-5317); Pilot Director Indicator Letters (NSN 6240-00-155-7947); Pilot Director Indicator  Background (NSN 6240-00-155-7848); Pilot Director Indicator Arrow Strips (NSN 6240-00-132-5328); Aerial Refueling Flood (NSN 6240-01-512-7021); Wing Scanning (NSN 6240-00-132-5328); Boom Nozzle (NSN 6240-00-155-7824); Boom Nozzle w/Time Compliance Technical Order 1422 (NSN 6240-00-451-1409); Boom Marker (NSN 624000-683-0723).  The following boom operator interior lights must be NVIS compatible in accordance with MIL-STD-3009: Eye Brow Instrumentation (NSN 6240-14-200-2756); and MPRS Exterior Light Control Panel (NSN 6220-01-450-9535).  Through this request for information (RFI), the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice

Development of Integrating Hazard Mitigation into Local Planning

Description:

This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the proposed work.  It is anticipated that a Contractor will be required for the Integrating Hazard Mitigation into Local Planning.
Background: 
The preparation of local hazard mitigation plans as provided for and required by, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, has been a significant improvement in the way disaster mitigation planning is accomplished by local governments throughout the U.S.  The next major challenge for FEMA and the planning community is to ensure that other types of local plans have meaningful hazard mitigation components that tie into the local mitigation plan.  This is important because other types of local plans lead to action and implementation measures that may or may not support or reinforce objectives of the hazard mitigation planning.  Planning directors, city managers, and other public officials must have guidance on how to best integrate disaster mitigation into the full panoply of planning activities they are engaged in at the local level.  

Requirement: 
The contractor will develop and publish a Best Management Practices Report derived from academic research, the results of surveys, and a scoping symposium.  It is anticipated that this effort will comprise the first phase of a two phase effort, the second phase being the full development and publication of a Planning Advisory Service Report and related educational products for local planners. 

Tasks: 

Task 1 – Literature Search and Annotated Bibliography

The contractor will conduct a literature search on the integration of hazard mitigation planning into local plan making, resulting in an annotated bibliography of the available literature on the subject.  This will include books, research monographs, articles in serial publications and web-based publications, statutes, ordinances, and local plans.  The objective will be to identify best practices in achieving such integration across plan types.  

Deliverable: Annotated Bibliography




Task 2 – Survey of Best Practices

Concurrent with the literature search, the contractor will conduct an Internet-based survey of best planning practices and to seek information from scholars, practitioners, and other stakeholders in the process of integrating hazard mitigation into local planning.  The contractor’s research team will follow up on the most promising leads through interviews and requests for additional information as necessary in order to maximize what can be learned through this effort.

Deliverable:  Detailed resources and analysis of information obtained.


Task 3 – Symposium

Contractor will convene a 1-2 day scoping symposium at a site to be determined, to which it will invite the best scholars and practitioners available to discuss the integration of hazard mitigation into local planning with the goal of generating ideas and insights for managing the integration of hazard mitigation into local planning process.  

Deliverable: Symposium and scoping memorandum, including annotated outline/table of contents of the Report.


Task 4 – Best Management Practices Report

The contractor will prepare a written report for FEMA, summarizing the findings of Tasks 1, 2, and 3.  The report will identify and evaluate the most effective or promising management practices found during the literature search, survey and scoping symposium.  The report will be prepared in both paper and electronic format, suitable for publication and/or posting on FEMA’s web site.

Deliverable:  Best Management Practices Report

A response to his notice must address all of the following minimum capabilities: (1) the ability to conduct academic/professional research, (2) the ability to conduct surveys of academic/professional/stakeholder communities, (3) the ability to conduct professional/academic symposium(s), (4) the ability to produce written/electronic reports/finding. Documented evidence of experience and expertise in the capabilities must be provided.
Firms with these capacities who are interested in performing the proposed effort are invited to submit one original and three copies of complete information to the Contract Specialist identified in this notice within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the notice. Information furnished should include at minimum: (1) the firms professional qualifications, (2) the firms experience related to the proposed effort, (3) a description of any unique expertise related to the proposed effort, (4) other literature that supports the minimum capabilities listed above. 
This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. The Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Based on the responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority owned businesses. If the evaluation of responses concludes that none of the responding firms have the necessary capabilities, negotiations may be conducted with the American Planning Association on a noncompetitive basis. 
All questions regarding this notice shall be directed to the Contract Specialist via e-mail at: lynn.gardner1@dhs.gov

The total number of employees to be monitored for the year, conducted on a monthly basis from Sept1, 2006 to August 31, 2007 is forty-eight.
During the course of the year, personal monitoring will be conducted on fleet personnel while performing their routine work tasks in order to determine 8-hour-time weighted averages.   A minimum of two (2) personal breathing zone samples for potential asbestos 8-hour TWA exposure (taken over a full-work shift) shall be conducted on any given ship.  Sampling volume shall be sufficient for a detection limit equal to or less than 0.01 f/cc.  Analysis shall be done in accordance with NIOSH Method 7400, Revision 3.
All asbestos personal samples (employee exposure monitoring) shall be collected following the procedures specified in Appendix A to 29 CFR 1915.1001.  The sampling method described in the appendix represents the elements of the available monitoring methods, e.g. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7400.
In conducting the asbestos air sampling, determinations of employee exposures shall be made from the breathing zone air samples (i.e. attached to or near the collar or lapel near the worker's face) that are representative of the 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee.
The airborne monitoring shall be conducted in representative areas occupied by fleet employees who are performing work tasks required by their position.

Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposures shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full-shift exposure each employee in each job classification in each work area.
Representative 30-minute short-term employee exposures shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing 30 minute exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion limit for each job classification in each work area.
The Contractor shall prepare individual notification letters for each fleet employee sampled during the monthly asbestos air monitoring.  The letter shall contain the results of the employee's asbestos exposure monitoring performed under this contract.  Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet shall receive the letters within 15 calendar days after completion of the monthly asbestos surveys and asbestos air monitoring.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  FA4621-06-T-0102 is being issued as a Request for Quotation, which incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This acquisition is reserved for small businesses; however, the Government will accept proposals from all businesses.  In the event of insufficient small business participation, award will be made on an unrestricted basis.  The associated NAICS code for this acquisition is 336350.  McConnell AFB KS plans to acquire the following items.  Line Item 0001 - New/Replacement of Unserviceable Vehicle Exhaust System – 9 Each - SPECIFICATIONS FOR VEHICLE EXHAUST REMOVAL SYSTEM 
SYSTEM OPERATION 
The system shall remove all visible smoke from the exhaust for an adjustable time period of 10 to 99 seconds after the vehicle starts. The time of filter operation shall be easily set. 
The system shall also remove all visible smoke from the exhaust whenever the vehicle is in reverse gear. After the vehicle's transmission is shifted out of reverse gear, the system will continue in the filter mode for the pre-set time period. 
The system shall be completely automatic, not requiring action by any personnel at any time, with the exception of "normal maintenance." However, a manual override option is available to allow operation for service or special purposes. 
Normal functioning of the system is in no way detrimental to the operation of vehicle. Further, the system shall protect the engine by automatically preventing itself from activating when back pressure exceeds 1.8 PSI. At this time an indicator light on the cab dash shows that the filter requires changing. 
SYSTEM COMPONENTS 
The system shall consist of a filter, a diverter unit and an electronic control module, all of which are completely self-contained on the vehicle. Therefore the system may be operated at any time, regardless of the vehicle's location. 
The filter shall be made of a porous ceramic material designed and manufactured specifically to filter soot from diesel exhaust for a minimum of 30 filter operating hours. 
The diverter unit shall be installed in the existing exhaust pipe and shall direct the engine exhaust either through the filter element or through the muffler. The electronic control module, which drives the diverter unit, is conveniently mounted for access. The circuit board holds the timer control where the duration of the filter cycle is set. The board also features a series of LED lights that monitor each function of the system. An hour meter mounted in the electronic control module is designed to be used as a guide to determine when a filter is nearing replacement. 
System installation shall be completed and tested on fire trucks at the customer's location (McConnell AFB, Kansas). Additionally, the provider will explain the operation and maintenance of the system to the personnel who will be responsible of routine maintenance. 
A written warranty will be provided to insure that the system is free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one (1) year from the date of installation.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued separately. The solicitation number is FA5000-06-T-0058. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated FAR provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 and Class Deviation 2005-o0001. The DFARS provisions and clauses are those in effect to DCN 20060808. Purchase SIB broom cassette (part# SIB/MB-18/28-05) for MB Broom with 28 row Svenska cores.THIS REQUIREMENT IS FOR BRAND NAME ONLY. The intended source of this requirement is Myslik, Inc., as this is the only authorized dealer of SIB Broom Cassette in North America.  The SIB core comes with nylon inserts designed to absorb all the wear that the extrusions have incurred with replacement cost being a fraction of that expense.  Nylon insert replacement is now required and is available on the new SIB core which has a five year warranty.  In order to maintain the 5-year warranty for these cores, SIB cassettes must be used with these cores.  Use of other brands would void the warranty and cause excessive wear to the core.  Prior to 2005, broom cassettes were solicitated as “brand name or equal” but because of the damage sustained to the runway sweepers, it has been determined that brand name is in the best interest of the government. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Offers will be evaluated based on technically acceptable, low price. Each offeror shall comply with the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Commercial Items by filling the information out on the following website http://orca.bpn.gov.

The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price, performance-based, commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) RFQ-COM-06-15. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.

BACKGROUND: The Aberdeen Area IHS is establishing a mobile women’s health clinic with broadband telemedicine capabilities to provide quality health care to Native American women in ten underserved communities in the area.  The Mobile Digital Telemammography (MDT) Project Aberdeen Area has been designed to offer mammography and breast ultrasound examinations, cervical cancer screenings, and other health assessments and education services to Native American women.  

The broadband satellite telecommunications capability on the MDT unit will transmit digital images to a contracted reading center for immediate interpretation.   The use of digital imaging in combination with broadband satellite communications will allow radiologists to read mammograms while the patients are still at the clinic.  With this broadband link, the mobile clinic can go anywhere that is convenient for the patients in the widespread rural areas of North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska.  A distant radiology department equipped with digital mammography reading equipment will interpret images and transmit reports back to the mobile clinic while the patient is still there.  This innovative approach is intended to reduce the patient anxiety that comes while waiting for the results of a mammogram.  Such anxiety sometimes causes patients to defer screenings until serious problems occur.  

The purpose of the contract is for the provision of a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) and Radiology Technologist who is digital mammography trained. Currently only mammograms, bone density, and women’s health education services are provided on the MDT unit. Workflow on the MDT unit has typically ranged from 11 - 15 patients per day with potential to increase as staff efficiency increases.  A digital mammography examination will be followed by the other women’s health services (bone density, health education), keeping patients productively occupied while the images are transmitted and interpreted by remote radiologists. The staff will receive an orientation and training on appropriate equipment once onsite. The hourly rate is an all inclusive rate.

DISCUSSION OF PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES: Provider staffing requirements contained in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) are considered performance based, focusing on the Aberdeen Area’s desired results and outcomes.  The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the most effective means by which these requirements will be fulfilled.  In order to fulfill the requirements, the Contractor shall implement a recruitment and placement process and systems that will deliver the required services in a manner that will best meet the IHS performance objectives.  These performance based requirements represent a challenge to the Contractor to develop and apply innovative and efficient approaches for achieving results and meeting or exceeding the performance objectives and measures described in the PWS. Contractor is paid at an all inclusive rate. Travel and per diem costs are the sole responsibility of the contractor. The IHS will monitor the Contractor’s performance in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) (See Attachment 1). 

Services shall begin as indicated by the attached schedule which is subject to change with little notice.  The Contractor will provide a Radiology Technologist-Mammographer to perform digital mammograms and bone density exams, participate in refining patient flow, and participate with orientation activities for MDT sites. The LPN will be the point of contact for the Aberdeen Area Office and the local sites. The LPN will be instrumental in assuring patient flow is seamless and will be trained to perform bone densities by the Radiology Technologist. 

Contract staff shall be motivated and capable of functioning independently with minimum oversight to assure both clinical and non-clinical activities are completed. Non-clinical activities may consist of interaction with Service Unit/Clinic staff and Radiologists, documentation on Patient Care Component (PCC), and various forms of communication with Service Unit staff for follow-up of abnormal tests.

Contractor will ensure staffs are informed that the MDT unit is not a clinic nor is it a hospital and light housekeeping duties are a necessity in maintaining a clean environment in a compact unit. Staff shall function as a team.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information  may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehi cle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will  be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these  gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting  commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for del ivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing gr eater than 12'-5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Mai n Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures  and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Ga te Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center  gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate,  as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the L ogistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4 132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast  Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Acc ess Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employ ee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two  (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next w ork day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the G overnment may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reprod uction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, the ft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by O SHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, c ollect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the F ast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the  installation.

<DESC>Answer to question for Request for Proposal for the Lightweight and Industrial Dry Suits:  

QUESTION 42:  Does the lightweight suit’s neck gasket need to be covered (for UV protection) when the detachable collar is removed from the suit?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The neck seal shall be ozone resistant (see paragraph 1.7) and have a neck seal protective strap (see paragraph 1.8).  This requirement is independent of the need for a detachable storm collar (see paragraph 2.2).

QUESTION 43:  For CLIN 0002 the solicitation states "The contractor shall provide prices for repair services for components typically damage by routine wear and tear."  In the Supplies and Prices section, the solicitation states: "The USCG anticipates maintenance/repair services for approximately 3,000 suits in ordering periods four and five of the contract, and the other DHS OEs anticipate maintenance/repair services for approximately 30 suits in ordering periods four and five of the contract, for a total of 6,060.  Offerors shall provide unit prices for each CLIN in each of the ordering periods of the contract, based on the estimates provided herein for each year.   The total contract price shall be calculated by multiplying each unit price by the estimated number of units ordered per year for each CLIN, then totaling all CLINs for each ordering period within the contract to derive the overall total price for the purposes of evaluating the Total Evaluated Price."  The problem is that the solicitation asks the offeror to provide prices for maintenance/repairs services, plural.  However, the instructions for calculating the total evaluated price states that the offeror needs to multiply the price by 6060.  What should be used for the CLIN 0002 price since not every suit will require all the repairs listed in the list of repair services and most suits won't require any repairs?
ANSWER:  As per the solicitation, the offeror shall provide a single, unit price for the maintenance/repair services, multiplying the price by 3,060 per year.  

For purposes of award, the total evaluated price will be based on the price of delivered suits (Lightweight and Industrial) and the monthly report only.  The price proposed for maintenance services will be evaluated for price reasonableness, but, will not be included in the total evaluated price for purposes of determining award.

(2) Past performance history (current or within the last 18 months) on projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number).  References will be checked to validate the information provided and to determine reliability/dependability.  (3) Key personnel (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with relevant qualifications and specific experience. Cost Proposal:  provide Firm Fixed-Price.  Offerors must submit an original and two copies of the proposal to Jess Maanao, USCG Headquarters Support Command, Code A-3, Room B411, 2100 Second St. SW, Washington, DC  20593.  Electronic transmissions to jmaanao@comdt.uscg.mil are acceptable, but must be timely.  Proposal Evaluation Criteria: (1) Price and price-related factors.  (2) Technical approach.  (3) Past performance of your organization, including adherence to schedules and budgets, the acceptability of previous products delivered, effectiveness of program management, and the offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties. This will be a Best-Value award determination.  Price and Past Performance will be a factor, but technical factors are far more important.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations clauses are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items(Mar 2005), 52.212-4(Sept 2005), 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders-Commercial Items(Feb 2006)52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003). 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (April 2002). 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Dec2001). 52.222.36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (June 1998). 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans fo the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Dec 2001). 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain  Foreign Purchases (Dec 2003). 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003)  Offerors can retrieve these clauses on the INTERNET at www.arnet.gov.  Questions about this requirement must be in writing and submitted by fax or e-mail. Telephone inquiries are strongly discouraged. All inquiries must include the solicitation number, your full name, organization name, address, phone and fax numbers, and must be received by 12:00 (noon) ET, August 9, 2006.  It is the responsibility of the Offeror to ensure the proposal is received by the date and time shown above.  

Question and Answers-1) Is there an incumbant?   No 
2) Recent Homeland Security guidelines have changed claiming that all meeting must be held in federal/govt facilities. Does this apply to this proposal? From the requirements it seems that a hotel facility may be better suited for this conference.  There was an issue ragarding a group at DHS who had a meeting that was investigated.  DHS actually asked us to do the contract for their October retreat.  There was noyhing promulgated to all DHS entities as reasoned below.  All venues that can meet the requirements are invited to submit a proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60115-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-11.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Technology Transfers Branch (TTB) plans to enter into a IDIQ contract for a one year base period with four one-year option periods with an organization to enhance the current Technology Information Management System (TIMS) database with enhanced features and re-program TIMS to maximize the capabilities of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.  Base Year: Minimum 300 hours; Maximum 1,335 hours, for each of the four one-year option periods Minimum 100 hours; Maximum order 1,335 hours.

The North American Industry Classification code is 541511, and the business size standard is $21M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  
	General Description: The Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) of the Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) converted eight (8) individual and separate flat files of varying record size from FileMaker Pro (FMPro) version 4.1 into a FMPro 6.0 relational database referred to as the Technology Information Management System (TIMS).  Contracts have been awarded to design the new relational database, to design a user interface, build the database, and migrated the FMPro 6.0 data into FMPro 8.x.  The TTB now requires FMPro expertise to upgrade and enhance the database.
	
	Evolution of Requirements: A self-designed “unrelated” FMPro system had been used by TTB for the management and tracking of mission-related work since the early 1990s.  In the late 1990's TTB determined that the number of records and the needs of the office had outgrown the capabilities of the “unrelated” database system.  A relationally designed database  to most efficiently maintain the integrity of and standardize the entry of data, to track mission-related efforts and to produce accurate and cogent reports was developed and has been in use since November 2002.  TTB continues to enhance TIMS to meet the changing needs of NCI and TTB.  Those needs include new technology transfer requirements, specialized reporting to the Office of the Director, NCI, and changes in TTB procedures.		
	
Purpose and Objective:

The TTB is responsible for negotiating agreements between NCI scientist and private sector companies for the collaborative development of federally funded bio-medical research into commercially successful products.  The Main focus of these collaborative efforts is to produce commercial products that will improve the public health.  In addition, the TTB is also a Competitive Service Center (CSC) for technology transfer.  Under the CSC, the TTB negotiates agreements for 10 other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health.  One of the responsibilities of these collaborative agreements is to track the agreement negotiations from initial request to execution of the agreement, and through agreement expiration to final destruction of the physical file itself.  This process can span several years and involve many tracking dates.  TTB currently negotiates eight different types of agreements for the NIH. 
	
	The specific objectives of this procurement are to improve the current TIMS database with enhanced features such as security, searching, reporting, advertising, action items, etc. 
	
	Statement of Work:
	CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
	
	Specific Tasks to be Performed:  The contractor shall provide technical skills, insights and expertise on FMPro database development and implementation.

The contractor shall be a certified FileMaker Pro 8 developer.  Due to the complexity of the information that is tracked in the TIMS database, the many inter-relationships of the various agreements, and the need to obtain and integrate into TIMS data from other databases which are written in different programming languages, the contractor shall have at least 10 years FMPro experience in order to perform the work.   TTB shall provide all TTB mission-related information necessary to develop the database upon execution of contract.
	

	1.  	Add additional features to or improve features of the database from the list of projects below.

	13. 	Ability to set non-PHS/NIH contacts on Signatory List.  Currently the user can only designate PHS/NIH Contacts as “signatory”.  TTB needs this function to identify a non-PHS/NIH Contact as signatory so their name appears on an agreement signature block.
	
	14.  	Create and store or reference .pdf of agreement related documents 
	
	15.  	Have a feature added which asks User "is this final?" when printing letter/memo/internal document. This would eliminate the multiple Automatic Action Items when documents (Letters/Memos/Forms are printed multiple times before the User is satisfied.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60115-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-11.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Technology Transfers Branch (TTB) plans to enter into a IDIQ contract for a one year base period with four one-year option periods with an organization to enhance the current Technology Information Management System (TIMS) database with enhanced features and re-program TIMS to maximize the capabilities of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.  Base Year: Minimum 300 hours; Maximum 1,335 hours, for each of the four one-year option periods Minimum 100 hours; Maximum order 1,335 hours.

The North American Industry Classification code is 541511, and the business size standard is $21M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  
	General Description: The Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) of the Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) converted eight (8) individual and separate flat files of varying record size from FileMaker Pro (FMPro) version 4.1 into a FMPro 6.0 relational database referred to as the Technology Information Management System (TIMS).  Contracts have been awarded to design the new relational database, to design a user interface, build the database, and migrated the FMPro 6.0 data into FMPro 8.x.  The TTB now requires FMPro expertise to upgrade and enhance the database.
	
	Evolution of Requirements: A self-designed “unrelated” FMPro system had been used by TTB for the management and tracking of mission-related work since the early 1990s.  In the late 1990's TTB determined that the number of records and the needs of the office had outgrown the capabilities of the “unrelated” database system.  A relationally designed database  to most efficiently maintain the integrity of and standardize the entry of data, to track mission-related efforts and to produce accurate and cogent reports was developed and has been in use since November 2002.  TTB continues to enhance TIMS to meet the changing needs of NCI and TTB.  Those needs include new technology transfer requirements, specialized reporting to the Office of the Director, NCI, and changes in TTB procedures.		
	
Purpose and Objective:

The TTB is responsible for negotiating agreements between NCI scientist and private sector companies for the collaborative development of federally funded bio-medical research into commercially successful products.  The Main focus of these collaborative efforts is to produce commercial products that will improve the public health.  In addition, the TTB is also a Competitive Service Center (CSC) for technology transfer.  Under the CSC, the TTB negotiates agreements for 10 other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health.  One of the responsibilities of these collaborative agreements is to track the agreement negotiations from initial request to execution of the agreement, and through agreement expiration to final destruction of the physical file itself.  This process can span several years and involve many tracking dates.  TTB currently negotiates eight different types of agreements for the NIH. 
	
	The specific objectives of this procurement are to improve the current TIMS database with enhanced features such as security, searching, reporting, advertising, action items, etc. 
	
	Statement of Work:
	CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
	
	Specific Tasks to be Performed:  The contractor shall provide technical skills, insights and expertise on FMPro database development and implementation.

	10.  	Letters and Memos
	a)	Have the ability to save modified letters for specific agreements within the 				agreement record in TIMS. [As a PDF file would be best.

	14.  	Create and store or reference .pdf of agreement related documents 
	
	15.  	Have a feature added which asks User "is this final?" when printing letter/memo/internal document. This would eliminate the multiple Automatic Action Items when documents (Letters/Memos/Forms are printed multiple times before the User is satisfied.
	
	16.  	Incorporate QC into the TIMS fields:
•	“Specialist” is filled in.
•	Status and Date fields match

&#61607;	If status is ‘terminated’ then termination date is complete
&#61607;	If status is ‘withdrawn’ then withdrawn date is complete
•	For CRADAs make sure ‘Type’ is not empty
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then Abstract field is complete

Additional/clarifying information is provided as follows in response to questions received: 1. QUESTION:  Will installation and cable routing of any of the systems be required?  If so, will sketches or descriptions be available that show locations where various parts of the system are to be mounted? RESPONSE:  Installation and cabling is not required; this is to be a portable system. 2. QUESTION:  Will an acceptance test be peerformed on each system?  Will the contractor conduct the test or will the contractors role be as an observer and possibly provide technician support tot correct any problems? RESPONSE:  Each system will be tested within 30 days of delivery by the receiving unit.  If problems with the system(s) occur, system(s) will be returned to the contractor for repair/reeplacement.   3.  QUESTION:  Item 1g of the Specification requires ...exporting of digital images captured on the equipment with an internal CD burner  Is exporting accordplished by exporting the CD or is exporting over a LAN or other network  lso required?  RESPONSE:   Use of the CD is the minimum requirement. 4.  QUESTION: Given the limitations of storage on a CD vs. the Hard drive, it appears as if portions of the recorded data will be selected for CD burning.  Is there a requirement to record additional data on the hard drive and CD, such as tiime-date stamps , configuration settings, etc. that will facilitate the selection and also provide supplementarly information? RESPONSE:  The type of hard drive recording and marking should be identified for information selection and transfer to the CD.  Specific type of marking required has not been specified due to the various types available (i.e., date/time stamp / event numbe r).  The operator must be able to retrieve selected items from the hard drive and transfer them to a CD for future use and reference.  All information recorded on the CD must be retrievable using either the DOG system, or a standard PC running Windows 2000  or newer. 5.	QUESTION:  Is the DOG a brand name commercial product that you already have and want more of the units?  Or, is the DOG a generic term that you are using to describe the functionality you  are looking for vendors to supply? 	RESPONSE:  DOG is a generic term. 6.	QUESTION:  The purchase of 54 systems is pending the satisfactory completion of the first system.  Consequently, it isnt clear how this should be priced since there is only one Unit Cost to be inserted for the first 55 systems.  A price discount will b e given for the purchase of 55 but not for 1 system. RESPONSE:  55 is our estimate for each period; however, we may actually purchase more or less than 55 depending on our requirements.  SubCLINs may be added to provide discounts, i.e., 1 @ $______Each; 2-10 @ $______Each; 10-20 @ $______Each; and so on. Or you may discount CLINs by percentages, i.e., 1 @ $_______Each; 2-10 discounted 10%, etc. 7.	QUESTION:  Is it correct to assume that the illuminator(s) will be mounted on the same Pan/Tilt mechanism as the camera? RESPONSE:  Yes. 8.	QUESTION:  Is it acceptable to use one illuminator that can be programed to operate in either the flood or spot modes?  If 1 unit is used, can the requirement to provide two 100 foot power cables be changed to 1? RESPONSE.  Yes, but there is no requirement to provide 2 power cables, the (2) is a bullet comment marker for paragraph 2b(2). 9.	QUESTION:  For the 100 foot minimum distance for the flood light requirement, what is the angle of coverage? RESPONSE:  The coverage should at least match the capabilities of the camera.  If the cameras widest angle has a 15 degree, then 15 degrees is the minimum. 10.	QUESTION:  Would you clarify the meaning of the 1500 feet in 4b?  Is the Pan/Tilt motor operated from battery power? RESPONSE:  Each pan/tilt unit must draw its power and controlling signals from CAT5 cable length from the Monitor Control Center to the camera or camera with pan/tilt unit is 1500 feet using CAT5 cable.
