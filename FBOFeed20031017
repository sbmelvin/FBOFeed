<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure software license, annual support, and installation/training services on a sole source basis from Applimation Inc., New York, NY, for Applimation’s Db Downsizer, a monitoring tool providing agencies and companies with the capability to “downsize” the production database.  Db Downsizer is manufactured by Applimation and is available only through Applimation.
Db Downsizer reduces the storage allocation required for non-production databases through an automated two-step process. First, the data is filtered to allow the organization to determine the subset of  transactional data to be maintained. Then, the subset is extracted and the instance is programmatically rebuilt to reclaim any unused tablespace.
Applimation’s Db Downsizer product offers a process for both the initial subsetting of the data as well as the subsequent table space reclamation.  Db Downsizer is installed to a single “Applimation Home” repository providing the customer organization with the platform, repository and technology to support automated archiving and purging; continuous monitoring and reporting of changes to business rules and application code; and, automated monitoring and alerting for identified transactions and material events. The Applimation Home single repository platform and technology is unique to Applimation.  Applimation’s Db Downsizer has been fully certified by Oracle Corporation for Oracle Applications version 10.7, 11.0.3 and 11i. Applimation’s Db Downsizer employs a proprietary and unique methodology that is not based on or constrained by Oracle Applications’ purge routines.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Synopsis of an upcoming FDA solicitation. This is not a request for a formal proposal. 

This procurement will be a fixed-price, indefinite-quantity indefinite-delivery contract, with a base year plus four option years, for access to longitudinal patient-level electronic medical record (EMR) data.  The data shall provide a unique resource for the study of adverse reactions to prescription medications.  The objectives are to 1) provide direct access to longitudinal, population-based EMR data, including but not limited to the following types of information at a patient level: demographic, health history, diagnoses and procedures, laboratory test results, drug and biologic utilization and administration, and health encounters (e.g. hospitalizations, specialist visits, etc.); 2) provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet or network-based access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time; and 3) provide FDA personnel with the ability to download (or obtain by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.

The data shall meet the need of the FDA to access patient-level, longitudinal, EMR data.  The size and characteristics of the database population as well as a comparison of the database population to the larger geographic population from which it is derived shall be provided to the FDA, since these can affect the quality and usefulness of the data.  Characteristics of the database population shall minimally include the country of origin for the database population, number of people (active and inactive) in the database, extent of geographic diversity, demographics, size of special populations of interest (including children, women of childbearing age, and elderly patients); turnover rate, and enrollment data (if applicable) for participating individuals.  The electronic medical record shall include, but not be limited to, information concerning an individual’s health status, medical history, current medical conditions and health indicators (e.g. height, weight, blood pressure, smoking status), medications, allergies, vaccination and immunization history, visit history, and visits to other specialists or inpatient facilities.

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a six-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.  In addition, Offerors must be able to meet the following minimum mandatory requirements: verification of the commercial availability of the data resource as of June 1, 2003; verification that the database is in English, and includes English documentation and English-language-based training and technical support; verification that the database is accessible real-time via Internet or network-based methods, as of June 1, 2003; documentation that the database has a minimum of one million active patients as of June 1, 2003; confirmation that the Offeror shall provide training and a six-month trial subscription for two individuals, at no cost to the FDA, to the full, commercially available version of the database for the purposes of evaluation.  This trial subscription shall include direct access, documentation, and technical support for the entire trial subscription period; the Offeror shall provide FDA with a description of the process for downloading (or obtaining by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies; upon award, the Offeror shall agree to provide unlimited access to the data for FDA’s internal use without prior restraint, e.g., institutional review board (IRB) approval.  FDA acknowledges that any external release of results based on these data may be subject to mutually agreed-upon disclosure policies.

In addition, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the number of years of data available overall and in real time; the lag time between the health encounter date and online availability of the data; the mean, median, and range of observation time for patients in the database; the procedures for accessing data that are no longer online; the process for downloading datasets to be used for epidemiological investigations; and data collection and management procedures.  A complete data dictionary shall be included.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on October 15, 2003.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) wishes to announce the pending release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to provide course updates and enhancements and training course presentations over a 5-year period. This is strictly for your information, and may be altered in any way prior to the official release of the RFP shortly. Offerors are cautioned to use this only for planning purposes, and to read the actual RFP carefully when it is released.

At this time, the Government solicits your expression of interest/comments/suggestions regarding our desire to accomplish the work described below.

If you would be interested in submitting a proposal in the near future for this work, please fill out the Market Research form and send it to the Contracting Officer, Robert Prior, at either:

FAX: 202.366.3705    or      e-mail: bob.prior@fhwa.dot.gov

If you have comments or suggestions, please send them to the same address. We will consider your comments as we finalize our acquisition plan and the RFP document.

DRAFT SECTION C - STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1  CONTRACT OBJECTIVES

The objective of this contract is to accomplish, over a five-year period, the following for the 3.5-day Course #310109 - Federal-Aid 101 FHWA, and the 2-day Course #310110 - Federal-Aid 101 State:

1.	Revise both courses to:

a.	Reflect any minor required changes over the life of the contract 
b.	Reflect the changes required by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA) of 2003, Section 508 requirements, the criteria for International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) Continuing Education Units (CEUs). SAFETEA has no yet been authorized.
c.	Utililize asynchronous and/or synchronous distance learning

2.	Develop an Instructor’s Guide for each of the two courses
3.	Deliver approximately 2 sessions of both courses per month
4.	Develop a cadre of FHWA employees who eventually serve as primary FHWA instructors for the Federal-Aid 101 FHWA course.

During these times of economic expansion and growth, there are dramatic workforce changes taking place. The high demand for recent college graduates makes it increasingly difficult for the public sector to compete for these potential employees. The FHWA has traditionally hired recent college engineering graduates and developed them as generalists and technical specialists.

Given the increasing demand by our partners and customers for more technical assistance and the smaller pool of college graduates from which to select, the FHWA has been hiring more mid-career professionals. While their technical skills are excellent, their knowledge of the Federal-aid process is generally minimal.  This course was identified as one needed to train and orient new hires to the Federal-aid processes and regulations. Also, our State partners are experiencing the same hiring patterns and therefore need the same type of training. Specifically, the courses focus on:

·	General requirements and laws that govern the Federal-aid highway program;
·	Processes and procedures followed in the project development;
·	Identifying the unique partnership between the FHWA and our State Partners in administering the program; and,
·	Identifying flexibility inherent in the Federal-aid program.

C.2 LEARNING OUTCOMES

The training shall include a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, and group exercises/discussions. Future course development may include deliver of a portion or the entire course via distance learning. Adult learning principles are incorporated throughout the course and practiced in the delivery of the materials. Given the subject matter, it is anticipated that case studies and exercises will be transportation-related, highway-industry related and/or intermodal in scope.

NHI trains to Kirkpatrick’s level two (see “Evaluating Training Programs, the Four Levels”, Donald L. Kirkpatrick), which means that the participant acquires added skill and knowledge as a result of the training and this must be demonstrated in the classroom and confirmed by the instructor. The assessment must meet the IACET criteria for awarding CEUs.

Upon completion of the course the participants should be able to:

·	Identify the key elements of the overall project development process;
·	Identify the FHWA Civil Rights Act of 1964 Programs (i.e., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE), EEO Contract Compliance, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Indian Outreach- DOT Order 5301.1  DOT Programs, Policies and Procedures Affecting American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Tribes) and their relationship to the Federal-Aid Highway program and the Federal/State relationships (For information, go to www.gpo.gov and click “GPO Access” or go to www.fhwa.dot.gov.   Click “Legislation and Regulations”);
·	Integrate Environmental Justice into all aspects of project planning, development, and construction;
·	Develop a flowchart of the project development process from the initial planning concept through construction to open to traffic;
·	Identify Safety, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Operations, Research and Development’s roles in the Federal-aid process;
·	Identify ways that are used for public involvement early in the process;
·	Identify the fundamentals of several innovative financing techniques that will maximize the use of Federal-aid funds;
·	Develop a network of professionals that can be contacted for help; and,
·	Discuss how the Federal-aid laws and regulations relate to the other laws (i.e., National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Davis Bacon Act, OMB Circular A-87, 49 CFR part 18 (Common Rule).

C.3 DELINEATION OF CONTRACTOR TASKS

To achieve the contract objectives, the contractor shall perform at least the following tasks:

Item 1 - Course Revisions

Comments and recommendations for improvement of the course and/or course material can be expected throughout the life of this contract. It is anticipated that minor adjustments or revisions of the course material affecting specific technical data or information and “improved” images will be made by the contractor as part of the contractor’s normal preparation effort for course delivery at no additional cost to the Government. However, significant or more formal revisions may become necessary such as to: revise/add/delete course objectives and/or lesson learning objectives, reformat major sections of the course, update the material to add new technology, adjust the sequence of presentation, or otherwise improve the curriculum and reference materials associated with this course. If it is determined that such revisions are needed, the Contracting Officer will issue  a contract modification. 

The contractor shall revise the course to reflect the changes required by SAFETEA, Section 508 requirements and IACET criteria. The revisions shall be incorporated into the existing MS PowerPoint Slides, Participant’s Manual and into the Instructor’s Manual as it is developed. 

The contractor shall revise the course to incorporate distance-learning components that may be asynchronous and/or synchronous. The distance learning components shall be developed in compliance of the NHI Distance Learning Style Guide and Templates.

Item 2 - Instructor Guide Development

The contractor shall develop an Instructor’s Manual in compliance with the NHI Instructor-Led Courses Style Guide. The contractor shall provide to the COTR three draft copies of the Instructor’s Manual within the time established. Within 30 days after receipt of the Government’s comments, the contractor shall provide to the COTR one reproducible copy and one electronic copy of all final curriculum material.

Item 3 - Course Delivery

The contractor shall provide either one instructor to teach in conjunction with a Government instructor as directed by the COTR for Course 310109 - Federal Aid 101 FHWA or one instructor for the entire length of the course for Course 310110 – Federal Aid 101 State. 
 
Courses will not be scheduled at a rate of more than two per month without prior agreement by the contractor.  

Specifications for Course Presentations

A Federal, State, or local highway agency will usually host the courses. The host agency will furnish the training facility, the audio?visual equipment (except as noted below), and is responsible for selecting and inviting participants. The contractor shall provide a suitable laptop computer with projector for the course presentations. Approximately 30 participants will be invited to attend each course.  

For each course presentation, the contractor shall, as a minimum:

Conduct the presentation using the Section 508-compliant curriculum material developed and approved for this course. The Government is responsible to notify the contractor in advance of any special needs and accommodations of any disabled participants. However, at this time it is not known whether any participants will be disabled. Therefore, when contacting the host agency to determine the local conditions, the contractor shall ask whether any disabled people are among the course participants. If so, the contractor shall promptly notify the COTR so that FHWA or the hosting agency can provide for their reasonable accommodation (for example, a sign language interpreter), and the contractor shall conduct the presentation in a manner supportive of those accommodations.

Transport all training aids to the course location. This shall include all items to be used by the instructors such as overheads, slides, videotapes, etc. as well as materials used by each participant. 

Prepare and deliver to the COTR a Summary Report for the training course in response to number 3 above. The report shall briefly describe changes made to the course materials, major issues raised by participants during the period of performance, as well as recommendations from the contractor for revision and improvement to the course for future delivery.

Instructor Cadre Development

The contractor shall develop a cadre of FHWA employees who eventually serve as primary FHWA instructors for the Course 310109 Federal-Aid 101 FHWA. The development will be accomplished by having the FHWA instructors team-teach with a contract instructor to deliver Course # 310109. A single contract instructor delivers course # 310110.

C.4	 REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING SECTION 508 STANDARDS

It has been determined that some of the deliverables to be developed under this contract are subject to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998. The Section 508 requirements that apply to this contract are described below. Unless otherwise indicated, the contractor represents that all required 508 compliance requirements will be met.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Nordic Ammunition Company (NAMMO), Vanasverken AB, Box SE546 23, Karlsborg, Sweden  54623, the U.S. Marine Corps and USSCCOM requirement for the acquisition and qualification of non-development improvements to the existing 40mm M430 High Explosive, Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.  This procurement is conducted based on a Foreign Comparative Testing Proposal approval.  Improvements will include a propulsion system that eliminates the base plug design of the current cartridge and incorporation of programmable variable time fuze that allows the cartridge to function and fire from both the General Dynamic Armament Systems MK47 and MK19 Grenade Machine Gun.  The Product Improvement Program will consist of two self-destruct HEDP versions (point detonating and programmable).  The prime co ntractor will be fully responsible for integrating an improved Propulsion System, including the propellent, and the contractor developed Incendiary and Penetration Effects Warhead and Standard Fuze Interface Technology.  Upon successful completion of the integration efforts, approximately 5000 rounds will be procured for US Testing and Qualification.   The solicitation number is N00178-04-R-1014.  Note 22 applies. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren Laboratory Procurement Division has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area; therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/wwwDL/XD/SUPPLY.  DoD will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing  the CCR Web site at http://www.ccr.gov.  A paper registration form may be obtained from the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-888-227-2423.  Inquires on N00178-04-R-1014 may be directed to the attention of XDS105 at XDS11@nswc.navy.mil, phone 540-653-7478, or  Fax 540-653-7088.

The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center (DSC), 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Denver, Colorado, 80225, in support of the NPS Pacific West Region is seeking a qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide (A-E) General Engineering and supporting services (Architecture, Historic Architecture, and Landscape Architecture) under an Indefinite Quantity contract for a variety of projects within National Park Service units at locations throughout California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and islands of the outer Pacific. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330.  The Small Business Size Standard for this requirement is $4 million. TYPES OF PROJECTS:  Projects may include but are not limited to:  A. Buildings and Structures; B.  Drainage and Stormwater Management Systems; C.  Electrical Systems; D.  Environmental Engineering and Compliance Permitting; E.  Fire Protection Engineering; F.  Geotechnical Engineering; G.  Historic Structure; H.  Marine and Coastal Facilities; I.  Mechanical Systems;  J.  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Section 106 Compliance and Construction Permitting; K.  Seismic Engineering; L.  Site Development; M.  Transportation Engineering, Transportation Facilities, and Traffic Systems; N.  Surveying; O.  Water and Wastewater Systems and Facilities.  REQUIRED DISCIPLINES:  A.  Required disciplines include, but are not limited to, registered professional engineers in the following areas:  civil, electrical, environmental, fire protection, geotechnical, mechanical, sanitary, and structural engineers. Registration must be provided for all states and territories within the geographic coverage of the project. B. Additional disciplines which may be required for some projects include registered or certified professionals in the following areas:  Architecture, Historic Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Historic Landscape Architecture, Landscape History, Lighting, Acoustics, Seismic Engineering, Transportation and Traffic Engineering, Archeology, Anthropology, Architectural Conservations, Roofing, Surveying, Sustainable Technologies, Industrial Hygiene, Hazardous Materials, Cost Control and Cost Estimating, and Construction Management.  C.  Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, GIS, Microsoft Word processing, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.    PRIMARY SERVICES:  For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily:  A.  Project Planning and Compliance Services; B.  Pre-design Services including programming, site analysis, and supplementary services; C.  Design Services including schematic design, value analysis, design development, construction documents, and construction support; D.  Construction Management Services. COORDINATION:  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm(s) or in conjunction with subconsultants.  The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN: The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design, and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. EXECUTIVE ORDER: In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all Federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract. CONTRACT PERIOD:  All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract.  The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $5,000,000.00 for the life of the contract. Each task order will not exceed $500,000.00.  The $5,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: A.  Demonstrated ability and experience in the type of projects required under this contract, particularly small projects, in various climatic regions (i.e., high  mountain, heavy snow areas, arid deserts and coastal, urban and remote areas); and specific past performance records on previous architect-engineering work performed for Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets. B.  Demonstrated experience with integrated design, with an emphasis on coordinated multidisciplinary teams, establishment of up-front environmental goals, whole systems approach and follow-through.  Demonstrated records of the firm's ability to communicate, coordinate, facilitate, and work expeditiously with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns. C.  Demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in preparing designs for facilities that minimize the use of, and the environmental impact on, the earth's renewable and non-renewable resources (forest, grasslands, water, solar energy, wind energy, etc.) and to the earth's managed resources.  This includes, to the maximum extent practicable, specifying the use of recycled content material and recovered materials, and providing designs for construction that promote energy conservations, pollution prevention, waste reduction.  Emphasis will focus on familiarity with and project experience in applying principles of sustainability in various climatic regions (for example, high mountains, heavy snow areas, arid deserts, and permafrost) for the types of projects described and utilization of appropriate materials and construction techniques, with sensitivity to natural and cultural resources, as well as aesthetic considerations appropriate for National Park settings.  D.  Demonstrated professional qualifications of individuals listed to perform under the contract, including individual licenses, certifications, and experience in the work proposed.   E.  Ability and capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs. In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e. multiple awards).  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract.     SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS Eligible Small Business Administration certified 8(a)firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and completed Standard Forms 254 for each firm, a Team Standard Form 255, and an organization chart, all in an original only, i.e., no additional copies are required.

Croatia’s oil production has declined since the mid-1980s. The decline in production reflects a lack of additional reserve discoveries to replace the oil being produced.  In order to improve production from existing fields, INA has initiated additional 3D seismic and reentry drilling programs, which have improved production to some extent.  Water flood (secondary recovery) techniques are being employed throughout the INA system.

As an oil field is produced, the natural pressure of the oil reservoir gradually reduces as oil and gas are withdrawn.  As the pressure reduces, the oil movement through the various rocks and layers is slowed or stopped.  To compensate for this loss of “drive”, producers inject water to “drive” the oil from the rock and oil-bearing formations toward recovery wells where the oil and water (and natural gas) are removed and separated.  Depending on the characteristics of the oil and the oil-bearing formations, this “water drive” technique can be very effective.  Once a reservoir reaches the stage where water will no longer drive the oil, it is normally considered to be “depleted” and will be abandoned.  

However, if CO2 is injected into “depleted” water driven formations, it will usually combine with the oil in such a way that the oil becomes easier to “drive” through the formations.  Water can then be injected and the oil pushed toward recovery wells where the oil, water, gas and CO2 are recovered and separated.  The water is re-injected, the CO2 is recycled, the gas processed and the oil shipped to refineries for processing.  

In 1997, INA conducted a preliminary Feasibility Study in order to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR-CO2) recovery, which is considered a “tertiary oil recovery method.”    Based on this study, INA identified two fields, Ivanic and Zutica that are potential options and are close to each other.  In addition to being close to each other these fields are physically close to a large natural source of CO2.  INA estimates that these two fields could yield a total of 3.9 million metric tons (MT) beyond what could be expected through conventional water flooding techniques.  This would amount to recovery of 12% of the original oil in place.  If the initial project confirms the economics of EOR-CO2 the technology could greatly extend Croatia’s limited oil reserves.

The aim of the proposed Feasibility Study is to develop a new geological model to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of miscible and immiscible flood with carbon dioxide injection for enhanced oil recovery.  In addition, the Feasibility Study will include a review of the environmental benefits of the project.  The Feasibility Study will include a financial analysis presented in such a format as to satisfy INA’s internal requirements as well as those of major international finance institutions like the EBRD and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. 

Because of their proximity, both the Ivanic and the Zutica fields shall be assessed.  These fields will share common CO2 supply, oil, water, gas separation facilities, as well as CO2 recovery and recycling facilities.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $420,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., November 26, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the electrical, natural gas, water and wastewater infrastructure systems at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, New York. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, New York. System Descriptions: Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater. The station occupies approximately 985 acres on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant. The station has expanded several times and currently has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial type buildings). In addition, the station has Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing. The electrical distribution system is supplied power by Niagara-Mohawk Power Corporation by two separate feeds. The 914th Airlift Wing is supplied by a 13.2 kV electrical line that enters the base on the north side. The 107th Air Refueling wing is supplied by a 13.2 kV electrical supply line that enters the base on the west side. Each Air Wing has its own electrical distribution system, but they are connected by a switch that is locked in the open position. The electrical distribution system for the 914th portion of the base consists of approximately 24,400 feet of new overhead primary line and 2200 feet of overhead secondary line. The electrical distribution system for the 107th portion of the base consists of approximately 5,100 linear feet of underground primary line and 500 feet of underground secondary line. Pole mounted and pad mounted transformers of various sizes are used throughout the system. The electrical system supports approximately 130 outside area lights. The water distribution system is supplied by the City of Niagara Falls, New York. Water is distributed throughout the base in approximately 48,300 linear feet of cast iron, transite, and PVC water mains. Sizes range up to 10 inches in diameter. A pump station, located approximately one-quarter mile south of the southeast corner of the base boosts pressure. The water system also includes approximately 88 fire hydrants. The town of Wheatfield provides an emergency water source to the water system through a clay valve that releases if pressure in the base system drops to an unacceptable level. The natural gas distribution system is supplied by National Fuel Gas Company at two locations. Natural Gas for the 914th Air Wing is fed by a line that enters on the north side of the base. Natural gas for the 107th Air Refueling Wing is fed from the west side of the base. Approximately 25,000 feet of steel and plastic pipe make up the gas distribution system for the 914th Air Wing. Approximately 6,800 linear feet of steel and plastic line make up the natural gas distribution system. The wastewater collection system is discharged to the Niagara County Sewage District No.1 sewer system east of the base. The Niagara Falls wastewater collection system includes approximately 36,600 linear feet of pipe (ductile iron, reinforced concrete and PVC). Sizes range from 4 inch to 12 inch. The wastewater collection system is a combination of gravity flow and forced main and includes 3 pump stations.  See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list. A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Katharine Minker, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7155, Fax (301) 827-7151, Email kminker@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>This synopsis describes an upcoming solicitation that the FDA plans to issue.  A firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a base year plus two option years is planned.

The purpose of the contract resulting from the solicitation will be to assist the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Drug Safety (ODS) in expanding its access to medical error data resources, to complement our current adverse event databases.
 

This data will be used by FDA staff to better assess a medical error event, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  This effort is a response to the ongoing initiatives identified in the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force Report (QuIC response to the IOM report) dated February 2000.  The QuIC report, in part, charged FDA with the tasks of developing standards associated with proprietary drug name confusion, labeling and packaging to prevent dosing and drug mix-ups and medication errors; and, to strengthen FDA’s overall analytical capabilities.  To assist in performing these initiatives, ODS is interested in acquiring direct access to one centralized data system integrating multiple information systems from either US hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, or other components of health care systems representing potential and actual medical errors.  For the purpose of this requirement, medical errors include, but are not limited to, medication errors, laboratory errors, surgical errors, and/or device errors. 

The FDA intends to use Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data in addition to these data to strengthen our internal safety analysis on medical errors.  This analysis may lead to a regulatory action with a pharmaceutical or device company.  The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of critical issues associated with medical errors is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  The addition of these data would complement and strengthen the utility of the voluntary and mandatory reporting systems currently in place. Access to these data will increase FDA’s capability to perform regulatory impact studies to better understand and improve standards for medical product naming, labeling, packaging, and design.

Program Research Goals: 

Provide direct access to a medical error data resource with the capability of providing root cause and trend analysis.
Provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time.
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to retrieve reports that are driven by certain selection parameters (e.g. health system setting, product name, product specific information [strength, dosage form, etc.] date of error, type and cause of the error, and patient outcome). 
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to query and obtain aggregate reports for the purpose of conducting medical error evaluations.  
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to broadcast global safety messages to the health system users of the medical error database for the purpose of seeking reports for certain adverse events that have been previously identified by FDA (item is desirable but not required).

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a two-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.

The anticipated release date of the solicitation is the week of October 27, 2003.  Please do not call or email at this time. No further information regarding this requirement will be provided until after the solicitation is released.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT	--OFFICE MODERNIZATION
The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for professional Architect-Engineering (AE) services for a proposed office modernization project.  Construction cost for the project is currently estimated in the $300,000 to $500,000 range.

The proposed office modernization project may target several key LBNL buildings on its main site or in local off-site leased space.  The proposed project will yield an office configuration that increases occupancy density; improves quality; and provides greater occupant interaction, collaboration, and satisfaction.  The proposed project will concentrate first on large blocks of space (approximately 7,000 gsf per block) containing mainly administrative functions.

The project includes conceptual design of alternative layouts; reduction in the number of enclosed offices and individual cubicles; consolidation of file rooms, copy rooms, and other shared space; and provision for common gathering areas, e.g. coffee bars, conversation areas, etc.

<RESPDATE>112103
<ARCHDATE>12212003
<CONTACT>Ms. Annie Wang 301-227-5163
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) seeks sources within industry for chemical processes/systems to de-mulsify oil-in-water emulsions consisting of bilge water and chemical surfactants, e.g. bilge cleaners and detergents, aboard U.S. Navy ships both underway and in port.  We are also interested in additives that promote coalescence of oil droplets smaller than 20 microns to form larger oil droplets that are more easily separated by the shipboard parallel-plate oil/water separator. The process/system shall exhibit, as a minimum, the following characteristics: (1) ability to treat or break chemically stabilized oil-in-water emulsions, consisting of oil droplet sizes 20 micron and smaller. The bilge water oil content varies between 15 ppm and 10,000 ppm (usually no more than 1,000 ppm); (2) ability to perform in the presence of dissolved solids, suspended s olids, a pH range of 3 to 9, and small quantities of a wide variety of solvents; and (3) ability to process the emulsified oily bilge water at flow rates of 5 to 25 gallons per minute for continuous processes or a minimum of 300 gallons per hour for batch processes. Continuous processes/systems are preferable but batch processes/systems may be acceptable if they do not impact the ship significantly in terms of additional space or weight requirements.  Space availability is very limited in oily waste processing areas. The following information must be provided: flow rate range for continuous treatment systems; batch size and processing time for batch treatment systems; required processing equipment including pumps, tanks, mixing equipment, pre-treatment equipment; total and component sizes and weights (dry and wet) of all processing equipment; data demonstrating the recommended  additives and related equipment facilitate de-emulsification of chemically stabilized oily wastes and the subsequent separation of demulsified oil and sludge from water; control requirements for  chemical addition;  safety requirements (including MSDS) and consumption rate of chemical additives; disposal requirements for waste/sludge generated; estimated  size range of the emulsified oil droplets that can be treated successfully; normal operating and maximum permissible temperatures and pressures; overall physical dimensions;  power requirements; additional utilities requirements, e.g.  potable water, compressed air; maintenance requirements; Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF);  labor requirements for operation and maintenance; current application(s) of the process/system;  expected performance, i.e. efficiency of de-emulsification and oil/water separation; and system cost in qu antities of 1, 10 and 100 units.  A summary of agents or contaminants that could potentially interfere with the operation and performance of de-emulsification treatment is also required. Responses to this synopsis are requested within 21 days from the date of publication.  This synopsis is for information purposes only to identify potential suppliers.  It does not constitute an RFP and does not obligate the Government in any way to purchase any of the systems offered.  Responses to this synopsis shall be sent to: Commander, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, 9500 Mac Arthur Boulevard, West Bethesda, MD 20817-5700, Attn: A.Wang, Code 634. Questions regarding this memorandum should be directed to Annie Wang at (301) 227-5163.

<SUBJECT>CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SUPPORT TO THE ATTACK AND LAUNCH EARLY REPORTING TO THEATER (ALERT) CENTRAL THEATER PROCESSING PROGRAM (CTPP)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-17
<RESPDATE>040501
<CONTACT>Arlene Dudley, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 363-5671, Email arlene.dudley@losangeles.af.mil - Roslyn Austin-Stewart, Contract Specialist, Phone (310)363-5500, Email Roslyn.Austin-Stewart@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>Provide continued operations and maintenance support to the Attack and Launch Early Reporting to Theater (ALERT) Central Theater Processing Program (CTPP) system until the Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) High, Increment 1, Mission Control System (MCS) reaches Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and has demonstrated stability and maturity.  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) requires a bridge between the ALERT system and SBIRS High, Increment 1, to ensure uninterrupted operational capability. The ALERT system is the operational processing segment of the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system.  This acquisition will provide a continuation of non-personal, technical service to ensure proper operations and maintenance support to the Defense Support Program ALERT program.  Aerojet Electronics Systems has supplied this support since contract inception in 1995. The system has a 7-day per week, 24 hour per day operational requirement.  This acquisition will extend the support to provide continued hardware and software maintenance support.  The ALERT system will require the continued operations and maintenance (O&M) function to continue unimpeded for at least 6 months after SBIRS High IOC, Increment 1, or until adequate system operation and function have been established.  To compete such a highly specialized service would result in unacceptable duplication of cost.  If competed, the reproduction and acquisition of data, telemetry information, computers, facilities, a special compartmented information facility, communication lines, and antennas, would result in unacceptable costs for such a limited period of performance.  Estimates of such an effort based on industry data suggest a cost of approximately $20M.  Any contractor assuming responsibility for the ALERT system on 1 October 2001 must be fully trained and prepared to sustain the systems on the first day.  There will be no transition period.  The contract is Cost Plus Award Fee.  The proposed basic effort will commence 01 October 2001 and continue through 30 September 2002.   There will also be an additional effort for the required deactivation of the ALERT system.   Exercise of the options will be subject to availability of funds and SBIRS High, Increment 1, demonstrated performance.  There is an AFSPC requirement for parallel operation of the ALERT system with the SBIRS MCS for at least 6 months after the IOC.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  For planning purposes, an RFP may be released on or about 05 March 2001, with an estimated contract award date on or about 01 September 2001.  The Government will not recognize any cost associated with the submission of a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Thus, potential bidders should note that all options may or may not be exercised.  The level of effort required to support mission success has been defined.  The acquisition will include the same level of effort as the current CTPP contract effort O&M activities.  The letter regarding concurrent fact finding will be released approximately 30 days from the date of this notice.  Potential bidders should respond with a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) no later than 05 April 2001.  Total page count of the SOC should not exceed 50 pages.  The Government will notify contractors submitting a SOC of their status.  In the event that no other potential offerors respond, the Government intends to award to the incumbent contractor.   All written responses shall be submitted to SMC/MTKD, 185 Discoverer Blvd., Suite 2512, El Segundo, CA 90245-4695, Attn: Ms Arlene Dudley, Contracting Officer.  Paper copies of CTPP requirement documents are available.  Documents are accessible by contacting the program office technical point of contact.  All visitor clearances should be faxed to the Visitor Control Center at (310) 363-6882. Visitor requests should specify Attn: Tommy Le, Technical Document Library.  Since access to classified and critical technologies will be required for this effort, we expect that foreign contractors will be authorized only for non-restricted portions of the acquisition.  Direct technical questions to Mr Vincent Perez, (310) 363-1049 (Vincent.Perez@losangeles.af.mil), and contractual questions to Ms Arlene Dudley.  All future announcements, updates, and unclassified information for this program will be available on the SBIRS Program Office home page of the World Wide Web (http://www.laafb.af.mil/SMC/MT/Sbirs.htm). This process is subject to change. Note 26

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS ISSUED FOR INFORMATIONAL AND DEMO PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The Air Force Communications Agency (AFCA) has built a training and exercise simulator network that allows the network crew forces to experience and practice network operations and network defense in a risk free environment.  AFCA is now conducting market research and requesting information from industry for a Network Traffic Generator (NTG).  AFCA is looking for vendors who are willing to demonstrate, at no cost to the government, their commercial capability in providing NTG.  The following NTG requirements are to enhance the training/exercise environment, simulating the appearance of a real large network:  The console interface must not place any restrictions upon device location, either geographical or network based, other than a requirement for TCP/IP connectivity between the Network Traffic Generator (NTG) device and the cluster controller system.  Must be no greater than 6RU and 19-inch rack mountable system.  Capable of providing a virtual router capability.  The virtual router will be software configurable for class A, B or C networks within the NTG.  The virtual router will provide the device or network under test with a next hop router, which the device or network under test can forward traffic to.  The NTG must then be capable of generating traffic from any possible IP subnet to include private IP address space, (such as the 10.0.0.0 network), and forwarding them to the device under tests such that they appear to be forwarded by a router on the local network of the device under test.  The NTG must be capable of generating traffic using multiple (3 or more) IP subnets on a single port.  The NTG must be capable of utilizing non-contiguous subnets, and subnets of varying sizes on a single port.  Provides the ability for the trainer to build upon the virtual network to emulate actions (stateful traffic) coming from end users on the virtual network.  Must be able to generate IP, TCP, and UDP traffic over multiple ports.  Generates random and static IP and MAC addresses with easy to use configuration interface.  Generates stateful network traffic at 80 % of wire speed (100MB).  Generates random network traffic data packet sizes.  Generates protocol/service traffic types in a random pattern.  Throttle bandwidth utilization.  Throttle protocol/service utilization.  Capable of creating complete HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, DNS, and Telnet sessions/connections able to interact with stateful third party systems, such as servers, firewalls, email gateways, virus scanners, spam filters, application layer gateways, etc.  Supports a minimum of 500 servers per port.  The NTG must be capable of supporting any mix protocols/services per port with application compatibility to third party devices such as application layer gateways/firewalls and email forwarding systems.  The NTG must be capable of supporting multiple protocols on a single port utilizing the same IP address.  Trainer can control / maintain up to 100 simultaneous attacks.  Attacks must be manageable from a central location and provide synchronized activities including  start/stop and configuration capabilities.  The NTG must be capable of generating distributed denial of service traffic, such as SYN Floods, ARP Floods, TCP and UDP port scans, PING Floods, etc.  The NTG must be capable of generating the DDoS on the same ports that are generating multi-protocol, stateful, application compatible TCP traffic.  The NTG must permit the user to develop custom DDoS attacks using a well-defined, documented scripting language.  The NTG must provide full control of every single bit in the Ethernet frame for custom DDoS attacks. The NTG must automatically add any custom developed DDoS attacks to the NTG GUI for inclusion in test configurations.  The NTG must be capable of generating traffic, which simulates application layer attacks over HTTP, such as Code Red and Nimda.  The NTG must be capable of passing these simulated attacks to third party HTTP servers using properly established TCP connections.

Interested contractors are requested to provide their commercial capability statements (not to exceed 10 pages), and their estimated cost to the Contracting Officer, AMC CONF/LGCFC.  Contractors responding to this request for information may be requested to provide at no cost to the Government, a demonstration of their system capabilities during the Dec 2003 timeframe.  The demonstration will support market research activities to prove the availability of commercial solutions to potentially fulfill AFCA's unique requirements.  Additional details regarding any demonstrations will be provided to those vendors submitting positive capability statements, and interested in performing the demonstration at no cost to the Government.  
All packages submitted in response to this Request for Information (RFI) should include the following information:  Name and address of company, business size, company point of contact, telephone number, fax number, E-mail address, and statement of capability.  The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete and submitted to the contracting office electronically via e-mail no later than 3:00 p.m. C.S.T. October 31, 2003.  POINT OF CONTACT: AMC CONF/LGCFC, Terri Francoeur, Contract Specialist, Phone (618) 256-9950, Fax (618) 256-3091, E-mail teresa.francoeur@scott.af.mil or Nancy Jurke, Contracting Officer, Phone (618) 256-9963, Fax (618) 256-3091 or nancy.jurke@scott.af.mil

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of intent to sole source to the Dupuy Institute.
<DESC>GovWorks on behalf of the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) intends on awarding a sole source contract to The DuPuy Institute (TDI).  CAA is acquiring services in the form of a three phase project entitled, "The Development of the Chinese Army During Recent Chinese Conflicts", to collect and analyze Soviet/Russian historical research on modern Chinese conflicts.  The primary area of research and interest is Chinese doctrine, strategy, tactics, and combat operations for each conflict.  Case studies will include:  Chinese Communist-Koumintang Civil War 1927-37, participation in the Sino-Japanese War 1937-45, the Chinese Civil War 1945-49, the Occupation of Hainan Island 1950, the Korean War 1950-53, the Occupation of Tibet 1950-51, the various conflicts in the Taiwan Straits (including the incidents in 1950,1954-55, 1958, 1960, 1962, and 1965), and various revolts and unrest in Tibet (including 1954, 1956, 1959, 1960).  The Chinese army has changed and undergone an extensive modernization, thus more recent conflicts such as participation in the Vietnam War 1963-65, border clashes with India 1959 and 1962, Nepal 1960, the Soviet Union 1969, the Battle of the Parcel Islands 1974, and the border war with Vietnam 1979.  The first phase will focus on Sino-Soviet Border Conflict examining Chinese Operational Art with/from the Soviet perspective.  The DuPuy Institute is a Non-Profit institution and the only known provider of scholarly research and objective analysis of historical data related to armed conflict and the resolution of armed conflict.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  
The products under consideration are: GOJO/SKILCRAFT Hair & Body Shampoo (8520-00-NIB-0028, 800 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0029, 2000 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0066, 1000 mL), GOJO/SKILCRAFT Lotion Hand Soap (8520-00-NIB-0012, 12 oz.; 8520-00-NIB-0024, 800 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0025, 2000 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0065, 1000 mL), GOJO/SKILCRAFT Natural Orange Hand Cleaner with Pumice (8520-00-NIB-0069, .5 Gal; 8520-00-NIB-0070, 1 Gal), MICRELL/SKILCRAFT Antibacterial Hand Soap (	8520-00-NIB-0010, 800 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0027, 2000 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0067, 1000 mL),  PURELL/SKILCRAFT Instant Hand Sanitizer (8520-00-NIB-0008, 800 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0017, 2 oz.; 8520-00-NIB-0058, 1000 mL), PURELL/SKILCRAFT Instant Hand Sanitizer with Aloe (8520-00-NIB-0060, 4.25 oz.; 8520-00-NIB-0061, 12 oz.; 8520-00-NIB-0062, 800 mL; 8520-00-NIB-0063, 1000 mL), GOJO/SKILCRAFT Wall Dispenser (4510-00-NIB-0001, 800 mL; 4510-00-NIB-0002, 2000 mL; 4510-00-NIB-0003, 1000 mL; 4510-00-NIB-0007, 1000 mL; 4510-00-NIB-0008, 800 mL; 4510-00-NIB-0009, 2000 mL), PURELL/SKILCRAFT Wall Dispenser (4510-00-NIB-0005, 1000 mL; 4510-00-NIB-0006, 1000 mL).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT NATIONAL SECURITY AND HOMELAND SECURITY MISSION PRIORITIES

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering expertise, capabilities, and technology to conduct collaborative research and development work with industrial partners to support National Security and Homeland Security mission priorities.

The Chemical and Biological National Security Program (CBNP) at LLNL conducts research and development for biological and chemical agent detection, and radiation and nuclear detection for National Security applications. CBNP has expertise and capabilities in the areas of basic science, technology, integrated systems, as well in mitigation and remediation. For additional information about CBNP, please visit their website at http://www.llnl.gov/hso/chembioprog.html.

The CBNP is now seeking industrial partners for collaborations in the development, deployment and commercialization of technology for biological and chemical agent detection, and radiation and nuclear detection. For example, one such technology is an autonomous pathogen detection system (APDS) for rapid, continuous monitoring of multiple airborne biological threat agents in the environment.  The APDS is completely automated, offering aerosol sampling, in-line sample preparation fluidics, multiplex flow cytometer detection and identification assays, and orthogonal, flow-through PCR (nucleic acid) amplification and detection. The APDS has several key advantages: (1) ability to measure up to 100 different agents and controls in a single sample; (2) flexibility and ease with which new bead-based assays can be developed and integrated into the system; (3) extremely low false positive and false negative detection due to the presence of two orthogonal detection methods; (4) ability to use the same basic system components for multiple deployment architectures; and (5) relatively low cost per assay and minimal consumables.  APDS is just one example of LLNL technologies available for biological and chemical agent detection. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in working with CBNP should have specific projects and opportunities for joint research and development work to support National Security and Homeland Security mission priorities. Companies should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to developing and commercializing biological and chemical agent detection technology.
4.	A description of specific projects and opportunities for joint research and development work with CBNP.

 
Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 58-04.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest.

The FTS2001 contracts that provide agencies long distance, data and other important services will expire in the 2006-2007 timeframe.  In collaboration with the Interagency Management Council (IMC), which represents the federal agencies user community, FTS is developing a comprehensive follow-on acquisition program, called FTS Networx.  FTS Networx will replace the FTS2001 contracts, provide services currently offered on other FTS contracts and include new services.

In order to initiate communication with industry on this program, GSA FTS is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to: (1) provide information to potential industry offerors regarding the FTS Networx Program; and (2) solicit comments from industry on the Government’s strategy and industry’s ability to meet the Government requirements.  The RFI consists of a main body which describes the acquisition strategy and high level government requirements.  Two additional attachments provide descriptions of the services to be acquired and the billing data requirements.  The RFI specifies instructions for responding.  The RFI is posted with this synopsis and provides more complete information.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE	:	o/a March 15, 2004 ¡V March 14, 2006
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE	:	Manila, Philippines
JOB DESCRIPTION	:

A.	BACKGROUND

USAID/Philippines has recently received USAID/Washington approval for a new Strategic Objective (SO) for education for 2004-2009.  The new SO was approved as an addition to the current Mission strategy for 1999-2004, but will be carried into a new strategy being developed for 2005-2009.  (Information on the current strategy can be obtained from the website http://www.usaid-ph.gov)  Relative to the current strategy, ongoing discussions for developing the new strategy indicate that the new strategy most likely will refine and update three existing SOs on economic governance, family planning and health, and environment and energy, expand the Mindanao conflict SO to cover other conflict-affected areas, and continue implementation of the recently approved SO for education.

The Philippines education system was once one of the best in all of Asia.  However, the system has deteriorated drastically over the last generation in both quality and access.  Key comparative advantages are eroding.  President Arroyo and education analysts have raised concern about the decline in English language competency and general academic performance among Philippines graduates.  It has also been noted that English language competency is directly related to the economic health of the nation as many Filipinos work overseas and provide remittances.  There is also recognition of the need for teacher training in all subject matter with particular emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT).  The President, to address the decline in educational performance, has required that Math and Science return to English as the language of instruction.  

The situation is most acute in Mindanao and within the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in particular.  The ARMM remains the poorest area of the Philippines and has correspondingly low social indicators.  The quality of education is typically poor and, according to reliable information, a certain proportion of Islamic teachers are adherents of Wahabi Islam and impart messages to their students that are consistent with the appeals of terrorist groups.

Improved access to quality education is widely seen by the Filipino people as a means to a better life.  It can play an important role in helping Muslim Filipinos become more effective players in the country¡¦s pluralistic and democratic state.  Increased access to education will help address alienation of the Muslim population, and help them see a better future as part of the Philippine state.  Improved education will help level the playing field and reduce marginalization of this population to enable them to compete for employment opportunities and participate more fully in economic growth.  

USAID/Philippines new education program intends to improve access to, and the quality of, education. Efforts will focus particularly on reducing the differences between education opportunities in Mindanao, especially the ARMM and other conflict-affected areas, and the rest of the nation.  This will include helping to prepare the next generation of Muslim leaders, professionals and decision-makers, and which will require higher education training as well.  The program also will address the special problems of out-of-work youth in the conflict-affected areas. It will help address systemic weaknesses, including corruption in the provision of goods and services.  Activities will include: (1) expanding and improving community-based learning activities in both formal and non-formal education sectors; (2) enhancing capacity for teaching Math, Science and English; (3) improving education sector policies at the local and national levels; and (4) reintegrating out-of-school youth in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.  USAID/Philippines will implement this program through local partners in collaboration with a U.S. Government (USG) interagency working group including the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Service (PAS) and the Peace Corps (PC), and other donors.  USAID will also encourage U.S. and Philippine private sector groups involved in education through corporate social responsibility programs to play an important role by engaging in productive partnerships. USAID will also incorporate other efforts already underway.   

Under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao - 2 Program (GEM-2), USAID/Philippines has started activities in education in the ARMM that are already producing encouraging results.  The supported programs aim to (a) increase community awareness of major education problems in the ARMM; (b) help various groups (i.e., parents¡¦ groups, business organizations) improve schools; (c) build the educational planning and analysis capacity of the ARMM Department of Education; (d) improve the English language skills of both school children and the general public; (e) increase computer literacy and internet access in selected schools; and (f) provide selected interventions in key vocational institutions.  GEM-2 is also supporting an internship program for some 15-20 recent graduates of ARMM colleges and universities who will spend some 4-6 months each working as interns in the Philippines House of Representatives.  The Program aims to help the interns develop a greater understanding of the role of Congress in shaping the economic development of the Philippines, and thus play a key role in USAID¡¦s attempts to improve both governance and education in the ARMM.  The new education SO will incorporate these promising activities into the new programs, including possibly replicating successful interventions in other conflict-affected and/or disadvantaged areas of the Philippines.    

As part of the Education SO, USAID/Philippines also recently signed an agreement with the Peace Corps for a Pilot Education Assistance Program. The Program, which will benefit the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao, is designed to enhance the capacity of Mindanao¡¦s public school teachers, instructional staff and student teachers.  The program will provide training for them in English education, Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) and content-based instruction methodologies and techniques in Math, Science, Health and Environment to enhance their lesson-planning and classroom skills.  

Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, creativity and innovation, discussions and negotiations with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), the ARMM government, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID¡¦s newer substantive involvement in this sector.  The emphasis on public-private sector partnerships also requires significant similar engagement with local and international corporate philanthropic organizations, and NGOs.

<SUBJECT>D -- CATALOGER''S DESKTOP ON THE WEB
<SOLNBR>RFQ3916
<RESPDATE>082903
<CONTACT>Valda Murfree-Fleming, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-707-0468, Fax 202-707-8611, Email vmur@loc.gov
<DESC>Cataloger's Desktop on the Web
		
1.  Background
The Library of Congress (LOC) Cataloging Distribution Service (CDS) is required to convert its quarterly CD-ROM-based cataloging documentation product, Cataloger's Desktop, to online access via the World Wide Web. Cataloger's Desktop provides access to a large number of electronic manuals and procedural documentation that describe standards for performing cataloging and classification tasks in a library. The product is used by staff at LOC as well as by many library professionals and para-professionals worldwide. LOC staff is located in three buildings on Capitol Hill. A very small number of LOC staff are located at remote sites: Taylor St. (Washington, D.C.) and six Overseas Field Offices. Additionally, this product has users in the library field nationally and internationally. 
2.  Scope
The Contractor shall develop a web-based delivery system for Cataloger's Desktop using NextPageJ LivePublish. The system must be updatable on a quarterly basis. The web application must use the current Cataloger's Desktop CD-ROM product as a beginning point for interface and functionality design.  The Contractor is encouraged  to enhance Cataloger's Desktop for web delivery. The web-based application must be capable to accept updates by CDS staff.  The accompanying customer management system must have the ability to be administered by the CDS staff. The deliverable shall become the property of LOC.  It shall also be accessible to LOC staff, and national and international users. 
3.  General Requirements
3.1 	Components of Cataloger's Desktop on the web
The Contractor shall create Cataloger=s Desktop on the web as two components: an information delivery system based on the latest release of NextPageJ LivePublish; and a customer management system that enables CDS staff to manage subscription- and access-information for individual subscribers of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. The latter will include a customer interface that enables subscribers to click through and accept a license, as well as update customer records for changes in email addresses, local system administrators, or customer-specific configuration issues. The final product must comply with Section 508 to assure web accessibility.

3.2.	Design Prototypes
The Contractor shall prepare in consultation with CDS a maximum of three design prototypes for the overall look and feel of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. Each prototype will include at least one query template. CDS will evaluate and select the preferred design. 
	3.3	Target Audience
The targeted audience is library staff working in cataloging areas. It is projected that Cataloger=s Desktop on the web will be used by approximately 5,000 librarians at roughly 1,000 institutions. 400 users will be LOC staff while approximately 4,600 users will be subscribers who have purchased Cataloger=s Desktop from CDS. The job position, educational level, and computer experience of prospective users can vary tremendously. Professional library staff may have a masters degree in library science while library technicians may have high school diplomas. Although the targeted user community is international, the Contractor will not be required to design Cataloger=s Desktop on the web for every type of end-user computer platform. The language of the product shall be English. 
3.4	Estimated hours
It is estimated that the Contractor shall be able to accomplish the tasks in approximately 400 work hours, by working approximately 6-8 hours per week, at the Library of Congress. It is anticipated that in addition to the hours spent by the Contractor, LOC staff will contribute approximately 600 hours of work to the project. Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be ready for launched within 6 months of contract award.
4.  Hardware/software Requirements
4.1	Software
The Library of Congress has selected FolioViews 4.4 (AFolio@) as the standard tool for creating and maintaining the source files for Cataloger=s Desktop. The files shall be received by CDS as WordPerfect 8.0+ or MS Word files and converted and content-enriched by CDS staff to Folio Infobase format (NFO) using the current release of FolioViews. LOC's long-term goal is to migrate the content-enriched infobases to XML when suitable web delivery applications become available. In the meantime, LOC has selected the current release of LivePublish from NextPageJ to deliver Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. The Contractor-developed LivePublish application must have the ability to accept FolioViews 4.x infobase files in native format. If file processing is required to incorporate infobases in the LivePublish day one product or quarterly updating, the Contractor shall develop this processing software. Such processing software must be structured so that it can be run by LOC staff in a production environment and must  not be more complex than the current release of FolioViews Workbench. 
4.2	Platform
The minimum platform for LOC staff and CDS customers of Cataloger=s Desktop is as follows:
$	Netscape 4.78, 128 bit encryption; or
$	Internet Explorer 5.5 (Javascript enabled)
4.3	Customer Management System
The Contractor must provide a customer management system that will enable CDS staff to manage subscription- and access-information for individual customers of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. Subscription duration and numbers of simultaneous users per subscription must be administered solely by CDS staff. This customer management system must also enable customers to click-through and accept a license, as well as update their customer record for changes in email addresses, local system administrators, or customer-specific configuration issues. 
4.4	Server 
The Contractor shall recommend the location of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web and its customer management system. If Cataloger=s Desktop on the web is located on either the Contractor=s or a third party=s server, CDS will purchase a product-specific domain name.  That name will be used for the product. If Cataloger=s Desktop on the web resides on an LOC server, the product will have a sub-domain of  the LOC web domain (such as http://desktop.loc.gov). 
The ITS technical staff will be available to provide guidance to the Contractor on all server requirements.
5.  Specific Requirements
5.1	Project Plan
			The project plan created by the Contractor shall lay out a well-defined project schedule steps, deliverables, intermediate tasks, that describes development milestones, and resources. It shall focus on the responsibilities assigned to the Contractor, which will incorporate advice on content, CDS=s responsibility, where necessary. It must be delivered to LOC within eight (8) workdays from the date of contract award. 	

5.2 	CD-ROM Product Description
Appendix A: Cataloger=s Desktop on CD-ROM Product Description focuses on the existing CD-ROM product available in FolioViews 4.4 infobase format. The Contractor will examine the content to determine the need to be re-purposed for presentation on the web. 
C	Recommendations for the conversion of the existing content for web delivery.
C	Suggestions on methods and techniques for adding enhanced access and functionality to the web-based product.
5.3	Design Document
The design document shall provide the overall design for Cataloger=s Desktop on the web developed from this statement of work. It shall include the following:
C	Three (3) design prototypes; these prototypes will include the user interface and representative functionality and must include at least 1 query template; these prototypes are the property of CDS
C	CDS evaluates the prototypes and selects one. The selected prototype will then be used as the basis for Cataloger=s Desktop on the web.
5.4	Cataloger=s Desktop on the web - Specific Requirements
Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be developed using the latest release of NextPageJ LivePublish. The product must be designed with end-user usability as central to its design approach. Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be updatable by CDS staff on at least a quarterly basis. This updating must be accomplished by either the direct loading of Folio infobase files, or by washing Folio infobase files through a simple production software routine. The Cataloger=s Desktop on the web design must also be modular so that additional files can be added easily for new releases of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web when necessary. 
The LivePublish-based information system must not employ proprietary plug-ins or extensions that may not be supportable in subsequent releases of LivePublish unless waived by the Library. If waived by the Library, Contractor must explain steps taken to ensure no compatibility, security or upgrade issues will result.
Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be fully viewable by all major browsers, specifically Netscape 4.78 or higher, and Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher. 
The Cataloger=s Desktop product has quarterly updates to keep the standard documents and manuals it contains current. The structure of the product is stable and its appearance does not change dramatically very often. However, we must be able to update Cataloger=s Desktop on the web as needed (at least quarterly) to incorporate any changes to the product. 
The Cataloger=s Desktop on the web delivery package shall include: 
3.	User interface designed with optimal usability as its focal-point.
4.	Software to convert Folio infobase files to be compatible with LivePublish without losing their native content enrichment.  This conversion software must be structured so that it can be run by LOC staff in a production environment and must be no more complex to run than the current release of FolioViews Workbench. 
5.	The latest release of NextPageJ LivePublish development and server software.
6.	Creation of a pilot version of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web for Ahands-on@ testing inside and outside of LOC. The Apilot version@ of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web is a segment of the product that contains all the technical capabilities used in the entire product.
