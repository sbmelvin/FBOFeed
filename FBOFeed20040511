<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and  to enter into a contract with Chelan County Conservation District, 301 Yakima Street, Wenatchee WA 98801.  Reclamation recently contracted with Chelan County Conservation District (CCCD) to produce an IFIM report for the Entiat and Mad Rivers.  Reclamation's activities under RPA 149 regarding water purchases and leasing rely on the information in this report. The instream flow recommendations in the IFIM study are indexed to two continuous recording telemetered gages on the mainstem Entiat River, Entiat near Entiat @ RM1.4 and Entiat near Ardenvoir @ RM18, and one continuous recording gage on the Mad River, Mad at Ardenvoir.  Thus, continued operation of these gages is essential for Reclamation to be able to administer its water rights purchase and leasing program under RPA 149. The CCCD has helped fund the operation of USGS Gages in the Entiat subbasin since 1996, and currently is under contract with USGS to fund their maintenance. The CCCD requires cost sharing to meet these obligations.  The amount of Reclamation's cost share being requested is only 36% of the total cost for maintaining the gages. Only the proposed contractor possesses the following unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition: CCCD is the only contractor able to provide the data required.  CCCD is the entity which holds the contract with USGS to have this work performed.  In addition, Reclamation is only funding approximately 36% of the total cost for maintaining these gages, the majority of which is determined by USGS and not negotiable. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received within 7 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>RADIATION DOSE ESTIMATES FROM
PLUTONIUM INTAKES

1.	OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the proposed work is to develop dose assessment methods and computational tools based on recently available toxicological information on plutonium and to estimate the organ doses for use in epidemiologic studies. 
The purpose this work is to provide support to epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to plutonium by inhalation, ingestion, or open wounds by: (1) estimating radiation organ doses from plutonium; and (2) quantifying uncertainties in dose estimates. 
The computational tools consist of computer software that allows the user to derive the intake of plutonium based on bioassay data (e.g., measured urine or fecal excretion rate), and then, by working from the intake forward, to reconstruct organ doses using contemporary biokinetic and dosimetric models.  The computer software will provide the capability of individual and batch (cohort) analysis, resulting in annual and committed organ doses with uncertainties.

 

 
Updates of the current ICRP plutonium systemic model are already emerging by analysis of data coming from two recent plutonium injection studies (the Harwell study; Talbot et al. 1993, 1997; Newton et al. 1998 and the NRPB study; Popplewell et al. 1994; Ham and Harrison 2000), from historical exposure of the Mayak workers (Khokhryakov et al. 1995, 2000; Suslova et al. 1996) and from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries (e.g., Ehrhart and Filipy 2001).  A number of modifications to the ICRP biokinetic model are now being proposed for addressing the biases described above (Eckerman KF 2003; personal communication).  
A post-ICRP systemic model has been developed and tested.  The post-ICRP model is expected to be more accurate than the ICRP model, but the ICRP systemic model is still considered the “gold standard”.  Thus, both models will be available for analysis of exposures.  The new post-ICRP model will be incorporated in the computer codes.
While other similar computer tools are available, this work represents an advancement of the state-of-the-art bioassay analysis and dose estimation for exposure to plutonium in the following areas:
1)	The computer codes performing intake determination by regression techniques can work in a batch mode, allowing analysis of multiple cases in the same run.  This feature is useful for performing multiple runs for the same individual (e.g., for different exposure dates, or particle sizes of inhaled plutonium), or for performing runs for a set of individuals with similar exposures.
2)	A new post-ICRP biokinetic model based on analysis of recent plutonium data from the Harwell, NRPB, Mayak and USTUR studies, will be incorporated in our computer codes.  The structure of the current biokinetic model will be modified by adding or removing compartments and by adding or removing transfers among various model compartments.  
3)	In addition to the uncertainty in the doses to the lung tissues, the computer codes developed here will quantify the uncertainty in the doses to organs other than lung (e.g., bone surfaces, bone marrow, liver, kidney, bladder, and other soft tissues in general).

4.	PROPOSED TASKS, DELIVERABLES, AND SCHEDULE
TASK 1 – Determination of plutonium intake and organ doses
The objective of this task is to develop computer software that allows determination of the intake of plutonium based on available bioassay data (e.g., urine, feces, whole-body or lung counts) and then, starting from the determined intake, allows estimation doses for all organs of interest.  The most recent ICRP and the post-ICRP biokinetic models will be used to determine plutonium intake and to estimate organ doses.  The code will allow the user to analyze either one individual or multiple individuals (batch mode) at a time.  The activity of plutonium inhaled, ingested or taken from a contaminated wound will be determined assuming that the intake was either acute or continuous.  Both committed and annual organ doses will be reported.   To operate the code the user will provide the necessary information regarding exposure such as type of bioassay, number of data bioassay points, the actual bioassay data points, assumed exposure date, exposure characteristics (e.g., particle size and chemical form for inhalation). 
The software produced in Task 1 will represent the first version of the computer code for determination of intakes and dose estimation.  In this version, the uncertainties in the organ doses will be determined using published uncertainty ranges (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston 2003; Goosens et al., 1998), with an emphasis on lung and red bone marrow doses.  
Note that the published studies on uncertainty ranges are either incomplete (e.g., Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003 and Huston et al. 2003 considered doses to only the respiratory tract tissues), or inconclusive (i.e., the experts included in the European Community expert elicitation do not agree regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the doses from plutonium - Goossens et al. 1998).  Also, all studies on the uncertainty in doses from plutonium refer to the current ICRP biokinetic models (or earlier version), and not to the more recent post-ICRP model. 
A detailed quantification of uncertainties in organ doses is the subject of Task 2 presented below.
Task 1 will have the following sub-tasks:
Sub-Task 1.A 		Development of a biokinetic database
Derivation of intake from an exposure to plutonium is performed using the intake retention and excretion functions (per unit intake – IRF/IEF).  The IRF/IEF functions can be calculated for any exposure conditions, by using the biokinetic model.  This sub-task will generate a database containing the IRF/IEF functions for given exposure conditions (e.g., inhalation of Type M and S plutonium attached to particles sizes 1 to 10 microns).  The intake determination portion of the computer code will use the IRF/IEF functions from this database to fit the bioassay data.
Note that the IRF/IEF functions for wound contamination depend on the treatment history of the wound.  A set of IRF/IEF functions will be provided to represent instantaneous and continuous transfers of plutonium to the blood stream.  The continuous transfer to the blood stream can be modeled assuming that the plutonium source was removed from the wound after, for instance, 30 days, 60 days or one year after the accident, and of course it can be modeled assuming that the source of plutonium has never been removed from the wound. 
Sub-Task 1.B		Development of a database of organ doses per unit intake
Plutonium organ doses are estimated starting with the intake determined from bioassay data analysis by using the ICRP and post-ICRP biokinetic and dosimetric models.  This task will pre-calculate a set of organ doses per unit intake for the same exposure conditions as those used in Sub-Task 1.A.  The organ dose from a determined intake will simply be estimated as the intake multiplied by the dose per unit intake.  This will ensure an efficient way of estimating doses, by eliminating the need of running the biokinetic and dosimetry codes for each exposure case analyzed. 
The organ doses per unit intake included in the database will use published uncertainty ranges (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003; Goosens et al. 1998). 
Sub-Task 1.C	Development of the computer code for intake determination and dose estimation
This sub-task focuses on the actual programming of the computer code to be used for intake determination from bioassay data analysis and estimation of organ doses from the determined intake.  This code will make use of the two databases developed for Sub-Tasks 1 and 2.
Weighted least-square regression will be used to determine intake.  This method is equivalent to the maximum likelihood method.  Regression techniques are useful for routine determination of intake in cases of single acute exposures or constant continuous exposures.  The equations used to derive the intake are similar to the ones used in the CINDY internal dosimetry computer code (Strenge et al. 1993).  
The computer code will be set up to allow analysis of multiple cases in the same run.  This feature is useful for performing multiple runs for the same individual (e.g., for different exposure dates or for different chemical forms of inhaled plutonium), or for performing runs for a set of individuals with similar exposures.
As discussed above, the uncertainties in the estimated doses will be based on published uncertainty ranges in the organ dose factors.
The computer code will be programmed in Analytica® programming language (Analytica 2003).  The Analytica® computer code will interact with Microsoft Access database where the bioassay data can be stored.  The main advantages of using this programming platform are (a) good interaction with a well-developed database management software, (b) availability in Analytica® of a powerful Monte-Carlo engine for proper error propagation, and (c) user-friendly interfaces.  
Sub-Task 1.D		Documentation of the computer software
The computer code will be self-documented.  A short technical documentation, however, will be provided in form of a report.  The technical documentation will briefly describe the techniques used to determine intake and estimate doses, and will discuss the choices of the uncertainties in the organ doses per unit intake from the existing, published values.  In addition, the documentation will include basic guidance for a user operating the code. 
DELIVERABLES for TASK 1
Sub-tasks 1.A to 1.D represent milestones in completing Task 1.  The main deliverables for Task 1 are the version 1.0 of the computer software for determination of intakes and estimation of doses and it’s technical documentation.  The databases developed in sub-Tasks 1.A and 1.B will be provided as part of the final computer code.  
Short progress reports will be delivered to NIOSH every two months.  
A representative of SENES Oak Ridge, Inc. will travel to NIOSH to deliver and demonstrate the computer software.  
SCHEDULE for TASK 1 
Task 1 will start at the beginning of the project and will be completed within 6 months.  

TASK 2 – Quantification of uncertainty in organ doses
Various attempts of quantification of uncertainties in the organ doses from inhalation or ingestion of plutonium have been done in the past (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003; Goosens et al. 1998).  Some published studies are incomplete (e.g., Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003 and Huston et al. 2003 considered doses to only the respiratory tract tissues).  Other studies are inconclusive.  For instance, the experts participating in the European Community expert elicitation do not agree regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the doses from plutonium (Goossens et al. 1998).  The uncertainty in the red bone marrow doses from inhalation of plutonium is listed as uncertainty range of 10 by some experts (95th/5th percentile ratio), while others state that it can be larger than a factor of 100.  All studies on uncertainty in doses from plutonium have been done using the current ICRP or older biokinetic models.  The uncertainties in the organ doses based on the more recent post-ICRP biokinetic model have not been estimated.  Also, no uncertainties in dose due to wound contamination have been estimated. 
The purpose of this task is to determine the uncertainties in the organ doses from inhalation, ingestion and wound contamination with plutonium.  Uncertainties will be estimated for tissues of the respiratory tract (including lung) and for all other organs of the body in the ICRP list of organs.  
The uncertainties in the dose per unit intake will be incorporated in the database of dose-per-unit-intake coefficients (see sub-Task 1.B above), so that the computer code developed in Task 1 will report both doses and associated uncertainties, with the necessary correlations between annual doses. 
Task 2 will have the following sub-tasks:
Sub-Task 2.A		Uncertainties in the plutonium biokinetic and dosimetric model
The purpose of this sub-task is to quantify the uncertainties in each parameter of the biokinetic and dosimetric model, for both the most recent ICRP and the post-ICRP model.  
Uncertainties in the parameters of the respiratory tract portion of the biokinetic model have been determined and documented by Huston (1995) and other publications following-up on his work (Bolch et al. 2001; Bolch et al. 2003; Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003).  This task will use the information already available for the respiratory tract, and will focus on determination of uncertainties in the parameters of systemic part of the biokinetic model. 
The uncertainties in the organ doses will be derived by assigning probability distributions functions as a description of the uncertainty in each parameter of the biokinetic and dosimetric model.  The uncertainties in the parameters will be propagated using Monte-Carlo methods for error propagation.  
Sub-Task 2.B		Quantifying the uncertainties in the organ doses per unit intake
The purpose of this sub-task is to generate dose-per-unit-intake dose coefficients for all necessary exposure conditions and incorporate them in the database of dose-per-unit-intake coefficients (see sub-Task 1.B above).  This will allow the computer code developed in Task 1 to report doses and associated uncertainties, with the necessary correlations between annual doses. 
DELIVERABLES for TASK 2
Sub-tasks 2.A and 2.B are milestones for Task 2.  The main deliverable of Task 2 is version 2.0 of the software for determination of intakes and estimation of doses.  This version will contain uncertainty ranges for organ doses resulting from a rigorous treatment of the uncertainty in the biokinetic and dosimetric model for plutonium.  The updated technical documentation will include details of the new treatment of uncertainties.  
Short progress reports will be delivered to NIOSH every two months.  
A representative of SENES Oak Ridge, Inc. will travel to NIOSH to deliver and demonstrate the software. 
SCHEDULE for TASK 2
Task 2 will start after Task 1 is completed and it is estimated that it will take 6 months to complete it.  Thus, the second version of the software will thus be completed about 1 year from the beginning of the project.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the purchase of 1 each Intellibus Network Interface Controller. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the Intellibus Development Cluster from The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA, pursuant to FAR 13.106 for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons.  In choosing a bus protocol for use in the advanced avionics architecture that may be developed into a flight system, several factors were considered critical:  (1) the protocol must be non-proprietary, (2) capable to be developed into a safety-critical system, and (3) had to include mature technology.  Only 2 contractors are known to have the capability to perform this effort, The Boeing Company and TT Tech North America (TT Tech item has been acquired under separate order).	 The Development Cluster shall meet the following criteria:  1-wire network rate - 20 kbps isochronous; 2-wire network rate - 12.5 Mpbs isochronous; 4-wire network rate - low to 12.5 Mbps synchronous; Multi-master-slave with peer to peer operation; Manchester (biphase) messaging format; Hardware independent physical layer; Minimum protocol efficiency 33%; Plug-and-play capability for device discovery. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. local time on May 14, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This notice is being issued as a result of the cancellation of ED-04-R-0005.  The qualifications have been revised from CMM Level 3 to CMM level 2.  Background:     Congress directed the Department of Education to "assist the States in developing effective methods for the electronic transfer of student records and in determining the number of migratory children in each State" in section 1308 (b)(1) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).  In particular, in section 1308(b)(2), Congress required the Department, in consultation with the States, to ensure the linkage of migrant student record systems for the purpose of electronically exchanging among the States health and educational information for migratory students.  The linkage of migrant student record systems, including those systems used before and after the enactment of NCLB, is to occur in a cost-effective manner.  Description:  The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Migrant Education (OME), anticipates acquiring the services of a contractor experienced in information technology (IT) and acquisition planning in support of federal agencies, to provide acquisition management assistance in planning, selecting, and managing acquisitions from other contractors and vendors.  In addition to other activities, the offeror will develop a performance work statement for a contractor to design and build a migrant student record linking mechanism that uses leading edge technology to link the existing State migrant student record systems in order for those systems to exchange information on migrant children.  The "linking mechanism" will be referred to as the Migrant Student Information Exchange System (MSIE) in this document.  In assisting the Department to meet its need, the following broad areas may be required:     1.  Developing performance work statements for planned acquisitions; 2.     Assisting with preparation of acquisition documents; 3.  Assisting with technical review of proposals; 4.  Performing feasibility studies of alternatives derived from market research ; 5.  Performing cost benefit analysis of alternatives; 6.  Developing business cases and budget requests; 7.  Assisting the COR with evaluation of existing migrant student record databases in preparation for developing MSIE user requirements; 8.     Assisting the COR with creation of the user and technical requirements for the MSIE; 9.  Attending meetings with State personnel and other customers to gather technical specifications for the planned acquisitions; 10. Assisting with pre-proposal meetings and request for information meetings; 11. Serving as technical advisor during the MSIE software development life cycle; 12. Assisting in the management of contract tasks with other contractors.

It is expected that the successful prime offeror MUST meet all of the following conditions:     1) Offeror has been appraised at Level 2 or higher of the Capability Maturity Model (i.e. for Software (SW-SMM), Integration (CMMI-SE/SW), or Software Acquisition (SA-CMM)) by an SEI-authorized Lead Appraiser.       As part of  its response to the solicitation offerors will be required to submit proof that the business units within the contractor organization that will be performing the software acquisition support work for the Department of Education are operating at one of the following levels as appraised by a CMM Appraisal Framework (CAF) compliant appraisal, including self-appraisals, led by a SEI authorized lead assessor/evaluator:     A.       Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM) Level 2 or higher; B.       Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model for Software Acquisition (SA-CMM) Level 2 or higher, or; C.       Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration for Systems and Software Engineering (CMMI-SE/SW) Level 2 or higher.     2) Prime offeror must perform at least 51% of work.     3) Offeror has prior understanding of the technical requirements for the general work to be performed through relevant work within past three years of comparable type and scope.     At least one of the relevant work experiences must have been in direct support of acquisition support or software development requirements defined in a statement of work or statement of objectives by a Federal Agency.

Offeror must demonstrate prior direct experience in planning acquisitions for software development projects in excess of $1 million and/or developing software development projects in excess of $1 million.

All future information about this acquisition including the solicitation and solicitation amendments will be distributed solely through www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation will be open to all offerors and the estimated release date is any time after June 1, 2004.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command has a requirement to procure additional engineering services to define, design, develop, program, document, integrate and deliver Aegis Combat System (ACS) baseline upgrades, improvements, and critical experiments.  The current ceiling was expected to provide a period of performance from April 1998 through September 2007; however, due to scope and budget increases for major programs such as Aegis Baseline 7 Phase I, Aegis/Missile Defense Agency joint initiatives and Aegis CG/DDG Open Architecture, the original ceiling contracted for is expected to be breeched two years earlier than expected.  NAVSEA contract N00024-98-C-5197 was awarded to Lockheed Martin, Maritime Systems & Sensors (LM/MS2) (formerly Lockheed Martin, Government Electronic Systems), Moorestown, NJ in April 1998.  LM/MS2, as the prime contractor for ACS and Aegis Weapon System (AWS) d evelopment since the program’s inception, is the only source with the required expertise to fulfill the Navy’s requirements without creating unnecessary delays in meeting Aegis Program Baseline Development schedules.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to BearingPoint LLC Lexington Park, MD, and its proposed team of IBM Global Services – Federal, Bethesda, MD, and EDS Corp., Herndon, VA, for the development and demonstration of Global Template 1.0 for the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) program.

An additional option will be included to support Global Template 1.0 OPEVAL deficiency correction and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) support if required for the program.  It is anticipated that a Cost-Type and Firm Fixed Price performance based contract will result from a request for proposal (RFP). The place of performance is expected to be at BearingPoint in Lexington Park and An napolis, MD and the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning Program Office in Rosslyn, VA.  The contract will be for a base period of 1 year and 4 one-year options. This is a continuation of services provided under a NAVAIR contract for the Navy ERP pilot project.  An RFP issuance is anticipated in the 3rd Quarter of FY 04.  Award is expected to be the 4th Quarter of GFY 04.  BearingPoint is the incumbent on the NAVAIR SIGMA pilot project.  The SIGMA financial management configuration, developed and deployed by BearingPoint at NAVAIR, will form the backbone of the Navy ERP system.  BearingPoint and its proposed team of subcontractors is the only source that can combine complete, detailed background knowledge of the financial management backbone with in-depth knowledge of the normalized functionality and configuration baseline.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

NREL has several pieces of intellectual property in this area and is looking for a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize this technology. The alliance could be a license, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), or a Work For Others (WFO) that leverages NREL’s unique capabilities, facilities, and personnel.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be needed to view the patent applications associated with this technology.  Information on technology transfer is available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization’s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.  Do not include any proprietary information in initial contact.  Please contact us by June 10th, 2004, to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  A business or product commercialization plan will be required from the potential licensee during the negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

NREL has several pieces of intellectual property in this area and is looking for a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize this technology. The alliance could be a license, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), or a Work For Others (WFO) that leverages NREL’s unique capabilities, facilities, and personnel.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be needed to view the patent applications associated with this technology.  Information on technology transfer is available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization’s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The proposed projects are located in the Bullfrog Springs drainage. Road 6210 crossing requires replacing the existing culvert with a permeable low water crossing for approximately 30 meters to distribute flows throughout crossing. The total project length is 85 meters. The estimated quantities are approximately 297 cm crushed aggregate subbase, 82 cm crushed aggregate base, 353-sm geotextile fabric.  Excavated material to be hauled about ¼ mile away.  Road 9732-300 will require building a permeable low water crossing for approximately 10 meters to permit water passage and sustain vehicle traffic. The total project length is 47 meters.  The estimated quantities are approximately 104 cm crushed aggregate subbase; 26 cm crushed aggregate base, and 167-sm geotextile fabric. Excavated material to be hauled about one-fourth mile away. 
The project can be reached from Klamath Falls by traveling north on Highway 97 approximately 25 miles to Crater Lake Highway 62. On Highway 62 go in a northerly direction approximately 5 miles to forest road 6210. Continue approximately 2 miles on road 6210 to the project site. From there go approximately 300 feet to the site on 9732-300.  This is a small business set-aside.
The Government's estimate is $25,000 to $50,000.  Expected issue date is May 26, 2004.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  René Hilaire Adiahéno, Deputy Secretary General, National Parks Council, B.P. 546, Libreville, Gabon , Phone: 241-72-77-51, Fax: 241-72-70-00.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to Gabon’s National Parks Council, the grantee, to investigate transportation to and in five of their national parks.

This Technical Assistance (TA) will be provided to a Gabonese governmental entity, the National Parks Council.  This body has been involved in the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) and hopes to attract tourists to the rainforest parks within Gabon.  This assistance will look at improving airports / landing strips in the proximity of the parks.  Currently, small airplanes transport visitors to the parks with airstrip access.  The other parks can be navigated to by road, which often can be quite arduous.  Making these sights easier and safer to access is of high importance to this assistance. The TA team will also investigate the roads that connect various points within the parks to make them more assessable to tourists.

This assistance to the Government of Gabon (GOG) will produce an unbiased development plan with an accurate cost and benefit analysis of transportation infrastructure improvements to its national parks.  The successful completion of the assistance will help the GOG to create a strategy that could be modeled in the other CBFP countries.

U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has signed a grant agreement with the National Parks Council for the above mentioned TA.  The terms of reference for the National Park Transportation Development TA include:

·	Technical Analysis
·	Economic Analysis
·	Financial Analysis
·	Environmental Analysis
·	Review of Regulatory Issues
·	List of Proposed Equipment, including U.S. Sources of Supply
·	Implementation Plan
·	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $162,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and French directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM on June 25, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Andrés Guzmán Tascón, Jefe División, Acceso Universal a la Sociedad de la Información, Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones, Amunátegui 139, Santiago - CHILE.
Phone:  011-56-2-421-3588; Fax:  011-56-2-421-3020
The Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Rural Connectivity Project in Chile.

The Rural Connectivity Project is designed to address the digital divide in Chile.  The Grantee plans to auction concessions for rural internet access services to private sector operators.  The operators will be required to offer internet access services in rural areas at subscriber rates comparable to those available in urban areas.  The winning bidders would be compensated for the relatively higher cost of providing rural internet access with a one-time, up front subsidy.  Bidders will compete based on the basis of the least subsidy required.  Funds for the subsidy will come from the Chilean government’s Telecommunications Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo de Telecomunicaciones, FDT) and a partial allocation of a loan for rural infrastructure from the World Bank.  With the support of the Netherlands consultants trust fund at the World Bank, the Grantee contracted with consultants to carry out a pre-feasibility study, which developed preliminary estimates of demand, recommended the appropriate technologies, and developed a preliminary business model that estimated that the US$15 million subsidy would make internet connection available for approximately 1,000 rural localities. 

The objective of the feasibility study is to assist the Grantee with the preparation of more precise data needed to conduct an efficient auction for concessions to provide rural internet access.  The Grantee needs more accurate demand data, including the potential demand for Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services in order to help bidders more accurately gauge the level of risk.  The other key information needed for the bidding process is more precise capital expenditure and operating cost data in order to more accurately define the conditions of the bidding process, such as the maximum allowable subsidy.

A summary of the specific tasks is as follows:

Task 1:  Conduct demand study (which will include in-field polling)
Task 2:  Develop precise picture of network designs and resulting capital expenditure and
  operating costs
Task 3:  Evaluate the potential of VOIP service as a source of additional revenues and 
  profit for the concession operators
Task 4:  Validate the logic and underlying assumptions of the business 
  model developed in the pre-feasibility study
Task 5:  Prepare a preliminary review of the project’s environmental impacts and
 potential mitigating measures
Task 6:  Organize a workshop to solicit feedback from potential operators, subscribers, 
  equipment suppliers, regulators, international organizations, and consultants
Task 7:  Compute new estimates of the expected subsidy amounts required
Task 8:  Provide advisory support to SUBTEL on the preparation of draft tender 
 documents
Task 9:  Present all findings and recommendations to SUBTEL
Task 10: Prepare Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $253,402 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The National Association of Drug Court Professionals , Alexandria, VA . 
Purpose:
The NADCP is a national membership organization of adult, juvenile, and family drug treatment courts.  These drug courts are throughout the country and abroad. NADCP is a prominent force in the rapid expansion of drug courts.  SAMHSA/CSAT has entered into a working partnership with NADCP in order to ensure drug courts have effective clinical interventions, and the annual training conferences are a key mechanism to further SAMHSA/CSAT goals.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration=s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) is encouraging the development of three court models.  These models are

Family Treatment Drug Court -  designed to improve the way courts handle child abuse and neglect cases involving parent(s) with substance use disorders,
Adult Treatment Drug Court -  designed to improve the way courts handle criminal cases involving adults with substance use disorders, and
Juvenile Treatment Drug Court -  designed to improve the way courts handle criminal cases involving juveniles with substance use disorder.

The drug court field is expanding dramatically.  Below are estimates of the number of drug courts:
Family Treatment Drug Court - about 80 operational and 75 courts in the planning process,
Adult Treatment Drug Courts - about 1200 operational and 250 in the planning process; and
 
Juvenile Treatment Drug Courts - about 350 operational and 112 in the planning process.

SAMHSA/CSAT currently funds forty-three treatment drug courts.

The purpose is to further SAMHSA/CSAT's program goal of providing training and information to current and potential treatment drug courts in order to improve their clinical interventions and to improve their overall effectiveness. SAMHSA/CSAT will jointly develop the family drug court portion of the training conference with NADCP. 
The National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks.    This conference is being held by NADCP for its members and professionals in the field.  SAMHSA/CSAT is a primary sponsor of the NADCP's 10th Annual Drug Court Training Conference.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Electronic and Electrical Engineering Laboratory (EEEL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado-Denver, Department of Physics, for the modeling, design, fabrication, testing, and integration of very large arrays of anisotropic magneto-resistance (AMR) sensors.  The goal will be to develop an array that is capable of imaging magnetic data storage tapes with very high resolution in real time.  The contractor must be experienced in modeling the behavior of dual stripe AMR sensors.  This includes modeling the resistance and magnetic bias of adjacent magnetic layers.  The contractor must be capable of developing a second harmonic detection technique based on these devices.  ****   The contractor must be proficient with all fabrication steps including:  (1)  Reticule design and processing with a pattern generator; (2) deposition and patterning of magnetic multilayers using sputtering and liftoff;  (3) deposition and patterning of SiO2 using silane based CVD and dry etch; and (4) deep reactive ion etching on Si wafers.  The contractor will also be responsible for programming a digital signal processing system to acquire both DC and AC current bias-second harmonic data acquisition from the array.  ****   The UCD Physics Department has specific expertise and experience in the design and fabrication of magnetic sensor arrays in the NIST’s MANUALLY OPERATED clean room facility where all work must be performed.  Specifically, the project involves fabrication processes that have already been developed by personnel now at UCD.  These processes include significant non-recurring engineering costs: the development of scripts to control the reticle design software, processes to conduct dry etching, wet etching, liftoff, and deep reactive ion etches of the devices.  ****   No solicitation for this requirement is available.  Any responses to this Notice will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive procurement will be in the best interests of the Government and must specifically address the skills, experience and knowledge set forth in this Notice.   ****   Any questions or responses should be addressed in writing to Michelle Sandoval, Purchasing Agent, by mail (MASC/AMD, MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO  80305), email (Michelle.Sandoval@noaa.gov ) or fax (303-497-3163).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command plans to contract with a Joint Venture team formed by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Company for Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) services associated with systems under the management of the Pro gram Executive Officer for Air Space and Missile Defense (PEO ASMD).  These systems include PATRIOT/MEADS, JLENS, JTAGS, Sentinel, SLAMRAAM and  THAAD.  Taken together, these systems are referred to as the ASMD System of Systems (SoS).  Enhanced joint and service capabilities desired for the SoS will be accomplished through a rigorous process of SE&I and configuration management.  The objective of this activity is to improve the ability of the affected systems, operating together as an SoS and independently  as individual components, to share and utilize data among themselves and from external sources in the execution of their mission requirements.  The required engineering activities include: trade studies and analysis leading to a balanced set of performanc e and interface requirements to be implemented by individual systems/components; design requirements for the development of a Common Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence component capable of being configured to co ntrol and optimize the engagement of the full spectrum of ASMD threats utilizing the SoS; evaluation and recommendation of modifications to existing SoS component/sub-component designs and performance requirements; evaluation and proposed realignment and s ynchronization of SoS component development and delivery schedules.  The contractor will be required to develop a simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (SIM/HWIL)  in order to perform trades and analysis as well as validation of derived SoS performance requi rements; establish SoS characterization test plans and provide technical support for Government conducted SoS tests; and provide data and analysis to support milestone decision review processes for the SoS and its individual components. A key subset of the  overall ASMD SoS SE&I requirement involves SE&I support to the Combined Aggregate Program (CAP). The CAP is an accelerated merger of evolving MEADS capabilities into the existing Patriot system. The products of this SoS SE&I effort are urgently needed in order to provide more effective, efficient and coordinated capabilities to the warfighter. The government has determined that it is necessary to contract with a Lockheed Martin and Raytheon JV team for this effort due to their unique knowledge and experien ce with the component systems which comprise the ASMD SoS. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are the prime contractors or major subcontractors on most of the SoS component systems in question. Their combined expertise and experience is required for this SoS SE& I effort. The government has invested billions of dollars and many years in component system prime and subcontracts with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. A substantial portion of this investment would have to duplicated before any source other than Lockheed M artin and Raytheon could acquire the necessary capabilities to perform this requirement. Such duplication of cost would not be recovered through competitive acquisition of this SE&I requirement, nor could the government tolerate the delay associated with a llowing another source the necessary time to ramp-up to the required capabilities already possessed by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.  See note 22.

<DESC>WBGS-RF BAA 04-19 Modification:
 
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under this BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal or submit any documentation that may be classified, the following information is applicable.

If proposers submit classified efforts (relating, for example to specific module performance specifications for a classified application) as part of their proposal abstract or full proposal, the proposed effort should be structured so as to minimize the amount of work that must be protected.  The statement of work element that will be classified must be clearly identified and the level of classification should be no higher than Secret/Collateral.  Information describing and supporting such a proposed classified effort should be detailed in classified addendums separately from the proposal abstract and the full proposal.  The length of any addendums will be considered as part of the total proposal-abstract/full-proposal page count. 

Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  Applicable classification guide(s) should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.

<DESC>Since there are multiple applicable Modeling and Simulation (M&S) software codes, potential offerors will be responsible for demonstrating best value to the Government.  The Government has therefore deleted the requirement to obtain access to proprietary M&S computer code (ISAAC and ABLE).  Based upon this change, the Draft Task Statement (Statement of Work) has been updated accordingly.

THE PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION, ALONG WITH ALL UPDATES/MODIFICATIONS, IS HEREBY REPLACED IN ITS ENTIRETY WITH THE FOLLOWING:

The ABL Element of the Missile Defense Agency, Kirtland Air Force Base NM is contemplating an award of a contract to provide advisory and assistance services (A&AS).  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. This procurement is a follow-on action to the current ABL A&AS contract that is scheduled to expire 31 March, 2005.  This requirement covers the A&AS requirements for MDA/AL including but not limited to Airborne Laser, Airborne Sensors and Laser Technology Program.  The ABL is a high-energy laser system integrated on a Boeing 747 aircraft that is being tested for destroying theater ballistic missiles in their boost phase.
	At present, the ABL office requires approximately 107 man-year (per year) equivalent heads of A&AS support.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall support, provide expertise and oversight/insight and participate in ABL integrated product teams.  The current integrated product teams include:  Aircraft; Airborne Sensors; Battle Management Command, Control and Communication Computers and Integration and Intelligence (BMC4I); Beam Control/Fire Control (BC/FC); Ground Support and Laser IPTs.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall support the ABL office through engineering analyses, segment modeling and simulation, and review and evaluation of segment concepts, architectures and designs.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall also provide specific segment modeling and simulation support to include wave optics and scaling laws, BMC4I predictive avoidance analysis, and Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) design analysis.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall provide specific segment design engineering analysis for atmospheric characterization (turbulence statistics and cloud analysis), laser beam quality, adaptive optics, large optic designs, vibration, aero-optics, the pressure recovery subsystem, and acquisition, tracking and pointing.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall provide specific system modeling and simulation.  The A&AS contractor(s) must have extensive, in-depth and current experience with High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon system technologies, systems and applications, as well as hands-on experience in analysis/experiments and testing with the HEL technologies.  Expertise is required in laser physics, physics, gas dynamics, optical engineering, electro-optics and structural engineering (thermal/mechanical).  Extensive experience is required in COIL for the ABL weapon and solid state lasers for the ABL illuminator, including integrated laser/optical resonator analysis, pressure recovery system, laser chemistry and optical non-linear phenomena.  Experience is also required in high energy laser weapon system beam control, vibration isolation/control, integrated laser controls, laser tracking and pointing and laser beam aim point maintenance, as well as atmospheric turbulence analysis, wave optics codes, high energy laser propagation, atmospheric compensation and adaptive optics.  ABL also requires experience in missile tracking/signatures, high energy laser effects, passive/active missile tracking algorithms and damage assessment for HEL effects, as well as systems-level modeling and simulation to include airborne HEL weapon systems and subsystems, aircraft platforms, atmospheric propagation, ballistic missile threats and mission and campaign-level engagement performance analysis.  Finally, the contractor shall provide support in the areas of security, computer network information technology, technical writing, and graphic support, as well as specialized support in contracting, personnel, and program control. 
	A copy of the draft A&AS Statement of Work (SOW), upon which the forecasted work and this sources sought synopsis is based, can be found with this announcement and at http://www.acq.osd.mil/bmdo/barbb/barbb.htm.  
	Personnel on the A&AS contract shall have a minimum of a Secret clearance, Completed National Agency Check (NAC), or have submitted for a NAC in order to use government information systems and/or to access certain ABL unclassified information.  Access to classified information requires either a final or interim clearance at the appropriate level. Approximately 80% of the personnel that would support this A&AS contract will require a Top Secret (single scope background investigation [SSBI]) clearance that is current within the last five years.  Please contact the Contracting Officer if additional information is necessary (please provide your CAGE code with this request).  Potential offerors shall submit statements of capabilities (SOCs) to this office. Each SOC shall specifically address each SOW paragraph.  Additionally, the SOC package shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:  1) Experience:  an outline of previous efforts, specific work previously performed and any in-house effort, relevant to the specific task areas of this effort; including a proposed organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan (not included in the page limitation), if required; and 2) Personnel: the names, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who will be assigned to work in areas of interest.  The SOCs must be received by the SPO POC listed below on 25 May 2004.  There is a 45 page SOC page limitation, and submissions must be unclassified.  All replies to this synopsis must reference this sources sought synopsis and number FA8632-04-R-2453.  Submit all responses to ASC/TMK, Attn:  Martin Baca, 1350 Wyoming Blvd SE, Bldg 20200, Kirtland AFB, NM  87117-5536.
	The contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), five-year task order contract.  Anticipate contract award in December, 2004.  This acquisition will be procured using full and open competition procedures.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a large, small, an 8(a), a HUBZone small business, a veteran owned small business, a service disabled veteran small business, a historically black college or university, women-owned business, or a minority institution.  For this proposed acquisition and using the small business size standard for NAICS code 541710, the size standard of 500 employees applies.  Foreign firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are any restrictions on receiving award.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact Mr. Mike O’Neill at 703.695.9122.  For contracting issues, please contact Mr. Martin Baca at 505.846.0775.  The specifics on an industry day, if desired, will be published in FedBizOpps and is planned after release of the Draft RFP.  See Numbered Notes: 25 and 26.

<DESC>HSCG87-04-R-643104 - Multiple Award Task Order Contract with design-build capabilities for USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.  This solicitation is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures (FAR Subpart 36.300).  For this contract award process, USCG will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure is to determine which Offerors demonstrate the highest qualifications to successfully deliver the construction and design-build services on an as-needed basis. All responsible small business sources may submit a Phase One Proposal; consistent with FAR 15.306(a)(2), for the purposes of efficiency, a maximum of eight (8) design-build entities that are found to demonstrate the highest qualifications will be selected to participate in Phase Two.  Upon completion of the Phase One competition, a determination will be made regarding further set-asides under Phase Two.  Work anticipated under this project falls within NAICS Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  It is anticipated this procurement will result in award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ (task order) construction contracts with design-build capability, primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The work will be located in Alaska, primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be in effect for one year from the date of award with four one-year renewal options.  Award of contracts is anticipated to take place in late September or early October of 2004 dependent upon availability of funding for the initial project and minimum guarantees.  Funds are not presently available for this project.  No award will be made until funds are available.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time prior to award.  The total value of all contracts combined will not exceed $40 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee will be $50,000 per contract.  Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to a maximum size of $3,000,000 per order with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The awardees will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which will vary in stage of design completion from approximately 35% to 100%.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements may result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features in accordance with LEED.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State where the project is located.  Phase One of the acquisition process will be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on:  Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, Past Performance, Technical Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the successful Phase One offerors will submit technical and price proposals for an initial project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  Offer guarantees/bid bonds will be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal will be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the contractor is awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Subject to the "fair opportunity" ordering provisions of the contract and FAR 16.505(b), Orders under multiple award contracts, future task orders will be competed among the firms that are awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about June 14, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

<DESC>The Department is herein clarifying that the April 1, 2004 announcement of a competitive sourcing effort under Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 pertains to services in support of the Office of Multifamily Housing’s administration of rental housing subsidies in the Section 202, 811, 236 and Rental Assistance Programs.  This is not to be confused with and does not affect in any way the Department’s efforts in regards to Performance Based Contract Administrators who provide contract administration services for the Project Based Section 8 portfolio.  HUD currently devotes an estimated 60 to 80 full time equivalent staffing level to administer the estimated 4,000 Section 202, 811, 236 and Rental Assistance Program agreements that will be covered by this competition.  Due to the complexity of the activity, the projected end date of the competition is 18 months from the original posted date of April 1, 2004.

There currently are no incumbent service providers performing the program monitoring and administrative functions anticipated to be covered by this competition.  It should be noted that General Accounting Office and the HUD Office of Inspector General have reported that this activity is not adequately being performed.

The purpose of this competition is to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means for providing the required services.  This will be accomplished by conducting a competitive procurement between the Government’s Most Efficient Organization and other non-federal sources.  Please note that a contract may or may not ultimately be awarded as a result of this competition.  Further announcements concerning this effort will be forthcoming.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is De Ritchie, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Contracting Officer is Catherine Haddon, and the Agency Tender Official is J. Patrick Goray.

It is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s program of assistance that is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources; and improved primary healthcare.  USAID/Almaty manages all USAID assistance for the five Central Asian Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.  Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from 150 years of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particularly difficult challenge for USAID.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  This document is for information and planning purposes only and will allow industry the opportunity to verify the reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement and to submit a capability statement.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.  It is not known at this time if a solicitation will result from this request for information (RFI).  If a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on the NASA ARC Business Opportunities website     http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=21    .  Source qualifications should be limited to ten pages and submitted in electronic format by email to  Audrey.A.Guerra@nasa.gov or by facsimile to (650) 604-0912 by the response date specified.  In responding, reference RFI NNA04063612. NASA Ames is hereby soliciting information from industry to determine the existence of sources who can provide contractor services for administratively closing acquisition instruments at each of the 9 Field Centers to include, NASA Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Johnson Space Center, Stennis Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Glenn Research Center, Langley Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, and the NASA Management Office (NMO) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Overall coordination of NASA activities is provided by NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  Acquisition instruments include contracts, purchase orders, grants and cooperative agreements and other contractual instruments. The Contractor shall provide all management, personnel, equipment, materials and facilities (unless otherwise identified as provided by the Government in the contract or in a task order) to perform the work described in this Statement of Work.  The Contractor shall manage the work to be performed under the contract including closing all acquisition instruments in accordance with the FAR, NASA FAR Supplement, and all applicable laws, regulations, etc.  The Contractor shall also assure the availability of qualified personnel for timely response to task orders, and manage all task orders according to the Contractor’s Management Plan.	Task Orders may be added, deleted, or modified as Agency, Center/NMO goals change.  The contractor may be required to utilize the existing financial management system to assist in the closeout process. The Contractor will perform closeout activities in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.8 and NASA FAR supplement (NFS) 1804.8, or using quick closeout procedures in accordance with FAR 42.708 and NFS 1842.708.  Grants closeout will be in accordance with the Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook (NPG 5800.1D).  The FAR, NFS, and NPG (under NASA Directives) may be found at	    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/nais/index.cgi	.  The contractor(s) will inventory files and maintain a closeout-tracking log.  Additional requirements, i.e. number/types of closeouts, specific actions required, performance standards, etc., will be detailed on individual task orders issued by each Center.  The contractor will be required to complete closeout of all acquisition instruments identified on any individual task order within the timeframes specified in the FAR, NFS, and Grant Handbook or on the task order.  For example, Cost Plus contracts must be closed within 36 months of physical completion whereas Firm Fixed Price contracts require closeout within 6 months of physical completion.  Closeout will be required within these timeframes unless delays otherwise explained and new dates that are forecast on progress reports have been accepted.  The Contractor shall develop and maintain a tracking system and reports that include the status, location, and current actions pertaining to the closeout of purchase orders, contracts, grants and cooperative agreements, and other agreements.  Center/NMO specific requirements for these records will be provided in each task order. It is anticipated the contract will be a cost plus fixed fee with task orders issued by individual Centers. The anticipated performance period will be a one-year base period, plus four one-year each option periods.  The estimated price of this contract is approximately $14 million over the entire five-year performance period for all Centers.  As the number of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and purchase orders requiring closeout vary from Center to Center, the estimated contract value is not spread evenly across all the Centers.  For all centers, the total estimated number of contractual instruments to close is 25,000.  The anticipated award date for this requirement is July 31 (FY) 2005.  The NAIC code and SBA size standard for this requirement is 561110 and $6 million respectively.   Interested and qualified sources are requested to provide a statement of current capability and past performance information.  Sources must demonstrate management and technical experience on similar acquisitions specifically addressing the requirements specified in this synopsis and demonstrate the ability to successfully compete for this requirement. The following information should be provided: 1.	Submit a capability statement of ten (10) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.    2.	A description of the respondent’s past experience in successfully performing this type of contract, including a description of the contract and name and phone number of the point of contact for the purchasing organization. 3.	Company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers and type and business size, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), HUBZone small business, and/or woman-owned small business; service-disabled small business, veteran-owned small business; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Audrey Guerra no later than COB June 14, 2004.	This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  B. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the NASA ombudsman. Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified elsewhere in this document.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Persons may identify their interest and capability (statement) to respond to the requirement (see xvi).  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  See numbered Note 22 for further specifics.

(ii) This Solicitation HQ0095-04-T-0066 is a Request for Quote (RFQ) for summer interns. 

(iii) This Solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13, effective April 05, 2004..

(iv) The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the corresponding size standard is $6.0 million.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not cover this procurement.

(v) & (vi) CLIN 0001:  Provide four (4) Native-American Interns for employment at the Department of Defense (DOD) during Summer 2004 (June 7, 2004 through August 27, 2004).  Washington Internships for Native Students Program General Requirement:  The Department of Defense is committed to increasing representation of persons of Native-American backgrounds within the overall DoD work force.  A key method of accomplishing this requirement is to better inform students at colleges and universities of employment possibilities with DoD upon graduation through temporary internships of such students in DoD facilities during summer months, as well as during the fall and spring semesters. How the Requirement Developed: The Washington Internships for Native Students (WINS) program is a visionary effort founded on the idea that young people of the sovereign Native American nations can build leadership skills while living, studying, and interning in Washington, D. C., and can then bring those skills back to their communities.  The WINS program is administered by the Washington Semester and World Capitals Programs of American University.  We believe this is an exciting opportunity for us to target a hard-to-reach minority population. Overall Program Objectives: The primary goal is to increase the visibility of DoD within the Native American communities in order to enhance employment opportunities for a wide range of persons. The expectation is that the interns who are assigned within DoD offices will either themselves apply for permanent positions with DoD upon graduation, or at the very least, communicate a favorable impression of DoD as an employer to fellow students, family members, and friends.  Specific Objectives of the Requirement:
Participating interns are provided assignment placements to the maximum extent possible into offices closely matching their areas of interest and expertise.  This will serve the two-fold purpose of ensuring that they are able to use their skills in meaningful employment opportunities, and that the offices to which they are assigned achieve maximum benefit of their skills and knowledge in specific functional areas of science, management, financial operations, technology, program planning, or other fields of study.
Supplier Requirements:  WINS will provide the following services: recruitment of participants; employment (receiving and processing applications, matching assignments); orientation in Washington DC prior to entry on duty; developmental activities; assisting interns in obtaining academic credit for program participation; support services such as program handbooks and updates, communication; housing assistance; travel expenses to Washington DC area;  program evaluation. Direction on Specific Methodologies to be used: Merit principles and careful matching of candidate to employment opportunities. Applicability of Specification and Standards: Interns will be fully qualified in specific skill set forth by offices in which assigned, and will meet any security requirements. Period of Performance: The period of performance is June 7, 2004 through August 27, 2004. Government-furnished elements:
Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and other participating components serviced by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) will provide office space and requisite office equipment for use by interns during their service. Government Review and Approval: A staff member of WHS, Personnel and Security Directorate (P&SD) will serve as the internal program manager to provide assistance to management officials and to interns as required.  At the completion of the program, the staff member will also assess the effectiveness of the program to determine if it should continue in future years. Reporting Requirements: WHS, P&SD will be continuously monitoring the process to ensure optimum placement opportunities, and overall quality and performance of interns once on board.  WHS, P&SD will also work closely with WINS to resolve any operational problems that may arise. Control Procedures: The WHS, P&SD specialist will work closely with WINS’s Program Manager to ensure the highest quality interns, and with OSD managers to ensure that realistic work opportunities are identified to match skills and requirements.

<DESC>CBD COMBINED/SYNOPSIS SOLICTATION

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source – National Association of Equal Employment Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Persons may identify their interest and capability (statement) to respond to the requirement (see xvi).  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  See numbered Note 22 for further specifics.

(ii) This Solicitation HQ009504T0067 is a Request for Quote (RFQ) for summer interns. 

(iii) This Solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13, effective April 5, 2004.

(iv) The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the corresponding size standard is $6.0 million.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not cover this procurement.

(v) & (vi) CLIN 0001:  Provide four (4) African-American Interns for employment at the Department of Defense (DOD) during Summer 2003 (June 7, 2004 through August 27, 2004).  National Association of Equal Employment Opportunity in Higher Education Internship Program General Requirement:  The Department of Defense is committed to increasing representation of persons of African-American backgrounds within the overall DoD work force.  A key method of accomplishing this requirement is to better inform students attending historically black colleges and universities of employment possibilities with DoD upon graduation through temporary internships of such students in DoD facilities during summer break.  How the Requirement Developed:  In 1987, the National Association for Equal Employment Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) was awarded a grant by the U.S. Department of Defense to increase participation of HBCU’s and Minority Institutions (Mis) in DoD sponsored activities.  In March 1999, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense, Force Management Policy stated that supporting the NAFEO internship program is a “valuable and effective way of introducing talented young men and women to the challenges and rewards of public service.”  The NAFEO internship program provides opportunities for students from participating Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to work at government agencies in order to provide the students with the opportunity to meet executive and senior staff officers and engage in meaningful dialogue, learning experiences and interactions with federal officials.  The use of the internship program provided by NAFEO enables DoD to bring into the workplace a number of highly qualified individuals.  By obtaining NAFEO’s services, these interns remain employees of NAFEO, which is more expeditious method of recruitment than employing persons who would have become temporary Federal employees during the summer period.  Overall Program Objectives:  The primary goal is to continue to increase the visibility of DoD within the African American community in order to enhance employment opportunities for a wide range of persons.  The expectation is that the interns who work within DoD offices will either themselves apply for permanent positions within DoD upon graduation, or at the very least, communicate a favorable impression of DoD as an employer to fellow students, family members, and friends.  Specific Objectives:  Participating interns are provided employment placement to the maximum extent possible into offices closely matching their areas of interest and expertise.  This will serve the two-fold purpose of ensuring that they are able to use their skills in meaningful employment opportunities, and that the offices to which they are assigned achieve maximum benefit of their skills and knowledge in specific functional areas of science, management, financial operations, technology, program planning, or other fields of study.  Supplier Requirements:  NAFEO will provide the following services:  recruitment of participants; employment (receiving and processing applications); orientation in Washington, DC prior to entry on duty; developmental activities; support services such as program handbooks and updates, communication; housing assistance; travel expenses to DC area; program evaluation.  Direction on Specific Methodologies to be used:  Merit principles and careful matching of candidate to employment opportunities.  Applicability of Specification and Standards:  Interns will be fully qualified in specific skill set forth by offices in which employed, and will meet any security requirements.  Period of Performance:  The period of this performance period is for one fiscal year beginning June 7, 2004 through August 27, 2004.  Government-furnished elements:  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and other participating components serviced by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) will provide office space and requisite office equipment for use by interns during their service.  Review and Approval:  A staff member of WHS, Personnel and Security Directorate (P&SD) will serve as the internal program manager to provide assistance to management officials and to interns as required.  Also, will assess the effectiveness of the program as its completion to determine if it should continue in future years.  Reporting Requirements:  The WHS, P&SD will be continuously monitoring the process to ensure optimum placement opportunities, and overall quality and performance of interns once on board.  Will work closely with NAFEO to resolve any operational problems that may arise, plus to assess the program at the end of the summer.  Control Procedures:  The WHS, P&SD specialist will work closely with NAFEO’s Program Manager to ensure the highest quality interns, and with OSD managers to ensure that realistic work opportunities are identified to match skills and requirements.  A continuous monitoring will be conducted to quickly and efficiently resolve any program problems.  Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:  The selection process will result in a group of highly qualified interns to be placed in participating offices.  Interns are subject to review in terms of qualifications and security requirements, and will be in-processed to the extent necessary upon their reporting dates.

(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point: See Item number (v & vi) for dates/performance period.

•	Proposed Government-wide legislation affecting either the Civil Service and/or the Foreign Service;
•	Directives developed by Agency offices; and.
•	New or revised sections of the Foreign Affairs Manual and the Standardized Regulations.

Continuing job responsibilities include providing service to HR customers, answering inquiries, conducting research, collecting data and preparing analyses on policy initiatives, analyzing current and proposed personnel legislation and regulatory changes, reviewing existing Agency directives to recommend conforming policy and procedural changes, developing new HR programs and implementing policy directives including written supplementary guidance, preparing and issuing Agency notices and decision memoranda or a recurring nature, reviewing rules posted in the Federal Register and other guidance issued by the Office of Personnel management (OPM) for relevance to the Agency and its human resources operation and disseminating OPM information to responsible HR staff and other office in the Agency.

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process based upon merits of the offer and the offeror’s capability.  Under a best value source selection, nonprice evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  USAID will consider an Offeror’s past performance and experience to be more important than its price.  However, the USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.

The system in ITEM 0001 shall provide the capability to duplicate (1) 25Mbps Digital video recorders/editors and consists of (2) digital video decks recorders/editors, (5) Professional VHS videotapes requiring (6) VHS decks, and (3) DVD+-R’s requiring (4) DVD+-R recorders.  ITEM 0002 System Training - The contractor shall train 4 Marines and personnel of the Instructional Media Center on the proper operation of the duplication system within 30 days after installation.  ITEM 0003 - Warranty and Service - The entire duplication system will be warranted for a period of no less than three years.

The Instructional Media Center will ship the component requiring maintenance or repair to a certified repair facility designated by the contractor, and the contractor will fund for shipping back to the Instructional Media Center, Marine Corps Combat Service Support School, Camp Johnson, North Carolina.  The contractor will ensure that all maintenance is accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended schedule of preventive maintenance for that component.  The contractor will ensure that all repairs are completed to a component of the video duplication system within seven (7) normal working days after the component has been received at the designated repair facility and that the component is shipped back to the Instructional Media Center on the seventh day.  This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, 100 percent small-business set-aside, NAICS Code 334310, small-business size standard of 750 employees, for the Video Duplication System in accordance with FAR 13.1 for simplified acquisitions and FAR 12.6 for commercial items as defined in FAR Part 2.1, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement includes the following tasks:
Design.  The contractor will design a duplication system that will be ergonomically friendly for the end user and will be correctly labeled to ensure ease of use.  
Procure.  In addition to all specified system components for ITEMS 0001, 0002 and 0003, the contractor will also procure the necessary switching equipment, monitors, rack(s), rack mounts, and power distribution.  The 25Mbps Digital Video recorders/editors must be able to play back both consumer DV, 25Mbps DVCAM and DVCPro. The digital video decks should also have IEEE 1394 DV I/O interfaces, DI/SDTI/AES/EBU interfaces, component, composite, S-video, and RS-422A interfaces.

Each one of the recorders must be connected so that they can be monitored independently for quality control of the duplication.  All cabling of the recorders, monitors, and switching equipment will be as such to allow for each deck to be pulled out without disconnecting the cabling from the rear of the recorder.  All cables will be tie-wrapped to the frame of the rack(s) to ensure a neat and clean, professional appearance.
Assemble and Test.  The contractor will assemble the video duplication system at a location designated by the contractor, and perform an operational test of the video duplication system before delivery.  The contractor must supply a certification in writing that the system performed and operated properly before it can be shipped to the installation location.

<DESC>(i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in 
accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information
included in this notice.  This proposed action is for supplies for which the Government 
intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Intelligent Devices, Inc., under authority
of FAR 6.302-1.  Persons may identify their interest and capability (statement) to respond to the requirement (see xiv).  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR
COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  See numbered Note 22 for further specifics.

(ii)  This solicitation is for the integration of a modern, software-based, audio amplifier, for two prototypes and a first article.   Delivery schedule/period of performance is to be proposed by contractor. 

(iii)	This solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23, effective May 05, 2004.

(iv)	The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 334310 and the corresponding size/number of employees is 750.

(v)& (vi) CLIN 0001-Prototype; CLIN 0002-Prototype; CLIN 0003-First Article. The Performance Work Statement (PWS) with specifications for the items follows:

1.0	Introduction

	This PWS is for the integration of a modern, software-based, audio amplifier system.  This system will be designed to give the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense the most effective capability in extracting audio from any fortuitous conductor by combining hardware amplification with the power of digital signal processing.  This product will be a hybrid of an audio amplifier and speech extraction software.  This product will be capable of covertly intercepting audio while performing additional functions such as off-hook loading, positive and negative DC injection, and differential monitoring, and then digitally processing any speech using specialized software.

2.0	Background

The Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Program has utilized several audio amplifiers over the last decade for checking conductors for unauthorized audio transmission.  Traditional line amplifiers do very well at amplification if the signal is relatively clean.  Unfortunately, any noise that has corrupted on the line is also amplified.  To remove unwanted noise, there are new frequency domain, software-based, audio filter/speech extraction technologies that surpass hardware-based products.  The opportunity now exists to marry the two technologies into a specialized package designed for our unique requirements. 

3.0	Scope

The Contractor shall integrate a product that will consist of a portable, battery powered, integrated unit consisting of a hand-held computer with telephone interface hardware, all necessary input/output connections, and a full color graphic touch-screen with simple user interface for control of all onboard functions. Both analog (such as test tone generation and adjustment of DC injection) and digital (such as forensic audio) functions will be controlled using the onboard color graphic touch-screen.  All other signal processing functions, including the comb/notch and band-pass filter, are handled digitally within the specialized software.

4.0	Requirements

4.1	The Contractor shall ensure the system is electrically isolated to prevent shock. 
4.2	The Contractor shall ensure the system’s input can be connected to single end or differential feeds.
4.3	The Contractor shall provide adjustable positive or negative DC voltage injection.
4.4	The Contractor shall ensure the system is switch able AC or DC 600 ohm off hook loading.
4.5	The Contractor shall ensure the system’s gain is adjustable from 0 to 70 dB via a combination of analog and digital gain. 
4.6	The Contractor shall provide a headphone jack with adjustable output level and limiter function to prevent sudden output level changes.
4.7	The Contractor shall ensure the system has digital on-screen tone generation.
4.8	The Contractor shall ensure the system has a simple touch screen user interface to control all operations of the system.
4.9	The Contractor shall ensure the system has a large, clear on-screen indicators that will display the status of all functions.
4.10	The Contractor shall provide onboard high quality digital audio recording capacity of up to 60 minutes.
4.11	The Contractor shall ensure the system will operate for approximately 3 hours per battery charge.
4.12	The Contractor shall ensure the system will weigh under three pounds total.
4.13	The Contractor shall use separate rechargeable batteries for the computer 
and the I/O signal interface box.
4.14	The Contractor shall provide ambidextrous operation of the system.
4.15	The Contractor shall ensure that the development time does not exceed six 
            (6) months.
4.16	The Contractor shall ensure the system has the following system performance 
specifications (only fully applicable for the First Article system):
Hardware-Amplifier-Total Gain: Adjustable, 0 dB to 70 dB.  Bandwidth:                               20 Hz to 20 kHz (3 dB).  Input Impedance:  Selectable, 600 &#8486; and 1 M&#8486;.  Input Configuration:  Single ended (A or B) and Differential (A-B).  Common Mode Rejection:
80 dB @ 50/60 Hz and minimum 50 dB @ 2800 Hz.  Input Protection:  400 VDC, 240VAC protection.  Input Connectors:  Two 1/8 inch mono phone plugs marked A & B.
Headphone Output:  2-channel 1/8-inch phone plug (signal in both ears).  Headphone 
Overload Protection:  High speed limiting to protect hearing.  Output Impedance:  100
Ohms, AC coupled.

Line Driver- DC Output Voltage:  Adjustable 0 VDC to 18 VDC.  Output Current:  2 mA to 5 mA.  Line Polarity Reversing Switch: Included.

Software

1)	SES (Speech Extraction System) 4 based real-time technology modified for direct fingertip touch control operation.
2)	Full floating point operation for very high frequency and dynamic resolution.
	Record frequency domain events for utilization of an in-place monitoring system for the frequency range of the system. 
3)	Full Auto operation allows for a simple one-button solution to the repetitive task of cleaning live audio.
4)	Continuously adjustable band-pass, comb/notch filtering, harmonic notch filtering, automated tone detection and removal, and complex noise removal functions.
	
5.0	Security Requirements

Eventual production items (not a part of this PWS) including the dedicated touch-screen forensic audio software and the task-specific I/O hardware shell, will be available to US Government agencies, US law enforcement, and approved government and law enforcement agencies with the expressed written consent of the US Government. 

6.0	Deliverables

	The Contractor shall provide three (3) models – two (2) prototypes and one (1) first article, in a phased approach to allow for Government testing and feedback.  The phases are as follows:
	Phase I (prototype # 1) – Implementation of standard SES4 software onto the small portable handheld computer.
	Phase II (prototype # 2) – Implementation of application specific SES4 software with a rudimentary hardware interface.
	Phase III (first article) – Finished integrated amp and system. 

The Contractor shall provide three (3) user manuals and data reports associated with the system specifications cited in this PWS. 

7.0	Government Testing

	The Government (National Security Agency) technicians and the PFPA TSCM technicians will conduct all testing at the Interagency Training Center (ITC), 10530 Riverview Road, Ft Washington, MD 20744.  The test will consist of connecting the system to both telephone and power lines then detecting the audio that will be toned masked on those lines.  The testers will utilize the software to cancel out all injected tones and machine noise then record the audio.  The system will pass test if coherent audio can be recovered.
The testers will test the in-place monitoring capability of the system by producing a carrier current test signal to make sure the system registers the event.  The system will pass test if records event of the produced frequency.
The testers will utilize DC voltage injection to bias a microphone that requires between 4 and 18 volts DC that is polarity dependant to be activated.  The system passes if microphone is activated and passes audio. 
The Government will verify the PWS specifications to ensure the system meets requirements.  The system will pass first article testing and approval if all the testing requirements are met and passed.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STARDUST CLEANROOM - RFO# NNJ04060551Q: Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to the combined synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to address the following questions and associated answers. Questions and answers regarding the RFO# NNJ04060551Q are also posted on the Stardust Cleanroom Acquisition Website and can be located by accessing	   http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/scr/default.asp	     Questions and answers are numbered sequentially and are in congruence with the "Questions and Answers" posted on NAIS and the Stardust Cleanroom Acquistion Website.  Question 5: Item 14 of the Statement of Work (SOW) mentions unistrut support being provided by the “Construction Contractor.”  The vendor will need to coordinate with the “Construction Contractor” to make sure the support structure lines up with the cleanroom.  Will this coordination be feasible? Answer to Question 5: Yes.  After contract award, the cleanroom vendor will be able to work directly with the “Construction Contractor” on this issue. Question 6: Item 16 of the SOW calls for fluorescent lighting.  Typically fluorescent lighting is not dimmable.  Would other types of lighting be acceptable? Answer to Question 6: Inadvertently, item 16 of the Statement of Work (SOW) included "fluorescent lighting” as a requirement for the Stardust Cleanroom. To clarify, the lights must be cleanroom compatible and meet the illumination requirement in the SOW. Dimmable lighting is required.  The Stardust Cleanroom SOW is revised to state the above.  Question 7: Item 25 of the SOW discusses the lighting.  If a switch will be required inside the cleanroom to operate the outer room lights, coordination will be required with the “Construction Contractor.”  Will this coordination be feasible? Answer to Question 7: Yes.  After contract award, the cleanroom vendor will be able to work directly with the “Construction Contractor” to discuss the lighting and power tie-ins. Question 8: The “Construction Contractor’s” drawings show 277V panels.  Typically our equipment runs on 120V.  Is 277V equipment required? Answer to Question 8: 277V equipment is acceptable, but not required. Upon review of drawing GFD E-31-10, the “Construction Contractor” will provide two new electrical panels. One panel will run on 480/277V and the other panel will run on 208/120V. After contract award, the cleanroom vendor will be able to discuss these electrical matters with the “Construction Contractor” directly.   Question 9: Coordination will also be necessary for tying in the smoke detection system required in item 26 of the SOW.  Will the cleanroom vendor be able to coordinate on this matter with the “Construction Contractor”? Answer to Question 9: Yes. After contract award, the cleanroom vendor will be able to discuss these matters with the “Construction Contractor” directly.   Question 10: Item 27 of the SOW states a temperature and humidity requirement.  The SOW specifies a “temperature sensor.”  Does NASA require temperature control or a temperature monitor? Answer to Question 10: A temperature monitor.	The cleanroom vendor is not responsible for temperature control.  The “Construction Contractor” will provide air to the space and is responsible for monitoring and controlling that.  The cleanroom temperature sensor listed in the SOW is meant for monitoring only.  Since the cleanroom is not connected to the facility HVAC system, the cleanroom vendor cannot provide temperature control. Question 11: The RFO requests material samples because NASA is concerned about the materials inside the lab.  Are there any materials that I should avoid? Answer to Question 11: Avoid carbon steel because it is not a permitted material in any of the JSC curatorial cleanrooms.    REMINDER TO ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: All contractual and technical questions MUST be in writing (e-mail or fax) to Seena K. Mathews, Contract Specialist, email address: seena.k.mathews@nasa.gov ; fax number: 281-483-4066, OR Kelly R. Wilcutt, Contracting Officer, email address: kelly.r.wilcutt@nasa.gov ; fax number: 281-483-4173, not later than May 12, 2004. Telephone questions will not be accepted. Please do not call or write(email or fax) the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. This reminder is issued in order to protect the integrity of the procurement process. Thank you.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 15, 2004. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet. These documents reside on a World Wide Web(WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
