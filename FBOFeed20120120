<DESC><p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates posting a solicitation for proposals for a six and one-half (6.5) year (base period with seven extension options) performance based cost plus award fee contract for the maintenance and fielding of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Support - Household Component (HC) which will include collecting, editing, and imputing data collected from households. The Contractor will also be responsible for survey weight and estimation variable development and construction as well as analytic file development, including documentation and code books.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-HC which collects detailed information on health care use and payment for health care services from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. In the MEPS HC, data are collected for each new sample (panel) of households to cover a two-year period, and a new panel is started each year. To produce health care estimates for a calendar year, data are combined across two distinct nationally representative MEPS HC samples. More specifically, annual estimates are based on data from the first year of a current panel combined with data from the second year of a previous year's panel.</p>
<p><br />The primary objective of the MEPS HC is to provide high quality data that can be used to produce both point estimates as well as distributional estimates of health care use, medical expenditures, health insurance status and sources of payment for medical care. In addition, the MEPS HC is designed to produce measures of health care quality associated with several high prevalence conditions. The health care services use, medical expenditures, and health insurance data can also be linked to the demographic, employment, economic, and health status of survey participants. The longitudinal feature of the MEPS HC permits analyses of transitions in health insurance coverage, health status, and other characteristics over a two year period.</p>
<p>The MEPS-HC is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection (computer assisted and paper questionnaires) from household respondents of demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and sources of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment information. In addition, staff will have expertise and experience in developing analytic files, including documentation of public use files, as well as survey weight and variance estimation development and construction, and analytical and statistical data editing and imputation.</p>

The period of performance for this contract is a 6-month base period (1 Apr 12 - 30 Sep 12) and one 6-month option period (1 Oct 12 - 31 Mar 13). The period of performance must start on 1 Apr 12. This short-term contract is needed to provide uninterrupted services while a new 4-year contract is being re-procured competitively. <br />FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, is the appropriate authority for this action . No other authorities in FAR 6.302 are appropriate. If we fail to award this contract under this authority, it may have broader implications for Air Force missions and we may have second and third order effects. The agency intends this action as a temporary measure not anticipated to exceed one year to meet the Air Force mission of feeding military trainees. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK:<br />Non-personal services to provide full food service at 14 dining facilities and one flight kitchen at Lackland AFB, the Lackland Training Annex, Camp Bullis (approximately 30 miles northwest from Lackland AFB) and maintain one Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) warehouse.

Approximately 710,000 meals are served monthly. It is essential to the public interest that feeding of personnel continue at Lackland AFB without any gaps in service. Adequate sources do not exist in-house to provide these services. <br /><br />All firms or individuals responding to this notice must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website. <strong>HOWEVER, NOTE THAT 34 CFR 395.33(D) AUTHORIZES THE AGENCY TO ENTER INTO DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH THE DESIGNATED BLIND VENDOR IN LIEU OF COMPETITION.</strong></p>

The system will monitor and control outside air ventilation, lighting systems, electrical heat tracing on water and sewage lines, interior and exterior steam traps, building temperatures, and heating water temperatures. Control action will be limited to selected facilities and include a central control station, substations, fiber optic communications net, field interface devices, and necessary mechanical and electrical modifications to existing equipment. The facilities at Thule Air Base do not benefit from available modern technology for monitoring and control. Excessive repair costs are incurred when buildings in unoccupied periods freeze up unnoticed due to heating system failure or when water and sewage lines freeze up due to failing electrical heat tracing. During unoccupied periods, energy is wasted unnecessarily in buildings for outside air ventilation, lighting, and heating. Energy is lost unnoticed through failing steam traps in spite of excessive Recurring Work Program costs to maintain the traps. An excessive amount of energy is wasted from overheated buildings due to deficient temperature controls.</span></p>

ET 02-20	AUTHORIZED WORKERS NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CONTRACTORS	SEPTEMBER 2002
(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:  http://www.uscis.gov/i-9
(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
	(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
	(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
	(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings
I.3	52.222-42	STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES	                     MAY 1989
In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4), this clause identifies the classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract and states the wages and fringe benefits payable to each if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332.

NOTIFICATION TO ALL CONTRACTORS	Notification to all Contractors
The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security.  Each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised.
Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents.  To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority.  Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information."  Although the Department has taken steps to secure access to publicly published classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard. 
Contractors therefore are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of non-classified government information technology systems:
Except as authorized by their agencies and pursuant to agency procedures, contractors shall not, while using Government issued computers or other devices (such as Blackberries or Smart Phones) access the web on non-classified Government systems, access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto non-classified systems.  This requirement applies to access that occurs either through agency or contractor computers, or through employees' or contractors' personally owned computers that access non-classified Government systems.  This requirement does not restrict contractor access to non-classified, publicly available news reports (and other non-classified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as distinguished from access to underlying documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are available on public Web sites or otherwise in the public domain).
Contractors shall not access classified material unless a favorable determination of the person's eligibility for access has been made by an agency head or the agency head's designee, the person has signed and approved non-disclosure agreement, the person has a need to know the information, and the person has received contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
Classified information shall not be removed from official premises or disclosed without proper authorization.
Contractors who believe they may have inadvertently accessed or downloaded classified or sensitive information on computers that access the web via non-classified government systems, or without prior authorization, should contact their Contracting Officer immediately.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your vigilance to these responsibilities.  If you have any questions regarding handling classified documents, or the blocking of access to sites which have inappropriately posted classified materials, please contact your Contracting Officer.  It will be the Contracting Officer's responsibility to contact the appropriate Government personnel regarding these matters.

Taxpayer Identification Number:  ____________________________

ET 02-20	AUTHORIZED WORKERS NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CONTRACTORS	SEPTEMBER 2002
(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:  http://www.uscis.gov/i-9
(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
	(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
	(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
	(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings

NOTIFICATION TO ALL CONTRACTORS	The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security.  Each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised.
Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents.  To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority.  Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information."  Although the Department has taken steps to secure access to publicly published classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard. 
Contractors therefore are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of non-classified government information technology systems:
Except as authorized by their agencies and pursuant to agency procedures, contractors shall not, while using Government issued computers or other devices (such as Blackberries or Smart Phones) access the web on non-classified Government systems, access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto non-classified systems.  This requirement applies to access that occurs either through agency or contractor computers, or through employees' or contractors' personally owned computers that access non-classified Government systems.  This requirement does not restrict contractor access to non-classified, publicly available news reports (and other non-classified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as distinguished from access to underlying documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are available on public Web sites or otherwise in the public domain).
Contractors shall not access classified material unless a favorable determination of the person's eligibility for access has been made by an agency head or the agency head's designee, the person has signed and approved non-disclosure agreement, the person has a need to know the information, and the person has received contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
Classified information shall not be removed from official premises or disclosed without proper authorization.
Contractors who believe they may have inadvertently accessed or downloaded classified or sensitive information on computers that access the web via non-classified government systems, or without prior authorization, should contact their Contracting Officer immediately.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your vigilance to these responsibilities.  If you have any questions regarding handling classified documents, or the blocking of access to sites which have inappropriately posted classified materials, please contact your Contracting Officer.  It will be the Contracting Officer's responsibility to contact the appropriate Government personnel regarding these matters.
GP-20	TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION AND DATA UNIVERSAL NUMBERING SYSTEM	              JANUARY 2005
The contractor shall submit with their offer the following information:
Taxpayer Identification Number:  ____________________________
Data Universal Numbering System:  __________________________

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) intends to award a sole source contract to USEC, Inc. (USEC) for separative work units (SWU), which is the measure of enrichment services, to enrich natural uranium to low-enriched uranium (LEU) to be used for DOE's tritium program.

The delivery schedule will be within 3 months of contract award.
USEC is uniquely qualified to provide DOE with these enrichment goods in the form of SWU because it is the only provider of SWU that uses U.S.-origin technology, the only current enrichment technology available to DOE that is free of peaceful use assurances.  For defense and DOE programmatic purposes, DOE needs LEU that is unencumbered by peaceful use assurances and thus can be used for defense purposes.  
In accordance with 41 U.S.C. ? 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.

Interested parties may submit a capability statement by February 6, 2012 at 2:00 pm local prevailing time (Washington, D.C.) via e-mail to matthew.parker@hq.doe.gov.  The written response must include a detailed discussion demonstrating the ability to provide low-enriched uranium unencumbered by peaceful use assurances and past performance client information for like deliveries.  
Questions regarding this notice are to be submitted via email to matthew.parker@hq.doe.gov by January 26, 2012 at 8:00 am local prevailing time (Washington, D.C.).  Questions received after this date and time will not be addressed.

The IFB will be available under the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site at www.fbo.gov. The Government will not issue a hard copy of the IFB. All interested vendors must obtain the solicitation documents via the FBO web portal.</p>
<p>The IFB will require interested vendors to provide bid samples that meet or exceed the salient characteristics as specified in the statement of work. These samples will be evaluated by the Governments Technical Evaluation Committee and only those vendors whose bid samples are determined to meet or exceed all of the salient characteristics contained in the IFB will be invited to participate in an online reverse auction. In the event a vendor's bid sample fails to satisfy all of the salient requirements, the vendor's bid will be determined non-responsive and shall be eliminated for further consideration.</p>
<p>A reverse auction is a pricing mechanism used by the federal government. The reverse auction will be conducted by a firm that specializes in facilitating reverse auctions. Those vendors who are invited to participate in the reverse auction are then contacted by an enabler who the Government has contracted with to facilitate the reverse auction. The enabler ensures that the vendor's computer equipment is sufficient and then trains each vendor how to participate in the reverse auction. A mock auction shall be is held the day before the actual auction to assure that all participants are fully familiar with the procedures. The enabler shall address all technical questions concerning the reverse auction.</p>
<p>During the auction, the government sets a maximum price to start the bidding. Vendors place their bids electronically and are able to see the current lowest bid. Vendors continue to place lower and lower bids throughout the auction. Vendors will not know the name of the Vendor who has placed a bid but will only see the bid itself.</p>
<p>The date and time of the reverse auction will be made available as part of the IFB. The auction will continue until such time that the bidding stops and a final price is determined. The winning bid will be the lowest overall price for the specified linens and quantities.<br />Any question concerning this pre-solicitation should be submitted via email to the attention of the contract specialist Mr. Brian Lind at lindbj@cc.nih.gov.</p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to IRIX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. located at 101 Technology Pl, Florence, SC 29501, for the acquisition of up to 8KG of the experimental drug (3-Amino-propyl)-butyl-phosphinic acid (SGS 742) under cGMP conditions for the clinical trial in children suffering from succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency disease.</p>
<p>The mission of NINDS Clinical Epilepsy Section is to perform research to improve the treatment of people with intractable epilepsy. NINDS intends to continue clinical trials in treating patients with SSADH, which is a severe pediatric neurotransmitter disorder causing seizures, neurological deficits, and developmental delay. At present, there is no proven treatment for the disease, but studies in experimental animals have suggested that SGS-742 may be beneficial. Further, in previous clinical trials in patients with mild cognitive impairment, SGS-742 significantly improved attention, as well as working memory. Rights to use SGS-742 in the NINDS SSADH deficiency clinical trial have since been transferred to NIH from the previous rights holder. The trial itself will be a double-blind cross-over trial in which patients will receive active drug for one period and a placebo for the second period. Drug encapsulation and blinding will be performed with placebo supplied by the NIH Clinical Center Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Irix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the only known source that can produce SGS-742 in sufficient quantities required by the NINDS research trial in cGMP conditions, which makes the drug suitable for use in human clinical trials. Any other manufacturers would have to undergo an independent evaluation to meet human clinical trial standards that would delay drug acquisition and trial initiation, thereby causing an adverse effect on the health of children with SSADH deficiency.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2411107, may be submitted to the NIDA SS/SA Branch electronically to the attention of Hunter A. Tjugum, at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>PROJECT: New United States Courthouse - Los Angeles, California<br />BUILDING TYPE: Courthouse and Federal Office Building<br />SIZE: 600,000 GSF<br />PARKING SPACES: 110 Controlled-Access Structured Parking <br />BUDGET: ECCA $322,000,000<br />GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: State of California<br />SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: None</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS) seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, engineers, and construction professionals to design and construct federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, durability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design and Construction services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, security requirements, and achieve at least a LEED Gold certification. This facility will be designed in English units.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for a negotiated Design-Build (DB) construction contract for the new United States Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA. This acquisition encompasses the design and construction of the offices and related space (courtrooms, chambers and other special use space) as required for the U.S. District Court; U.S. Marshals Service; GSA field office; Department of Homeland Security - Federal Protective Service; and trial preparation space for the Office of the U.S. Attorney, and the Federal Public Defender. The facility includes 110 controlled-access, non-public parking spaces inside the completed structure. The newly constructed courthouse shall be located on GSA owned property, on a site between Broadway, Hill, First and Second Streets in the Civic Center area of downtown Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>The total space requirement consists of approximately 600,000 gross square feet, available for use by the federal government for personnel, furnishings and equipment no later than March 2016. The building will be designed and constructed in English units. The estimated total design/build cost is between $312,000,000 and $322,000,000 with occupancy planned for the year 2016. The scope of required Design/Build Services may include, but not be limited to, the following: design/construction documents and construction work, which consists of providing all labor, equipment, and materials for a complete build-out of the Federal Courthouse. The facility will have substantial electrical and HVAC requirements.</p>
<p>The selection process will utilize the Best Value Tradeoff process as stipulated within the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures in Subpart 36.3 of the FAR. This project is an opportunity in Design and Construction Excellence that must integrate the building into the fabric of the surrounding community and create a new Federal landmark in the heart of Los Angeles that represents the dignity of the U.S. Government. The courthouse must express solemnity, integrity, rigor and fairness.</p>
<p>The selection process will include two phases: <br />&bull; Phase I, the Request For Qualifications (RFQ) leading to selecting a short list of 3 Design-Build offerors, who will be invited to participate in:<br />&bull; Phase II, the comprehensive Request for Proposal (RFP) competition and selection of the design/build offeror.</p>
<p>A single, firm, fixed-price contract with award fee may be awarded for all design beyond a program of requirements and all construction services. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards. In consideration for the preparation of the Phase II proposal, GSA will pay a stipend to the two non-selected offerors.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7, as part of its proposal.</p>
<p>Consideration is open to established, qualified firms licensed to perform professional services (FAR 22.1102 and 22.1103), which currently have active, properly staffed offices within the continental United States (including subcontractors).</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about February 6, 2012 on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference is scheduled:</p>
<p>Date: February 22, 2012</p>
<p>Time: 1:00 p.m. PST</p>
<p>Location: 312 N. Spring St.<br />Los Angeles, CA 90012-4701</p>
<p>Interested attendees are encouraged to register their company with the GSA contacts listed below via email by February 10, 2012, for all individuals who plan to attend in person. There will be no call-in reservations accepted. This briefing is intended to review the scope of the project, submittal requirements and review the project site.</p>

<DESC>All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address:  Charlotte.R.Harris.@usace.army.mil.  This Acquisition shall be competed as 8(a) in the SBA Servicing Office area of REGION 6 (Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, & Arkansas).  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.   Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with twelve-month base periods plus four twelve-month option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for construction services with an estimated workload value of $140 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <br><br>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.<br><br><br><br><br><br>.  <br><br><br>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction activities such as new construction, renovation, repairs, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and erosion control, earthwork and operations construction activities as applicable under these MATOCs.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <br><br>The Fort Worth District intends to award up to five contracts as 8(a) within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $15 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3000.  In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider - 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <br><br>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <br><br>After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors' proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the project-lump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br><br>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5.  <br><br>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

<a href="mailto:stephen.m.yoder@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Portland</a>
<DESC>Description<br>The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District (USACE-Portland) seeks Application Engineering information for the design of a fire detection system which will provide early detection of a fire in hydroelectric powerhouses. The system will be based upon National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes, recently completed Fire Hazards Analyses (FHA) and Life Safety Assessments (LSA), and the project Design Basis report. Specifically the design will include:<br><br>a.   Fire Alarm Control Unit (FACU).<br>b.   Fire Alarm Annunciator (FAA).<br>c.   Remote monitor in the control room.<br>d.   Photoelectric Light Scattering Spot Smoke Detection.<br>e.   Aspirating Smoke Detection (ASD).<br>f.    Manual Fire Alarm Pull Stations<br>g.   Interface modules to existing systems<br><br>This request is to acquire manufacturers input on designs which will be incorporated into the performance specifications for future fire protection contract(s). <br><br>1.	BACKGROUND.  <br><br>Portland District Corps of Engineers, USACE- Portland, operates 20 dams in the states of Oregon and Washington.  The 3 largest are on the Columbia River: Bonneville (2 powerhouses), The Dalles, and John Day. 13 are in the Willamette Valley (Detroit and Big Cliff on North Santiam; Green Peter and Foster on the South Santiam; Cougar and Blue River on the McKenzie; Lookout Point, Dexter, Fall Creek, and Hills Creek on the Middle Fork of the Willamette; Dorena and Cottage Grove on the Coastal Fork of the Willamette; and Fern Ridge on the Long Tom River west of Eugene, Oregon); 2 are in the Rogue River Valley (Lookout Point and Applegate); Willow Creek  at Heppner in North Central Oregon; and the SRS on the North Toutle River next to Mt. St. Helens.  13 of these 20 dams have hydropower with powerhouses.   <br><br>This procurement is to improve the fire suppression and alarm systems, eventually, at all of these powerhouses. Currently, this upgrade is a multi-phased fire and life safety upgrade to four (4) powerhouses on the Columbia River, Bonneville 1 and 2, The Dalles, and John Day. Each will undergo control room egress and smoke control pressurization upgrades as the first phase, labeled as Phase A, of upgrading the fire protection. Phase A will include limited area detection and fire alarm control panel installation.  The phased approach will continue with a Phase B expansion of the fire alarm system to include notification appliances and additional egress components, as well as eventually add active and passive fire suppression, based upon Fire Hazards Analysis and Life Safety Assessment (FHA/LSA) reports for each location.  Phase A is defined as the initial installation in the Columbia River hydroelectric projects and is estimated to take approximately three (3) years to complete.  It must be recognized in the design and during the installation process that this phasing requires integration, as well as the flexibility to adapt to ongoing changes in the operating environment or to advances in fire protection technology.  <br><br>Due to the complexity of the design in a program covering multiple years and multiple projects the design team seeks to evaluate and compare manufacturers and products. USACE intends to select one manufacturer whose components will be installed throughout USACE - Portland. The design team understands that each Manufacturer has products which have proprietary information. The specific product and system must be provided to allow comparison of the entire system being installed to determine the engineering tradeoffs, benefits and issues for each manufacturer. <br><br>There are many issues for the design team that will not be satisfactorily addressed without the information requested. The design team plans to use performance-based specifications but needs be able to compare product specific and proprietary information from each manufacturer. The conceptual schematics which are frequently used in the industry to convey general design parameters in performance-based specification can result in a high degree of variability during the bidding process and frequently leads to change order requests and cost over-runs of the original budget.  The development by the project engineering team of definitive fire alarm drawings presents a separate set of practical difficulties, since it requires the initial designer to select a "surrogate" manufacturer's system.  This basis often results in a design that is not the one actually selected in the competitive bid process and which is likely not to be representative of the actual means and methods needed to execute the project, based upon the successful bidder's own selection of manufacturer's product line.  The result is time and expense for a design which is seldom, if ever used in the actual installation phase. Most importantly, it removes the potential for the manufacturer to leverage their product to meet the functional and operating parameters critical to the end-user. Since fire alarm design is dependent upon applications of devices and methods proprietary to specific manufacturers that must be integrated into a single NFPA 72 compliant and nationally recognized testing laboratory listed or approved system, it is not possible to develop a wholly descriptive "generic design" from which to have prospective bidders provide installation proposals. <br><br>The design team has determined that Phase A must be capable of facilitating incorporation of upgrades from future phases through planned expansion capability of the selected equipment as well as minimize the need for demolition of completed items from earlier phases.<br>The Portland district has developed a strategic plan and identified specific tasks for completion during Phase A.  Phase A is first and foremost a life safety upgrade intended to increase the tenability of the control room during a fire in order to facilitate the operators' ability to safely shutdown the impacted powerhouse systems and provide safe egress route for the operators and facility staff to the outside of the plant.  The principal features intended to meet this goal for Phase A include:<br><br>a.	Provide early warning to the Control Room of a fire situation via general area fire detection and direct notification to the Control Room only.  This shall facilitate a safe shutdown of the power generating equipment and control room evacuation.  <br>b.	Reinforce the fire/smoke resistance of the Control Room, providing to the extent practicable, two (2) hour separation and smoke resistant firestopping and penetration seals throughout the established compartment. The detection system will also activate a smoke control pressurization system to retain tenability of the control room environment and facilitate safe egress.  Tenability of the control room shall be based upon a minimum thirty (30) minute assumed period for operator coordinated remote safe shutdown of major equipment systems and ninety minutes of protected egress.<br>c.	Provide a pressurized enclosed fire/smoke protected means of egress from the Control Room of two (2) hour rated construction. The egress path will be pressurized by a signal from the FACU.<br>d.	Provide foundation for future fire/life safety phased upgrades in order to minimize the need to replace newly installed components and to accommodate expandability particularly for the fire detection system. The new detection system will provide detection and alarm in the control room per the Design Basis. Future upgrades will provide additional detection and annunciation throughout the powerhouse. Future expansion of the system will require minimal changes or replacement to accommodate expanded detection and alarm functions.<br><br><br><br>2.	OBJECTIVES.  The first step USACE-Portland seeks to select a Manufacturer design of the fire protection and life safety systems at Bonneville Powerhouse 1. Manufacturers shall provide complete design information of the manufacturers most suitable fire detection system including a FACU and detectors as noted in the Design Basis and other documentation. The design shall include, but is not limited to:<br><br>a.	Drawings showing location and arrangement of all components in accordance with NFPA 72 requirements.<br>b.	Detailed design of FACU showing components and layout. <br>c.	All details of the personal computer interface shall be provided with LCD monitor and tilt-out keyboard/mouse interface in a new cabinet adjacent to the existing security control console.

<DESC>U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) anticipates contracting on a sole source basis with Honeywell International Inc., 1300 West Warner Road, Tempe, AZ, on an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, for Life Cycle Contractor Support to sustain peculiar and close loop Honeywell systems installed on the aircraft for the U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (ARSOAC). The proposed action is for services for which the Government does not own specifications and drawings, thus making full and open competition impracticable if not impossible, due to the expense of acquiring the rights to this data, even if the owners of the data were willing to sell the rights to the technical data. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority FAR 6.302-1. Firms that feel they can provide this service are encouraged to identify themselves. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal, however, the Government will consider all proposals received by the specified due date (in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)). A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government. The estimated release date of the solicitation is around late April/May 2012. The initial period of performance shall be for 12 months from date of award, with five (5)-one (1) year ordering periods.

<DESC>Positive Control Subsystem (PCSS) Request for Information (RFI)
<p>I. DESCRIPTION / PURPOSE:</p>
<p>1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) / Spacelift Range System Division (LRR) Program Office (PO) has identified the need to implement the EFTS to comply with the NSA Advisory (IAA-004-2007). This direction ceases production of the High Alphabet Secure Flight Termination System (HA SFTS) required on Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) by 1 January 2015. It also directs users to migrate to EFTS by the same date.</p>
<p>2. The goals of the PCSS project are to (1) address the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) mandate by National Security Agency (NSA), (2) replace a legacy worst-actor, Eastern Range (ER) Central Command Remoting System (CCRS) and (3) modernize both the ER and Western Range (WR) command systems. The WR implementation of the PCSS program should maintain commonality with the ER solution.</p>
<p>3. The EFTS has been developed to support missions that require a flight termination system. The EFTS uses encryption and command authentication to assure only valid commands are executed by the launch vehicle(s). These commands are performed through Central Command on the ER, at the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) at Patrick Air Force Base (AFB) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (AFS), and on the WR, at the 30th Space Wing (30 SW) at Vandenberg AFB and Pillar Point AFS.</p>
<p>4. The EFTS allows configurable mission support while providing a secure and reliable communications link. The EFTS uses a digital frequency modulated (FM) based technique known as continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) along with signal encryption and authentication to provide a secure and reliable pathway for the purpose of vehicle control (e.g. flight termination) in order to protect the public from malfunctioning vehicles. The EFTS has five main components: Flight Termination Receiver (FTR), Encoder, Monitor, Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) Unit (TDU), and Command Controller. These EFTS end-items are intended for three applications: Missile, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and Space Launch.</p>
<p>5. The PCSS program will leverage an Engineering Development Model (EDM) developed by WV Communications (WV) to integrate and support the continued development of the equipment. The EDM was completed during the CCRS Replacement Phase I project. The associated hardware and software are proprietary to WV. The ER CCRS Phase II project is currently in-progress and will deliver a Critical Design Review (CDR) package that will be provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI) to the program.</p>
<p>6. Qualified sources are requested to submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience and capability in the task areas listed below. Response from small and small disadvantaged firms is encouraged. Additionally, if teaming with other contractors, provide the name(s) and role(s) of the contractors. The SOC review will look at the capabilities to perform the task and will not preclude any offeror from submitting a proposal.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought - Planned Sole Source Follow-on Contract for Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel (NSCM) Overarching Research and Evaluation Program (OREP) Support<br><br>The Office of the Project Manager for NSCM has the mission responsibility, as mandated by Public Law 102-484, for the disposal of all applicable Department of Defense chemical warfare materiel (CWM) in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.  To facilitate this mission, NSCM has developed an extensive OREP program for performing multiple evaluations/engineering studies on various technologies that may be potentially suitable for analyzing or treating CWM in an environmentally acceptable manner.   This planned follow-on contract action is for acquiring the continuation of the ongoing contractor support under the NSCM OREP program.  As contained in the corresponding statement of work (SOW), it will require the contractor to perform specified evaluations/studies on various technologies, involving both commercial vendors and government laboratories, suitable for analyzing or treating NSCM CWM.   It will also require the contractor to design and oversee specified testing to validate their engineering assumptions and the system's performance.  Finally, it will require the contractor to provide conceptual and detailed designs for prototypical fieldable systems based on the laboratory and subscale tests and to fabricate and validate the design through operational testing.  The standard method for conducting these evaluations will be based on a multiple phase approach, starting with a proof of concept through possible fabrication and fielding as determined by the earlier phase results.  Currently, the projected overall period of performance will be 36 months; this planned follow-on contract action will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract type and will be funded primarily with Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation funding.<br><br>As described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), the above unique and/or highly specialized services being planned are available only from the original source; this planned follow-on contract action will be to the current OREP contractor, Shaw Environmental, Inc. (Shaw), Stoughton, MA.  The Government has determined that procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because procurement from any other source than Shaw would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or would potentially cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the NSCM's OREP requirements.  This planned follow-on contract will allow NSCM to retain these unique and/or highly specialized scientific, technical, and/or engineering services in supporting of its OREP requirements for its ongoing and future missions/activities without a disruption to these services.  This planned follow-on contract has to be in place no later than 8 Dec 2012 to provide the continuation of the NSCM OREP support without a break of these services.<br><br>Over the last ten years and as the only OREP performer under its applicable Program and Integration Support (PAIS) and Non-Stockpile Systems Contract II (NSSCII) task order(s), Shaw successfully provided the OREP support  This included the management of the Technical Evaluation Panels (TEP) I, II, III, and IV groups for NSCM and the preparation of NSCM the Overarching Research Plan (ORP) and Overarching Research and Evaluation Plan, which identified all the current, near term and long-term technology requirements needed to fulfill the NSCM mission.  From those needs assessments, Shaw developed the formats for the technology evaluation plans with acceptance criteria, test plans, quality assurance requirements, health & safety formats, test report formats and independent evaluation reports. Under its previous task orders, Shaw has reviewed over one-hundred technologies with potential applicability to NSCM analytical, CWM destruction, and other needs identified in the ORP.  Further, Shaw has overseen the testing and evaluation of the ten technologies down-selected to date from their initial evaluations and three non-intrusive analyzer system evaluations.  Shaw was responsible for extensive and complex reporting on these evaluations.  This planned follow-on contract action will extend, leverage, and build upon Shaw's prior evaluation efforts under its PAIS and NSSCII task orders.   Accordingly, this planned follow-on OREP contract action to Shaw represents the logical continuation of previous expended activities/efforts, lessons learned, and costs to ensure that the unique and/or highly specialized scientific, technical, and/or engineering services required by the corresponding SOW are available from Shaw in a timely and efficient manner without causing significant delays and cost impacts to the NSCM OREP projects/activities.<br><br>The purpose of this special notice is to conduct a market survey of interested parties that may have capabilities and past experiences to respond to and comply with the overall above NSCM OREP requirements or submit proposals if a future competitive NSCM OREP request for proposal is issued.  Please submit your interest in response to this sources sought notice, and a description of your capabilities and past experiences to perform the above NSCM OREP objectives and requirements.  This description and past experiences should discuss performing multiple evaluations/engineering studies on various technologies, involving both commercial vendors and government laboratories, that may be potentially suitable for analyzing or treating CWM in an environmentally acceptable manner.   In addition, your description should provide the company name(s) of your prospective Contractor team arrangement.  Your response shall be emailed to Mr. Jeff Decker at address:  jeffrey.j.decker2.civ@mail.mil; his phone number is 309-782-5406.  As such, the email submission should be as a Word file attachment, Times New Roman (12 pitch), of no more than five (5) pages (11x8.5).  Responses are requested no later than 21 Feb 2012.<br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all information received within thirty days after the date of publication of this sources sought notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the planning purpose of determining whether to conduct a follow-on NSCM OREP competitive acquisition.<br>

Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p><br />III. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is requesting information on potential sources to cooperatively develop and use an in situ water analyzer that can be applied to surface water to detect at the species level for the presence (and absence) of  Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels).  The specific area of interest and minimum baseline performance for the in situ water analyzer are listed below.
Area of Interest.  Reclamation is interested in the development and use of an in situ water analyzer that can be applied to surface water (e.g., Reclamation reservoirs) to selectively and sensitively detect for the presence (and absence) of two Dreissena spp., zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), at the earliest possible stage of infestation.  Early detection of these invasive bivalve species makes it more possible for Reclamation to take certain steps to slow down their spread to neighboring water bodies and implement control measures for the protection of our water delivery infrastructures.  Currently, detection of mussel veligers is accomplished using plankton tow net sampling and returning the water samples to Reclamation's laboratories where they are analyzed  using cross-polarized microscopy, PCR, and scanning electron microscopy.
Minimum Baseline Performance.  The minimum baseline performance for such an analyzer to be cooperatively developed must meet or exceed current capabilities being used by Reclamation, including:
a.	Entire process from water sampling to final data recording must be accomplished on site (e.g., in situ at Reclamation reservoirs), without requiring an on-going human operator to be present.b.	Tests of samples of naturally-occurring plankton from surface water with sample volumes greater than 1,000 liters per site per month (typical of current Reclamation monitoring programs), without requiring sample preservation or sample holding prior to detection (as currently performed in Reclamation monitoring programs).c.	No additional labor cost per unit sample.  Reclamation's current cost estimate is $350 per unit sample, which includes sampling and laboratory testing.d.	Total turnaround time for a single sample from sampling to final data reporting must be accomplished on site faster than current Reclamation practice of collecting a sample and returning sample for laboratory testing (typically 1 - 2 weeks from field sampling to laboratory report). e.	Tests of samples must be able to detect sizes of Dreissinid veligers ranging from 100 microns to 500 microns.f.	Level of detection selectivity must be species-specific for both zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), without requiring human operator assessment and without any cross interferences between zebra mussel, quagga mussel, or other common plankton species (i.e., ostracods and Asiatic clams).g.	Instrument detection limit is 1 veliger (absolute scale), equivilant to current Reclamation laboratory methods utilizing microscopy and PCR.h.	Probability of capturing veligers in situ must match or better current Reclamation monthly sampling of 1,000 liters concentrated to 50 milliliters during plankton tow sampling (20,000 fold concentration factor).  i.	Species-specific detection must have an absent/present accuracy rate equal or greater than current DNA-based PCR methods (75.8%), with less than 18.2% false negative and 6.1% false positive error rates. j.	Species-specific detection for both zebra and quagga mussels must be simultaneous, without requiring separate sample processing.  k.	Water analyzer must be flexible enough to allow for simultaneous species-specific detection of possible future addition of other target species, such as other sessile, epibyssate, veliger-producing freshwater mussels (e.g., Limnoperna fortunei, aka golden mussel which is a Neotropical invader).l.	Species-specific detection must allow for in situ determination of absence or presence (e.g., the minimum threshold for presence must be well defined).    m.	At a minimum, water analyzer must provide a record of time of sample collection, volume of water sampled, absence/presence of zebra and quagga mussels, and raw signal levels.  n.	Water analyzer must be transportable using regular government vehicles (car or truck) or common courier services such as FEDEX, UPS, or DHL.o.	Operation of the water analyzer must be shown to be safe to the environment and human health.
In the past 5 years, Reclamation has sponsored and conducted significant research in the development of new laboratory analytical methods for the detection of zebra and quagga mussels, including DNA-based PCR and antibody-based immunofluorescence detection.  While these new analytical methods are at the research level, this effort has demonstrated the potential of molecular methods to selectively and sensitively detect for the presence of zebra and quagga mussels.  Reclamation seeks to apply these molecular-based methods to further improve our capability to monitor for zebra and quagga mussels.  
Reclamation organized and sponsored a 1 ?-day workshop in January, 2009 to further explore current zebra and quagga mussel detection methods and controls.  The proceedings from this workshop are available at: http://www.musselmonitoring.com/Mussel_Monitoring_Workshop_Report%20v3%20(FINAL).pdf In addition, Reclamation and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services have sponsored an ongoing Round Robin Study, including a community double-blind testing of currently available laboratory methods (cross polarized light microscopy, imaging flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction assays).  This double-blind testing was phase II of the Round Robin Study and was completed in February 2011.  The information most relevant to this business opportunity notice is the accuracy rate reported for current DNA-based PCR methods (75.8%), with an 18.2% false negative and 6.1% false positive error rates.  The results from the second phase of this Round Robin study are being submitted for publication, but the initial report can be found at:
http://www.musselmonitoring.com/Reports/RRII%20Final%20Report%20(2010).pdf 
This request is to gather information from interested parties and is deemed essential as part of our collaborative, deliberate planning process for future acquisition planning if the information submitted indicates a strong commercial capability exists for Reclamation's intended applications or for research and development efforts with qualified industry representative(s) to develop and commercialize the capability sought.

<DESC>THIS IS AN ANNOUNCMENT FOR AN INDUSTRY DAY TO PERFORM MARKET RESEARCH PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISTION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information solicited or provided as a result of this notice. The result of the market research process may be used, however, to develop the scope for potential future RFPs. This is not a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP nor pay any proposal or proposal preparation costs.
<p>The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an Industry Day participant for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts, data offered for examination, or any other expense associated with attendance.</p>
<p>The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) Contracting Directorate is hosting an Industry Day on 3 February 2012 at 9:00 (EST) on Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. All information presented during this event will be UNCLASSIFIED. The Industry Day will allow the AFDW to determine the range, scope, capabilities and capacity of potential commercial partners to include small businesses to support future Air Force National Capital Region Information Technology (AFNCR IT) Services.

NHTSA developed the ARIDE curriculum as an alternate, shorter-term course that was designed to assist officers in their arrest decisions, to enable them to speak more confidently in court settings about those decisions, and to aid in their judgment to call DEC-trained officers to perform Drug Recognition Evaluations (DRE).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">NHTSA has received several directives regarding training law enforcement officers to identify DUID (the most recent, the Office of National Drug Control Policy's strategy <a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><span><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span></span></span></span></a> for preventing drugged driving).

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">For many types of courses, NHTSA will hear that the training was a "success" because hundreds of students were trained, or because a certain number of students passed the test with a "high" score. However, neither of these explanations is sufficient to inform us as to what the students learned, whether, and for how long, they will retain the knowledge, and how they will use that information. NHTSA is interested in implementing strong and pertinent curricula, and conducting solid evaluations of those courses that can help teach individuals (in this case, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and other traffic safety professionals) in a cost-effective manner, about recognition of drug and alcohol impairment. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the ARIDE curriculum, as it is currently delivered, and assess the overall effectiveness of linking the objectives to the course materials, and how the objectives contribute to enhancing the officers' skill at making informed arrest decisions at the roadside.</span></p>

<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAVAIR Lakehurst's USMC Expeditionary Airfield Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking integrated solutions to supply materials, tools and equipment for the management and operation of US Marine Corps expeditionary airfields located throughout world in current and future Areas Of Responsibility (AOR)'s. This initiative will also support Contingency Operations, Training, Exercises, and Humanitarian Relief efforts in the US and throughout the AOR's. The objective for this initiative is supporting the customer by ensuring reduced cycle times, achieving the best pricing available utilizing commercial business practices, and structuring processes to ensure maximum oversight, reducing administrative burden and increasing customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INITIATIVE OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Sustainment Lighting Program is one of the four systems of USMC Expeditionary Airfields supporting the forward deployed Marine. The Government is requesting input from industry, to determine the potential for a Long Term Contract in support of the Marine Corps expeditionary airfield operations, specifically the SLP.</p>

<DESC>The Request for Information (RFI) is posted as a follow on to RFI N68335-12-RFI-7100.
<p>This RFI is identical to N68335-12-RFI-7104 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 17 (Aircraft launching, landing &amp; ground handling equipment).</p>
<p>This RFI pertains to the integration requirement for this effort. RFI N68335-12-RFI-7101 and its identical simultaneous posting N68335-12-RFI-7102 pertain to logistics and are posted separate from this posting.</p>
<p>NAVAIR is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently capable of developing a Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP), as a prime system integrator for an improved Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Lighting System that will provide the US Marine Corps (USMC) with Vertical Landing (VTOL), Intermediate Phase (24-72 hrs) and Semi-Permanent Phase (72 hrs+) Lighting. SLP must address a wide range of operational challenges within the expeditionary environments including the increase in state of the art lighting solutions for intensity in order to reduce power needs as well as wireless control. NAVAIR acknowledges that there most likely will not be a single solution within industry and the solution would then come several industry players teaming under that prime system integrator. This teaming concept would be encouraged if it were advantageous to fielding SLP expeditiously while meeting requirements. Experience with the DOD acquisition process and Systems Engineering process that accompany are highly viewed and will make it easier. Broad industry participation is desired but NAVAIR is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production. Delivery of a capability within six years would be required and within less than five years is highly desirable. To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2015 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), NAVAIR requires current industry sources and capabilities information.<br />1. PURPOSE: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed SLP requirements. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher that have been validated in their relevant or operational environment. Examples would be testing in a high fidelity laboratory which emulates the expeditionary (where Marines deploy) environment or actual system prototype testing in any expeditionary environment.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The mission of the NAVAIR EAF program is to equip the Marine Corps to support Naval Aviation with the flexibility and capability to rapidly deploy and establish survivable, self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments. The EAF Concept is a shore-based, aviation weapons support system which permits deployment of landing force aircraft within effective range of ground forces. This concept allows for the construction of portable, reusable, forward-deployed airfields that can be assembled in a building block concept for the rapid introduction of air power. The EAF family of systems supports a myriad of airfield configurations, ranging in size and complexity from single-aircraft vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) sites, to short runways for tactical aircraft, to extended runways for heavy cargo lift, through the deployment of airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, airfield terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems.<br />The Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP) replaces the existing Legacy Hard-Wire Lighting System in the Marine Wing Support Squadrons of the Marine Aircraft Wing. The SLP will be employed to support flight operations at expeditionary/captured/host nation airfields. The SLP shall provide capabilities for permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps and shall provide VFR and CAT I IFR. The SLP shall be a lightweight system with a minimal logistical footprint, and can be scalable, easily employed and maintained while taking advantage of energy efficient technology. The lighting system shall be scalable to allow for various operating runway lengths, taxiways and parking areas and meteorological conditions.</p>
<p><br />4. OPERATIONAL CONCEPT: The SLP systems must operate with the EAF system as described above. There are a wide range of missions and operational situations in which the EAF system shall operate. Three mission concepts are provided below as representative of the range and scope of EAF implementation:<br /><br />&bull; Mission: Support VTOL sites and Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARP) operations. The system can be installed and retrograded by two EAF Marines.<br />&bull; Mission: Support AM2, bare-based and host-nation airfields or Tactical Landing Zones (TLZ) up to 4,000 ft. The system can be installed and retrograded by six EAF Marines.<br />&bull; Mission: Support Category I IFR AM2, bare-base and host-nation airfields or Tactical Landing Zones (TLZ) up to 6,000 ft. The system can be installed and retrograded by ten EAF Marines.<br />These missions shall be used to establish the physical context in which the SLP systems shall operate. This physical context shall help define the external interface required of the SLP to meet performance objectives. A VTOL Pad lighting system shall interface with the aircraft and surfacing system. A short term austere airfield for limited operations shall have additional external interfaces including maintenance personnel, airfield control and USMC mobile transport interfaces. The largest and most demanding over time is the Category I IFR airfield. Its elements are expanded interfaces including arresting gear and terminal guidance systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. REQUIREMENTS: Following general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:</p>
<p>The SLP shall be part of the EAF family of systems within the Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) of the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW). Depending on mission and environment, the current MWSS EAF lighting includes tactical, intermediate and semi-permanent systems per MCWP 3-21.1. A man-portable lighting system (0-24 hours) supports smaller short-term lighting requirements (tactical system), the Minimum Operating Strip Lighting System (MOSLS) provides a mid-term lighting capability (24-72 hours-intermediate system) and the semi-permanent Legacy Hard-Wire Lighting System (72 hours and beyond) provides capability for long term application. These latter two system capabilities, along with the added ability to provide long-term autonomous perimeter lighting for remote VTOL sites shall be incorporated in the SLP. <br />Components of the SLP shall be employed to support both Visual (VFR) and Instrumented (IFR, Category I) flight operations at expeditionary/captured/host nation airfields throughout the world. The SLP shall include a number of different illumination sources as required to support runway, taxiway, approach, signage and obstruction applications. The illumination sources shall be sized to meet the respective application, and the composition of lighting components shall be scalable to allow for various operating runway lengths, taxiway and parking area sizes and meteorological conditions. The SLP shall have a minimal logistical footprint, be easily employed and maintained in an expeditionary environment, take advantage of energy efficient technologies, and include organic power sources to allow sustained operation.<br />Applicable components shall withstand the heat signature of all US/NATO Aircraft (F-35B and MV-22), be compatible with all image intensification Night Vision Devices (NVD) systems (US and NATO), and be capable of remote control by both pilots and local EAF operators.</p>

<DESC>The Request for Information (RFI) is posted as a follow on to RFI N68335-12-RFI-7100.
<p>This RFI is identical to N68335-12-RFI-7103 which has been simultaneously posted under PSC Code 62 (Lighting Fixtures &amp; Lamps).</p>
<p>This RFI pertains to the integration requirement for this effort. RFI N68335-12-RFI-7101 and its identical simultaneous posting N68335-12-RFI-7102 pertain to logistics and are posted separate from this posting.</p>
<p>NAVAIR is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently capable of developing a Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP), as a prime system integrator for an improved Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Lighting System that will provide the US Marine Corps (USMC) with Vertical Landing (VTOL), Intermediate Phase (24-72 hrs) and Semi-Permanent Phase (72 hrs+) Lighting. SLP must address a wide range of operational challenges within the expeditionary environments including the increase in state of the art lighting solutions for intensity in order to reduce power needs as well as wireless control. NAVAIR acknowledges that there most likely will not be a single solution within industry and the solution would then come several industry players teaming under that prime system integrator. This teaming concept would be encouraged if it were advantageous to fielding SLP expeditiously while meeting requirements. Experience with the DOD acquisition process and Systems Engineering process that accompany are highly viewed and will make it easier. Broad industry participation is desired but NAVAIR is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production. Delivery of a capability within six years would be required and within less than five years is highly desirable. To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2015 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), NAVAIR requires current industry sources and capabilities information.<br />1. PURPOSE: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed SLP requirements. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher that have been validated in their relevant or operational environment.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the construction and operation of new and existing commercial nuclear power facilities. Office of New Reactors (NRO) serves the public interest by enabling the safe, secure, and environmentally responsible use of nuclear power in meeting the nation's future energy needs. Within NRO, the Division of Advanced Reactors and Rulemaking (DARR) Program has responsibility for managing the licensing process for new-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These include both integral pressurized water reactors (iPWRs) and non-PWR design technologies. The Office of Nuclear and Incident Response (NSIR), the Divisions of Security Policy and Preparedness/Response supports matters related to security, incident preparedness and response. Together, NRO and NSIR implement regulations and develop and implement policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities. The NRO and NSIR activities for new reactor licensing includes reviews of applications for reactor design certifications (DCs), early site permits (ESP), combined license (COL) applications, environmental reviews, and pre-application activities. The licensing activities associated with advanced reactors includes advanced reactor pre-application activities, environmental reviews, review of applications for limited work authorizations (LWA), construction permits (CP), operating licenses (OL), reactor design certifications (DC), reactor design approvals (DA), early site permits (ESP), combined license (COL) applications, and manufacturing licenses (ML).</p>
<p><br />The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) regulates the licensing and operation of commercial nuclear power and non-power (test and research) reactors to protect the public health and safety, and the environment. To accomplish this mission, NRR conducts a range of regulatory activities through 4 principle areas: rulemaking; licensing; oversight; and incident response. The technical work for licensing resides amongst the NRR Divisions of Safety Systems (DSS), Engineering (DE), Risk Assessment (DRA), License Renewal (DLR), Operating Reactor Licensing (DORL), Inspection and Regional Support (DIRS), and Policy and Rulemaking (DPR). Licensing actions include the review of requests to amend or renew a current license and/or design bases as described in the Technical Specifications or Final Safety Analysis Report. There are three main licensing actions for operating reactors: amendments; relief requests; and exemptions. The regulations for licensing of operating reactors are located in <br />10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50 (safety reviews) and 10 CFR 51 (environmental reviews). For the license renewal process, the requirements are located in 10 CFR 54 (safety) and 10 CFR 51 (environmental). In general, the staff processes licensing actions for individual plants and reactor operators, reviews licensee responses to identified safety issues, evaluates the safety implications of generic approaches to safety issues identified by reactor vendor groups, decommissions plants at the end of the licenses, and approves risk-informed revisions to plant technical specifications for commercial power and non-power reactor communities.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Sought</span></strong></p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in reviewing the myriad of documents related to the activities entailed by NRO, NRR and NSIR.</p>
<p>The technical personnel that may be performing work shall have expertise and/or experience in the following key areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive experience in the regulations and guidance of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in applicable laws and requirements, or equivalent experience in understanding regulatory requirements and associated regulatory guidance.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: THIS IS ONLY A MARKET SURVEY FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUCEMENT. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone Small Business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), 8(a) certified Small Business concerns, Woman-Owned Small Business concerns or Small Business concerns. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, with a small business size standard $33.5M Million. The estimated value of the procurement is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. Pursuant to FAR Part 28, Performance and Payment Bonds will be required.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking Interested Vendors with successful past performance, current relevant design and construction experience, personnel, equipment, capability and bonding capacity to perform the design-build effort to raise the roof of the Boat Maintenance Facility (BMF) at CG Station Jones Beach, Freeport, NY. Work includes conceptual and final design submissions, and construction for the following: The BMF, or shop building, was constructed in 1987. The shop building is a 101 ft long x 69 ft wide brick faced building. It is divided into three distinct sections with a high bay section in the center of the three. The high bay section is the boat maintenance bay. It is approx 54 ft long x 30ft-4 in wide. The bay has a roll-up door on the east and west side of the building. The east door is 22 ft tall x 26 ft wide and the west door is 12 ft tall x 12 ft wide. The high bay area has a low pitch roof with internal drainage and a structural framing system that at its lowest point is about 23 ft above the floor. In addition to the structural framing there are overhead utilities, such as heating and ventilation ducts, plumbing lines, and electrical conduit, which cross the shop floor space. These utilities provide service to the shop itself as well as crossing the shop area to the adjacent low-bay section of the building. The lowest utility line within the shop space is about 21 ft-9 in above the shop floor. The high bay section is a steel framed structure with concrete block and brick infill walls supported on concrete grade beams and a timber pile foundation. The high bay section is flanked on the north and south sides by the low roof sections of the BMF facility. The high bay section is used to perform maintenance on the 47 ft Motor Life Boat (MLB) and trailer mounted small boats. In order to accommodate the large boat, and travel lift used to move the boat, it is necessary to raise the height of the existing east door by approx 2 ft and the ceiling height by approx 8 ft (to accommodate lifting and setting the boat on haul-out cradles). In order to accommodate the small boat on a trailer, the west door height needs to be increase by 2 ft. Actual heights to be accommodated shall be field verified by the Design Engineer prior to finalizing the design. The Coast Guard has not yet made a decision as to whether this acquisition will be a one-step (turnkey) or two-step design build contract.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 19, if your firm is one of the above small business concerns and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by email to jean.m.bretz@uscg.mil with "Sources Sought for Solicitation HSCGG1-12- BMF-ROOF" in the subject line or by fax to (401) 736-1704. Your response should include the following: (a) a positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as prime contractor; (b) a statement identifying your certified small business designation; (c) evidence of bonding capacity to the maximum magnitude of the project, to include both single and aggregate totals; and, (d) evidence of specific experience in the following areas: (1) Managing/performing Design-build contracts; (2) design and/or construction of similar roof raising in industrial/commercial buildings. The experience requirements apply to both the design and the construction firm. Include information for past projects - including contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers and, experience in performing the work under strict time constraints.</p>
<p>Your response is required no later than 7 February 2012. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on an applicable set-aside, and solicitation type. If you have any thoughts, suggestions on the method of contracting, please provide comments with your response.</p>

<SUBJECT>Veterinarian Services for Macaques
<SOLNBR>req_570110
<RESPDATE>012012
<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:
<p>Requesting Agency:<br />USDA, APHIS, AC<br />4700 River Road, Unit 84<br />Riverdale, Maryland 20737</p>
<p>Contracting Activity:<br />USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD<br />Minneapolis Procurement Branch<br />Butler Square, 5th Floor<br />100 North 6th Street<br />Minneapolis, MN 55403</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:</p>
<p>Through a Consent Decision and Order, signed by a USDA Administrative Law Judge on October 31, 2011 (see attached), APHIS now owns approximately 115 Macaques (i.e., monkeys) located at the Wild Animal Orphanage, a licensed exhibitor in San Antonio. APHIS has agreed, through the Consent Decision and Order, to transfer ownership of the Macaques to Born Free, a sanctuary near San Antonio, when Born Free has completed the construction of new housing for the Macaques. APHIS agreed to arrange for and pay the costs of the following prior to the transfer:<br />&bull; Sterilization of each male Macaque;<br />&bull; Vaccination of each Macaque against tetanus;<br />&bull; Screening of each Macaque for tuberculosis;<br />&bull; Fecal screening and baseline blood work for each Macaque; and<br />&bull; Tattooing of each Macaque.</p>
<p>The above action was necessary in order to prevent APHIS from pursuing confiscation of the macaques and the likely position of having to euthanize all of them due to inability to place the animals.</p>
<p>3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE ACQUISITION INCLUSIVE OF OPTIONS):</p>
<p>Dr. Kirk, owner/operator of Falling Rock Veterinary Clinic, and a veterinarian from Primarily Primates (a sanctuary not required to be licensed under the Animal Welfare Act) will be responsible for overseeing on behalf of APHIS, the procedures listed in the Consent Decision and Order.</p>
<p>Welfare of the animal being our primary concern, in order to prevent un-due stress on the animals, the tuberculosis test will be completed at the same time the animals have been sedated for castration.</p>
<p>People work with Macaques every day. Proper handling of these animals is extremely important. This brings with it the need to have a trained team of experts carry out this work. Dr. Kirk has the appropriate level of expertise and local facilities to make this happen.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUATORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS:</p>
<p>The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253( c )(1)</p>
<p>5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:</p>
<p>The services must be provided by a veterinarian that possesses extensive experience conducting the procedures on Macaques as outlined in the Consent Decision and Order. It is also in the best interest of the Government to select an individual local to the situation to eliminate travel costs and/or transportation of the Macaques. Proper handling of these animals is extremely important, as Macaques are natural carriers of the Herpes-B virus, and untreated infection with this virus is fatal in humans. Dr. Kirk has the appropriate level of expertise needed to carry-out this delicate situation.</p>
<p>6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS, OR WILL BE, PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES: <br /><br />Animal Care's knowledge of the facilities with Macaques, both regulated and unregulated, in the San Antonio area allowed us to know the veterinarians that met the necessary criteria. APHIS has been providing technical support to Wild Animal Orphanage for over one year, working with industry groups and sanctuary groups. The bankruptcy and pending closure of Wild Animal Orphanage have been well publicized. As we performed research on other veterinarians qualified to perform the procedures, we found them to be prohibited sources due to their affiliation with facilities regulated under the Animal Welfare Act.</p>
<p>7. A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FORTHAT DETERMINATION:</p>
<p>The price is fair and reasonable based on a detailed cost breakdown of equipment, supplies, and hourly rates for the service as compared to similar services and internal price estimates.</p>
<p>8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (FAR ART 10) AND THE RESULTS, OR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT PERFORMED:</p>
<p>Our market research resulted in qualified personnel that are considered prohibited sources due to their affiliation with facilities we regulate under the Animal Welfare Act.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FAR 6.303-2(a)(9):</p>
<p>Veterinarians that are experienced enough to conduct the procedures listed above on Macaques, and, that don't work for a facility regulated under the Animal Welfare Act are rare. Given the Consent, Decision and Order, this situation must be handled by individuals the industry (animal welfare organizations) trust. Dr. Kirk has established that trust when it comes to the proper care and safe handling of macaques.</p>
<p>10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITON:</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>11. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY. THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Since this is one time service there are no further actions required.</p>
<p>12. I HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS JOFOC IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETETOTHE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF.</p>

<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking statements of capabilities from all commercial sources for its Logistics Program in support of the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program. DTRA is interested in obtaining near-term information demonstrating the viability of commercial solutions (those that are currently available and that could be made commercially available) for a logistics mission that would provide much better value than a government developed system. Successful commercial participation in the CTR mission could support a DTRA decision to pursue commercial services for its logistics requirements.</p>
<p>This RFI identifies multiple capabilities and interested parties are invited to respond to any or all of the logistics efforts described below.</p>
<p>The Contractor(s) shall accomplish the following tasks, when necessary, in a permissive, semi-permissive, or moderate threat environment:<br />Shipping/Warehousing and Property Support Services<br />&bull; World-wide door to door shipping services incorporating a technical aid, duty-free customs clearance process via the most expeditious, economical and efficient mode of service.<br />&bull; DTRA will maintain status as the exporter of record<br />&bull; Fulfillment activities for secure warehousing and inventory management sites strategically located to receive, store and distribute equipment while providing the USG the best value<br />&bull; World-wide property support services to provide projects with equipment/materials, maintenance services, security services, and property management.<br />&bull; Provide all export documentation<br />&bull; Transfer of Custody - see Glossary of Terms</p>
<p>Travel Support Services</p>
<p>&bull; World-wide travel support for CTR delegations, training collaborators, CTR-sponsored conference attendees and Congressional Delegations. This support will include, but not be limited to: visa acquisition, stipend payments, hotel reservations, obtaining or reserving meeting facilities, cell phone support, in-country travel support, to include door to door ground transportation, procurement of tickets for other modes of in-country transportation, airport transfers, ability to track travelers, translation/interpretation services and 24/7 emergency on-call services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Logistics Information System</p>
<p>&bull; An integrated web-based, searchable, information and reporting system housed within DTRA for managing and tracking all aspects of these tasks. System must have a robust recordkeeping and financial reporting capability.</p>
<p>Scenario examples and a Glossary of Terms of the above requirements are provided as attachments to the RFI on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, DTRA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>All commercial sources capable of providing these services are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting their responses to Nadine Rafaels, Contracting Officer via email at nadine.rafaels@dtra.mil by Wednesday, February 1, 2012 12:00, p.m. EST.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Seeking to improve upon stock stainless steel flame holders, researchers at NASAsLangley Research Center have developed a new ceramic design with a service temperature of4,000F. The combination of high strength and high temperature capability and a twistlock mounting method to the steel burner sets this flame holder apart from existingtechnology.The high output flame holder was developed in support of the U.S. Navys efforts todesign a jet engine simulator for infrared plume studies. Previous tests had shown thatoff-the-shelf components would melt or burn up in a short time. Given these design andperformance criteria, NASA developed a ceramic flame holder that has a much longer lifecycle and can be used with a variety of torches or burners. Where the stainless flameholders showed signs of oxidation, flaking after only three hours of testing, NASAsceramic flame holder has over 150 hours and 200 cycles of use in a casting furnace, andsoot marks are the only signs of use; there are no signs of deterioration. NASA expectsthe new technology to help enhance safety through increased reliability and flamecontrol. Additionally, the total cost of ownership is less due to decreased maintenanceand improved efficiency.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has demonstrated a powerful technique for real-time fiber optic sensing.This patent pending technology combines a compact in-fiber interferometric network withdistributed fiber optic Bragg grating sensors to enable real-time physical monitoringwith high accuracy and resolution. The technology offers the ability to simultaneouslymeasure hundreds of discreet fiber sensors without the need for slow and complex dataprocessing. NASA developed the technology to enable real-time monitoring of structuraland environmental conditions for vehicle health monitoring. The versatility of thistechnique offers broad utility in applications where high sensor counts and real-timemonitoring of physical parameters are required.The use of fiber optic-based sensors has enabled robust, low-cost, intrinsically safemeasurement of physical parameters like stress, temperature, pressure, and the presenceof certain chemicals. Fiber optic sensors can be used for single point detection or, inthe case of Bragg grating sensors that are written along the length of a fiber,distributed sensing for large area monitoring. However, the use of distributed Bragggrating sensors usually involves a compromise between the highly desirablecharacteristics of fast data acquisition, high sensor counts, and high resolution. Thenew NASA Real-Time Interferometric Fiber Optic Bragg Grating Sensor technology eliminatesthat compromise.The new NASA system modifies existing NASA Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometrytechnology (NASA patents US#5,798,521 and US#6,566,648) to eliminate the need for massivedata storage, complex algorithm manipulation, and the inherent limitations tied toprocessor speeds. By constructing a location-matched oscillator to each discrete sensorgrating, each Bragg grating spectra can be demodulated and peak-detected without the needfor complex digital processing. The resulting system allows hundreds of distributedsensors to be interrogated in real time, which is essential for immediate event detectionin safety-critical systems.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a firmware approach to mitigating single event upsets (SEUs)in radiation-tolerant field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), including configurationmemory, clock management, and configuration logic. Since this technology can beimplemented within an FPGA, there is no need for the additional external hardwarecurrently required for SEU mitigation, thus lowering cost, weight, and power; decreasingcomplexity; and improving reliability. NASA Langley has developed the technology forhigh-performance space-based computing applications. The technology has been tested andwill be used on an instrument on NASAs Mars Science Laboratory rover, scheduled forlaunch in 2009.NASA developed the technology to meet the needs for on-board satellite data processingfor future missions. The continuing trends toward ever-increasing resolution, improveddata quality, and additional capacity for raw and/or processed data will necessitate theuse of larger on-board memories, which must be made radiation tolerant. This technologyis a firmware approach to radiation-tolerant memory, suitable for both GEO and LEOmissions.Memory cells in FPGAs are susceptible to SEUs. It is important to correct configurationmemory upset as quickly as possible. NASA has used an approach of refreshing theconfiguration memory cells at regular intervals. The configuration bit stream is storedin memory and upon power-on, the FPGA loads its configuration from memory. The memoryrefresh controller is implemented internally in the FPGA. The correction of SEUs inconfiguration logic requires initial detection of a failure in configuration logic, whichhas also been developed and incorporated as part of this technology.In addition to detecting SEUs, the technology implements a scrubbing strategy where thememory contents are read sequentially and when an error is detected, the memory isupdated with correct data.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

This is a limited sources action to execute a bilateral modification for additional work under Task 2; Recommended Management Structure of Task Order D11PD40452 with the Performance Work Statement entitled Information Technology Transformation Detailed Planning, for the Chief Information Officer, Department of the Interior.  Task Order D11PD40452 was competitively awarded under the authority of FAR 8.401 Multiple-Award Schedule Program to McKinsey & Company against GSA Schedule GS-10F-0118S on July 28, 2011 with a period of performance of August 8, 2011 through December 23, 2011. The period of performance was subsequently extended until January 20, 2011 under Modification 0002 to allow the Government more time to evaluate the need for this additional in-scope work. The Firm-Fixed-Price of adding the supplemental in-scope work for this requirement is $544,090.04, which would bring the total price of the Task Order to $2,527,160.92.    	
The purpose of Modification 0003 under Task Order D11PD40452 is to provide additional in-scope assessment work under Task 2. Specifically, to conduct a deep-dive on the Information Technology Transformation Office (ITO) portion of the management structure to refine roles and responsibilities.  
The Department of Interior is in the process of fundamentally restructuring the way that Information Technology (IT) services are delivered to internal and external constituents.  This requirement was for McKinsey & Company to develop a detailed plan for Information Technology (IT) Transformation in order to create a modern, consolidated IT Service Delivery organization that will support all Department of the Interior (DOI) bureaus, offices and approximately 80,000 end users. McKinsey & Company has recently completed all of the deliverables outlined in the Performance Work Statement for that requirement, but the DOI seeks a deeper assessment of opportunities that were identified in the initial work under Task 2.  To complete this additional in scope requirement, McKinsey will need an additional four (4) weeks of performance. A notice to proceed was issued January 5, 2012 by the Contracting Officer, with the verbal authorization from the Competition Advocate, and Division Chief, to allow the Contractor to start work January 9, 2011. Therefore, the Period of Performance of the Task Order will be extended from August 8, 2011 through January 20, 2012 to August 8, 2011 to February 3, 2012.   

This modification will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price increase of $544,090.04 to the Task Order and; therefore, requires Competition Advocate concurrence in accordance with policy number NBCM-ACQ-6900-015.
3.	A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs (including the estimated value).
The Department of the Interior, Office of Chief Information Officer required a contractor to review the current general Information Technology (IT) Transformation Plan and make any further recommendations, and support the Government in the development of a detailed IT Transformation Plan that will achieve this strategic goal by moving DOI to an IT Service Management (ITSM) model for the delivery of IT services.  
Task 1 - Develop the detailed project plans and schedules for implementing the DOI IT Transformation Program.  The project plan provides a significantly more detailed view of the tasks, milestones, predecessors, interdependencies, critical path and resource requirements required to achieve the objectives of the DOI IT Transformation Program.
Task 2 - The deliverables identified in the plan from Task 1 shall be developed and delivered by the contractor within the period of performance of this requirement.
The eleven (11) deliverables under Task 2 of this requirement are as follows: 
1.	Initial IT Service Portfolio and IT Service Catalog2.	Process and Criteria for Identifying and Prioritizing New Elements of the IT Service Catalog3.	Detailed IT Services Lifecycle and Governance Model4.	Financial Modeling Templates and Chargeback Models5.	Management Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities6.	Enterprise Asset Management Implementation Plan7.	Enterprise Service Desk Implementation Plan8.	IT Transformation Communications Strategy9.	Organization Change Strategy10.	Data Center Consolidation Strategy11.	Sourcing and Acquisition Strategy that supports the OMB Cloud First Directive
The purpose of this current modification, Modification 0003 is to obtain additional support from McKinsey & Company under Task 2, the Recommended Management Structure.  The Department of the Interior is seeking a deeper assessment of opportunities that were identified in McKinseys initial work.  Specifically, McKinsey will:
1.	Provide recommendations on optimizing ITO in the transition state including detailed roles by leveraging external benchmarks and catalog of best-practice management structures,2.	Refine detailed listing of ITO responsibilities as related to reporting and tracking; change management and communications; portfolio and project management; and interdependency and issue resolution
The amount of this additional in-scope work is $544,090.04.
For this additional requirement, McKinsey & Company will provide a deliverable which will design the roles and responsibilities of the ITO and develop the tools/templates that will allow them to function effectively. 

4.	The Authority and Supporting Rationale. 
Orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the competition requirements in FAR Part 6.  However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration of federal supply schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.
The applicable authority permitting to limit sources is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B).  As cited in FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  Additionally, trying to identify any other possible source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling this additional in-scope requirement.
Under GSA Schedule GS-10F-0118S with McKinsey & Company, which includes FAR Clause 52.212-4 (c) Changes, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, provides the authority to modify the Task Order for this additional in scope requirement and the Period of Performance extension.  The extension is for an additional two (2) weeks. The price to conduct the deep-dive and extend the period of performance is $544,090.04.
5.	A Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d).
The additional in-scope requirement is to conduct a deep-dive on the ITO portion of management structure to refine roles and responsibilities.  Under this modification, additional assessment work will be provided under Task 2, Management Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities. 
The amount for the Period of Performance extension for the additional assessment work under the Task Order will be for a firm-fixed-price of $544,090.04.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the price of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d).
6.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.
Market Research was not conducted because a new competition would be impracticable due to the substantial learning curve involved in obtaining a new contractor who can provide the additional assessment work.  Obtaining a new contractor would not be a cost effective to the Government as the price to bring in a new contractor would cost significantly more than the quoted price of $544,090.04.     
All deliverables for this requirement will be complete once this two (2) week extension for additional work under the Task Order is completed.  At this time, the DOI does not anticipate any additional extensions or additional work for in scope activities will be required.  
7.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification.
Under this Task Order, McKinsey & Company, in their initial work, created eleven (11) deliverables under Task 2.  However, a deeper assessment of the management structure, roles and responsibilities is needed to help position the DOI for success during the course of this multi-year transformation. The Department was unaware that such an opportunity for the additional deep-dive would be identified during McKinseys performance of the requirement.  However, a more in-depth assessment of this opportunity as sought by DOI is within scope of Task 2  Recommended Management Structure.  As McKinsey has performed the initial work, the Government requires a further analysis of this opportunity to optimize the transition state structure, and focus on change management and communications, portfolio management, and interdependency/issue tracking and resolution.  
As McKinsey has performed this assessment from the beginning and identified this opportunity during the course of performance, only McKinsey & Company can perform this additional in scope work because they possesses the specific knowledge required to perform this analysis successfully.  
8.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers that Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made.
All deliverables for this requirement will be complete once this two (2) week extension for additional work under Task two (2) is completed.  At this time, the DOI does not anticipate any extensions or additional work for in-scope activities will be required.  
A new competition would be impracticable due to the substantial learning curve involved in obtaining a new contractor who can provide the additional work as this work will only be provided for an additional two (2) weeks.  Obtaining a new contractor would not be a cost effective to the Government as the price to bring in a new contractor would cost significantly more than the quoted price of $544,090.04.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Sole Source to Ion Science (Americas) for PIDs
<SOLNBR>

<a href="mailto:Fisher.Trina@epa.gov">Fisher, Trina</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Ion Science (Americas) LLC for purchase of Photo-Ionization Detectors.
Scope and Capabilities: The objective is to purchase six fully-enabled PhoCheck Tiger photo-ionization detectors (PIDs) and six CGA 600 Gas Regulators. The required PIDs are specific to and compatible with EPA's investigative procedures for air toxics compliance inspections and must meet the following critical performance criteria: 1) Internal data logger clock accurate to 3 sec/day; 2) Rapid Response Time (Zero to full scale); 3) Reads 0 ppb to 20,000 ppm. Specifically, the internal data logger clock must be accurate to within 3 seconds during the course of the day because organic gas concentration measurements are averaged during each 15-second time period. In order to compare the Inspectors field notes with the logged data, the PID logger time-stamp must be reasonably close to the actually time. The response time of the PID is important because the instrumental response to changes in gas concentration values must occur rapidly enough for the Inspector to make valid measure ments in a reasonable amount of time during the course of taking field measurements. Lastly, EPA Inspectors must be able to determine the concentrations of gaseous leaks above 10,000 ppm for purposes of monitoring in accordance with EPA Method 21.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Ion Science is the sole vendor that meets all of the specifications required for the PIDs as listed above. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST 10 calendar days after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

These VNCC Software Licenses are required tosupport the Joint UHF Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) NetworkIntegrated Control system (JMINI CS) to support warfighter communications.Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.ViaSat, Inc. is the only company that currently produces the RT-1828 radio thatcan be used for 5 kHz channel control of UHF Demand Assigned Multiple Access(DAMA) Satellite Communications (SATCOM).The RT-1828 is a proprietary product of ViaSat.  Because of the proprietarydesign of this radio, there appears to be no other commercially availablesoftware to enable 5 kHz channel control of this radio.  There is a limitedmarket for UHF SATCOM products due to the limited number of on-orbit assets andthe substantial cost to develop, test and successfully launch UHF satellites.Due to this small market, there are few companies that provide UHF radios, andonly one that is known to have a COTS radio that can be utilized as a 5 kHzchannel controller meeting Military Standards 188-182A, 188-185.  The 5 kHzfrequency band is not commonly used due to more robust radio frequency bandsthat offer higher data rates.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirement or submit proposals.  Information received will normally beconsidered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct acompetitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to compete theproposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within thediscretion of the Government.The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is541511and the size standard is $25,000,000.  The estimated value of the effortis $1,600,000.  Questions concerning this sole source contract action may bedirected to David W. Decker at SPAWAR SSC Pacific, 53560 Hull Street, SanDiego, CA 92152-5001; email: david.decker2@navy.mil;Questions and/or responses are due by 09 February 2012.

<DESC>HYDRAULIC SAND BACKPASSING OPERATION, AVALON, NEW JERSEY, DEMOSTRATION PROJECT, INDUSTRY DAY
<p>On February 7, 2012 at 10:00 AM EST you are invited to an Industry Day at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, Wanamaker Building (6th Floor), 100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This meeting encourages businesses to identify ideas for the design specifics for a hydraulic sand backpassing operation including pipeline equipment and associated logistics in Avalon, New Jersey. This information (questions/comments) will be used as a tool in preparing the plans and specifications of the operation. <br /><br />The beach nourishment is a critical component of shore protection programs within New Jersey and Delaware. Presently, eight Federally-authorized beach nourishment projects have been constructed in New Jersey and five have been constructed in Delaware. In New Jersey, four of the projects have experienced substantial erosion within localized areas, while the portions of the projects down drift of the high erosion areas are at or above the design templates.</p>
<p>Sand bypassing/backpassing is a technique that has been utilized in several U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coastal projects across the nation to assist in maintaining project beaches. Due to the nature of the extreme erosion being experienced at a number of the New Jersey beach nourishment projects, the Philadelphia District is investigating hydraulic sand backpassing as an environmentally less intrusive means to better manage sediment for individual projects and within the region. Specifically at locations that experience accelerated "hot-spot" erosion hydraulic sand backpassing offers the benefit of sand replenishment, maintaining the authorized level of storm damage reduction between large periodic nourishment operations, in a potentially cost-effective manner. Hydraulic sand backpassing can be implemented more frequently, for smaller volumes of sand, and can be cost-effectively accomplished with offshore borrow sites and typical seagoing hopper or hydraulic dredges.</p>
<p>The work consists of hydraulically moving approximately 100,000 cubic yards of sediment along the beach in the Borough of Avalon, Cape May County, New Jersey. Sediment backpassing is a technique that reverses the natural migration of sediment by transporting it from accretive down drift areas to erosive up drift areas of the beach. The sediment will be borrowed and transported through the use of an hydraulic pump and pipeline from between 30th and 60th Streets, and be placed in the northern portion of Avalon, between 8th and 20th Streets, a distance ranging between 1 and 4 miles.</p>
<p>Several hydraulic transport pump types have been considered in existing literature including: jet pump (educator) deployed from land-based vehicle (crawler crane); jet pump (educator) deployed from hybrid platform (Wilco dragline); centrifugal dredge pump (Toyo) deployed from land-based vehicle; centrifugal dredge pump (Toyo) deployed from hybrid platform (Wilco dragline); and portable dredge (mud cat). Initial screening-level cost analysis has indicated this project range to be in the amount of $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Hydraulic pump specifics for discussion include pump/educator size, target production rates, pump platform, need for booster pumps, and crater excavation depths and infilling rates.</p>
<p>Other equipment considerations for discussion include pipeline characteristics (material and diameter), equipment rent or purchase (and permanent placement), development of more detailed cost estimates, and safety concerns.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to attend in person or via webinar on the specified date. Interested Parties must e-mail Michele N. Evans at Michele.N.Evans@usace.army.mil by January 31, 2012 2:00 PM EST. Further details about the dial-in information will be provided by February 02, 2012.</p>

ET 02-20	AUTHORIZED WORKERS NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CONTRACTORS	SEPTEMBER 2002
(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:  http://www.uscis.gov/i-9
(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
	(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
	(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
	(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings
I.3	52.222-42	STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES	                     MAY 1989
In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4), this clause identifies the classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract and states the wages and fringe benefits payable to each if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332.

NOTIFICATION TO ALL CONTRACTORS	The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security.  Each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised.
Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents.  To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority.  Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information."  Although the Department has taken steps to secure access to publicly published classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard. 
Contractors therefore are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of non-classified government information technology systems:
Except as authorized by their agencies and pursuant to agency procedures, contractors shall not, while using Government issued computers or other devices (such as Blackberries or Smart Phones) access the web on non-classified Government systems, access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto non-classified systems.  This requirement applies to access that occurs either through agency or contractor computers, or through employees' or contractors' personally owned computers that access non-classified Government systems.  This requirement does not restrict contractor access to non-classified, publicly available news reports (and other non-classified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as distinguished from access to underlying documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are available on public Web sites or otherwise in the public domain).
Contractors shall not access classified material unless a favorable determination of the person's eligibility for access has been made by an agency head or the agency head's designee, the person has signed and approved non-disclosure agreement, the person has a need to know the information, and the person has received contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
Classified information shall not be removed from official premises or disclosed without proper authorization.
Contractors who believe they may have inadvertently accessed or downloaded classified or sensitive information on computers that access the web via non-classified government systems, or without prior authorization, should contact their Contracting Officer immediately.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your vigilance to these responsibilities.  If you have any questions regarding handling classified documents, or the blocking of access to sites which have inappropriately posted classified materials, please contact your Contracting Officer.  It will be the Contracting Officer's responsibility to contact the appropriate Government personnel regarding these matters.
GP-20	TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION AND DATA UNIVERSAL NUMBERING SYSTEM	              JANUARY 2005
The contractor shall submit with their offer the following information:
Taxpayer Identification Number:  ____________________________
Data Universal Numbering System:  __________________________
If a contractor does not have a DUNS number, they may obtain one by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Capital IQ Inc. for their web and Excel-based research platform and Add-on datasets. The Government intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for a 5 year period.
<p>Contractor's deliverable product must provide:</p>
<p>A web and Excel-based platform that combines deep information on companies, markets, and people worldwide with tools for fundamental analysis, idea generation, and workflow management.</p>
<p>Global company fundamentals including company financials, relationships among firms and people, biographical and contact data, transactions, events, securities data, ownership, brokerage estimates, corporate governance, regulatory filings, and news.</p>
<p>Direct access to data in Excel using simple formulas and an extensive selection of prebuilt model templates, reports, and charts. Build and maintain financial models.</p>
<p>Populate spreadsheets with financials, estimates, transactions, ownership, market, trading multiples and company data.</p>

<p>Real-time quotes, news, and fundamental analysis. Coverage includes stocks, indices, mutual funds, futures, options, currencies, and commodities along with contextual access to company fundamentals.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Capital IQ Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.).

Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

Solicitation number<br />2. Closing Date: January 27th, 2012 at 12:00 pm CST<br />3. Name, address and telephone number of company and email address of contact person.<br />4. Technical description of the item/service being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements of the <br />solicitation.

Past performance information, when included as a "best value" factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or <br />similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant <br />information).</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (May 2011). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (June 2010), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>

Competition is impractical for the followingreasons: This unique curriculum in Project Management is provided by the Stevens Institute ofTechnology School of Systems and Enterprises and Howe School of Technology Management,which currently provides the largest graduate program in system engineering in the U.S.and is the largest provider of system engineering education worldwide. Stevens Instituteis an internationally-recognized university with specialization in system engineering andproject management for space applications.  Stevens Institute provides the only graduatecertificate program in the country in project management with a focus on space systems.The Stevens Institute instructors have written and/or edited the only integratedcollection of 14 published textbooks and references that capture the full spectrum ofsystem engineering and project management and their application to NASA design experienceand lessons learned.  Further, Stevens Institute is the provider of choice for projectmanagement training for the National Security Agency, Federal Aviation Administration,Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Energy and keyindustry organizations.  These certificate programs are one-of-a-kind and provide NASA's aspiring and practicingsystem engineers with design experience and lessons learned from over 35 years of NASA,Department of Defense and industry experience designing and operating space missions andsystems. The project management curriculum is comprised of two, 3-semester hour modules whichconstitute are a unique combination of hands-on project management development: Space domain focus on project managementbalanced and integrated technical domain andsystem management tied to NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management RequirementsNM 7120.81 (NASA Interim Directive (NID) for NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7120.5D),and NASA Procedural Requirements 7123.1A. Hands-on courses and laboratories are delivered onsite which saves travel dollars forJSC and time for employees.  The courses have a flexible delivery, scheduled to suit employee constraints and workschedules (for example employees attend 3 days in one week, have a break of 6 weeks, andthen complete the remaining 2 days in another week).  Professors actually wrote the book. Project Management for Space Systems, along with ahost of NASA employees, industry and other government experts in project management forspace systems. This book forms the foundation of the curriculum. Each of the two courses earns participants 3-semester hours of graduate credit leadingto a Graduate Certificate in Project Management.Stevens faculty provided tailored courses that participants found directly applicable totheir project management roles and gave each of the modules high marks. In addition,Stevens project management courses are accredited by the Project Management Institute(PMI) and the Global Accreditation Center for Project Management (GAC).  Stevens was onlythe third university worldwide to receive this distinction when it was accredited in2004. Stevens has a significant leadership role in project management education andresearch; faculty currently have three PMI research grants in program and projectmanagement. The faculty provides the ability to tailor curriculum to meet the needs ofNASA and JSC, utilize NASA terminology, examples, and homework, and demonstrate knowledgeof project management as applied to space systems.  Stevens Institute of Technology professors, Dr. Wiley Larson, Dr. Robert Seymour, Dr. Jeff Austin and their team, are the only known source that can provide the necessarybreadth and depth of this integrated curriculum across the spectrum of robotic spacesystems and crewed space systems. Research using the internet web determined that noother firms or universities were able to perform this requirement. Due to Steven'sInstitute's 55 years of unique experience in system engineering and project managementtraining and education with other governmental agencies and leading companies, and thefact that the workshops are derived from NASA experience, Stevens is the only reasonablechoice to meet NASA's requirements. The Steven's Institute is one of the oldestuniversities in the country, specializing in system engineering and project managementeducation and training. Their knowledge of NASA programs, culture, and interaction withpersonnel has proven their capability. Due to the legacy of success that this spacesystem engineering and project management development concept has demonstrated, there isno other source that can replicate the comprehensiveness and quality of this supplier'straining.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using the procedures in FAR Part13.106.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. centralstandard time on February 10, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Amanda McInnis atAmanda.T.McInnis@nasa.gov.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This book forms the foundation of the curriculum.	These two courses earn participants 3-semester hours of graduate credit leadingto a Graduate Certificate in Space Systems Engineering.  Since May 2007, JSC has piloted three system engineering curriculum including programsfrom University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, and theStevens Institute of Technology. Based on written and verbal feedback received from theparticipants, the Stevens Institute curriculum received the highest ratings of the threeprograms because the curriculum emphasized design and development of space systems,whereas the other two programs did not. In addition, participants stated that the breadthof knowledge the instructors possessed was far superior to any previous systemsengineering instructors they had encountered because the instructors had "real-world"experience. Furthermore, participants stated that the curriculum content had immediateapplication and relevance to their current projects and work assignments. In addition,this curriculum was used in the inaugural class of JSC's Space Systems EngineeringDevelopment Program from 2008 - 2010, and the curriculum continues to receive ravingreviews for content and quality of instruction. NASA/JSC's Engineering Directorate andConstellation SE&I, in conjunction with Human Resources and many of NASA/JSC's finestsystem engineers, have worked for the past 18 months to shape this program to meet theexact needs of NASA/JSC employees. While other vendors may provide generic systemengineering curriculum, it would not be time or cost effective for NASA to select anothervendor, which would require the vendor to customize the content for space applications.  Stevens Institute Technology professors. Dr. Dinesh Verma and Dr. Wiley Larson and theirteam, are the only known source that can provide the necessary breadth and depth of thisintegrated curriculum across the spectrum of robotic space systems and crewed spacesystems.

Previous testing at the ERDC has identified rapid-setting flowable fill as a potential solution to backfill damaged pavements providing minimal interruption of operation.<br><br>Work<br>One hundred and twenty eight (128) cubic yards of rapid-setting flowable fill are required to backfill 18 simulated bomb craters at the ERDC Poor House testing facility. Materials will be evaluated using both the traditional wet-mixed method and the accelerated dry-placement method. The traditional method includes the use of fixed volume "drum type" or volumetric mixers. The dry-placement method involves dispensing the aggregate-cementitious blend directly into the prepared excavation and metering the required mix-water over the backfill surface. The mix-water is allowed to percolate through the dry material matrix, hydrating the cementitious materials, providing a hardened layer with the properties of in-place flowable fill. ERDC researchers will examine the current rapid repair methods in addition to developing optimized procedures that minimize labor intensity, manpower, equipment, and construction time requirements. <br><br>Specifications<br>1.	Capability to be placed using both the traditional wet-mixed and dry-placement methods.<br>2.	Ultimate 28-day compressive strength of 750 to 1,200 psi determined in accordance with ASTM International standard test method ASTM D 4832 when placed using the traditional method.<br>3.	Seventy percent (70%) or more of the ultimate 28-day compressive strength must be achieved when placed using the dry-placement method.<br>4.	Initial hardening must be completed in 30 minutes or less determined in accordance with ASTM D 6024.<br>5.	Flow consistency of 8 to 12 inches determined in accordance with ASTM D 6103 when placed using the traditional method.<br>6.	Minimal segregation (< 5%) of solid and liquid mixture proportions determined in accordance with ASTM C 1610 when placed using the traditional method.<br>7.	Minimal linear shrinkage (< 2%) of hardened specimens determined in accordance with ASTM C 426 when placed using the traditional method.<br><br>Requirements<br>1.	Results of standardized testing, material safety data sheet (MSDS), and optimal mix-water proportions for both the traditional and dry-placement methods must be provided to the technical point of contact (POC) within 30 days of awarding contract.<br>2.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Site visits may be arranged by contacting the COTR designated in the solicitation schedule.

4.4	All contractor owned equipment shall be installed in accordance with NFPA
50: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2001; NFPA 99 Standard for Health Care Facilities, 2005 Edition; and FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) Regulations.

In accordance with VHA Patient Safety Alert dated April 5, 2004, all deliveries must be monitored by a qualified and trained technical representative that will be designated by the facility. Contractor will be provided with names and contact information of primary and back-up facility representatives. This applies to all deliveries regardless of time or day of execution.

5.3	Tank(s) will be filled to maximum functional capacity at each refilling procedure unless otherwise specified in the facility requirements or as agreed upon in a written document signed and dated by the COTR.

5.4	At the time of each delivery, contractor must provide a legible signed and dated written document that identifies the tank level prior to fill, the level after fill, and the quantity delivered. This document must be counter-signed by the facility representative supervising the delivery.

5.5	Emergency delivery will be provided within 24 hours after receipt of Government notification. Contractor must respond to the facility by either telephone or email within one hour to confirm receipt of emergency notification to ascertain the nature of the emergency. Emergency status is determined by the Government when conditions warrant, such as an actuated main bulk tank low level alarm, imminent alarm condition, or system leak. Failure of the contractor to remain current with agreed delivery schedule and requirements does not constitute an "emergency" for purposes of charging an emergency delivery fee.

7.	Applicable Regulations & Standards

The following is a list of some of the regulations and standards that are applicable to this contract. The list is not comprehensive, and the contractor is responsible for ensuring that all products, equipment and services provided under the contract are in compliance with applicable Federal, state, and local regulations. If applicable, the editions in effect as of the date of this solicitation are listed. Contractor is responsible for remaining compliant with any future revisions that are effective at the time of contract performance.

Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 & 211 - CGMP regulations for supplying medical grade oxygen.

29 CFR 191 0.104 Applies to the installation of bulk oxygen systems on industrial and institutional consumer premises

49 CFR - Transportation

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

NFPA 50: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2001 Edition

NFPA 99: Standard for Health Care Facilities, 2005 Edition

U.S.P. 23

Density data and volume measurement equivalents published in Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet No. P-6, titled "Standard Density Data, Atmospheric Gases and Hydrogen," shall be used when necessary to convert measurement of gases from one form to another. For example, the following conversion factor shall apply for conversion from gallons to cubic feet.

Calculation based on data in CGA P-6

1 ft3 liquid 02 = 860.6 ft3 gas (Table 1)
1 ft3 liquid 02 = 7.48052 gal ((Table 2)

Therefore:

7.48052 gal (1 ft3) liquid 02 = 860.6 ft3 gas

1 gal liquid 02 = 860.6 ft3 gas
7.48052

1 gal liquid 02 = 115.05 ft3 gas
or more commonly quoted as 1 gal liquid 02 = 115.1 ft3 gas

<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. personal services contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Assistant is a member of one of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak), Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Assistant's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>With this solicitation, OTI intends to hire Program Assistants for its AME team. After an initial time with AME, at the discretion of senior leadership, there may also be opportunities to work with other Regional Teams within OTI.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI's Asia and Middle East (AME) Regional Team currently supports programs in Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Sri Lanka, Tunisia and Yemen and a Regional Advisor based in Bangkok.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>

<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Assistant requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Program Assistant requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Program Assistant is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Assistant is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Assistant has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Assistant is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Assistant will:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies;</p>

<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Regional Team Contracting Officer Representative (COR) in working with implementing partners (contracts, grants, cooperative agreements), ensuring OTI's requirements are met. The successful completion of the USAID COR Training Course is required within the first 6-12 months of employment;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, other USG agencies and departments, NGOs, international donors, and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Assistant will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<a href="mailto:virginia.l.babcock4.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Aberdeen Installation</a>
<DESC>Questions and Answers 1/20/12<br><br>1. Overall: Can the contracting office please provide estimated workload/work counts for the following activities:<br>	 <br><br> 	CLN 00001 Task 1.8: Number of special report studies to be required<br><br>	Answer: One history report of service orders, and IJO Job Orders (open, priority, status) due weekly. Random report requests average 2 per week.<br><br> <br> 	Task 0002 General): - Number of handhelds to be maintained<br><br>	Answer: Approximately 120 in stock, 90 currently in use.<br><br> <br> 	0001 2.2.1: Number of expected on-site support visits<br><br>	Answer: Once per month, minimum, or as needed for service calls and to review performance at Aberdeen and Edgewood areas.<br><br> <br> 	2.2.2: Expected frequency of trainings required<br><br>	Answer: Refresher training for current users will be conducted every other month alternating between Aberdeen and Edgewood areas. New users will be trained as assigned handheld duties and then refresher training as<br>current users.<br><br><br>2. 0001- 1.4.5 and 1.4.6 - Can additional detail and information be provided on what is meant by "The Contractor shall manage the Warranty/Service Contract Process" and "The Contractor shall manage the Work Flow processes"?<br><br>	Answer: Both Warranty/Service processes are automated work flows that generate alerts to individuals for action. The contractor will update any changes in the point of contact for each action point or modifications to action points in these work flows.<br><br> <br>3. 0001-1.7: Can an assumption be made that currently, 100% of MAXIMO data is accurate and complete, or will the contractor be responsible for validating existing data from either a data validation or data accuracy perspective?<br><br>	Answer: The data currently in MAXIMO will no longer be updated through duplicate entry in MAXIMO and GFEBS therefore the accuracy and completeness of MAXIMO is not relevant and will be maintained/fed through GFEBS only and MAXIMO will only serve as the Web page work order requests, warranty, and status for APG customers until MAXIMO is no longer used (FY12) at APG.<br><br> <br>4. 0001-1.10: Can additional information/workload be provided on what is meant by the Workflow analysis, Process Analysis, and PM/Job Plan Analysis in task 1.10?<br><br>	Answer: Both Warranty/Service processes, PM job plans are automated work flows that generate alerts to individuals for action. The contractor will update any changes in the point of contact for each action point or modifications to action points in these work flows. The analysis of each process would determine the efficiency of each process and recommendations to improve or modify those processes. With the multitude of customers (63) on APG these process will require constant review and revision to service all those various requirements. <br><br> <br>5. 0001-2: Can the contracting office provide the interval for periodic handheld servicing required. Can the contracting office provide the current count of operable and inoperable handhelds, and if contractor will be required to bring inoperable handhelds back to operable status?<br><br>	Answer: Answer: Approximately 120 in stock, 90 currently in use. The contractor will request repair or parts (batteries) through the COR on an as needed basis to keep as many of the 120 operational. Repair and parts are subject to government funds available and may impact the contractors ability to maintain 100% maintenance.<br><br><br>6. 0001-2.1.5: Is the only maintenance to be done on the handhelds what is included in 2.1.5.1 (The Contractor shall travel on-site as necessary to reload Handhelds that are reporting errors). No other system diagnosis or repair of physical hardware (including battery replacement) will be required?<br><br>	Answer: System diagnosis or repair of physical hardware (including battery replacement) required will be performed by APG maintenance contract. The contractor for GFEBS support staff are only required to identify the problem and make request through COR for repairs/parts.<br>	<br><br>7. 0001-3.1: Is the GFEBS help desk an APG-wide help desk, a Garrison-wide help desk, or is it specific to Garrison DPW Operations and Maintenance GFEBS Work Order processes and issues?<br><br>	Answer: GFEBS help desk will field calls APG-wide. Help desk will then provide POC information within DPW in support of Garrison and Garrison supported organizations.<br><br><br>8. 0001-3.1.2: Can the contracting office provide an estimate for the number of calls that the GFEBS help desk will receive?<br><br>	Answer: Estimated number is not easily imagined since APG has just gone live with GFEBS. It can be assumed the number of calls will be limited until the resource has been advertised and then will most likely increase, however, all calls will be answered as they are received and backlog may occur and call back will be made. Voice message system will catch any overflow or missed calls.<br><br><br>9 0001-3.3: Will the estimated workload allow the help desk monitor/manager also perform the administrative duties in 3.1.3? Can the contracting office estimate and quantify the amount of administrative workload?<br><br>	Answer: Fielding calls will have priority. Administrative duties will be as time allows in between calls. Admin suspense dates will be determined by call workload.<br><br><br>10. Regarding the Certification of "Master Data Maintainer" and "Real Property Data Maintainer", this can be done within 90 days after award, right, or are you requiring us to have these certifications by the time we bid?<br><br>	Answer: Per W91ZLK-12-T-0070 under SUBMIT REQUIREMENT AND BASIS OF EVALUATION FOR EACH FACTOR, offerors shall submit certifications of ""Master Data Maintainer" and "Real Property Data Maintainer" granted by GFEBS.  To be considered acceptable, the minimum requirement must be met.  They must be submitted with your proposal.<br><br>11. Three questions together:<br> 	Who is the incumbent ?<br> 	What is the incumbent's contract # ?<br> 	What was last year's incumbent contract $ value ?<br><br>Answer:  Only portions of this requirement were performed previously (MAXIMO).  This <br>procurement represents a new requirement as APG DPW transitions to the GFEBS system.

Period of performance: 21 February 2012 through 30 September 2012. (See Statement of Work), 1, EA;<BR>LI 002, CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING (CMR) FOR CONTRACT SERVICES.  The Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) system is a business process to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractors report actual labor hours, dollars, and other information directly from their accounting systems directly into this system, or through their Army Requiring Activity, using their existing timekeeping, personnel, accounting systems as well as information supplied with the contract. Existing financial management and procurement systems do not completely distinguish between goods and services, nor do they identify the specific organization for which the work is being performed. CMR will enable the Army to (1) fully understand the composition of the Army workforce - military, civilian, and contractor, and allow for more informed workforce staffing and funding decisions; and (2) provide better oversight of our workforce, avoid duplication of effort, or shifting of in-house reductions to contract.  Contractor labor hours and associated labor costs are to be treated as proprietary information when linked to contractor name and contract number.The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contract manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for services performed on this contract.  The Contractor is required to completely fill in all the information in the Mandatory Reporting System for this contract and will be formatted using the following web address:  https://contractormanpower.army.pentagon.mil
As part of its mandatory reporting contract services submission, the Contractor will also provide the estimated total cost (if any) incurred to comply with this reporting requirement.  This Reporting period will be the period of performance ending 30 September 2012 and must be reported by 31 October 2012, This is a YEARLY REQUIREMENT.

The training is accessible from any computer and is available at https://atlevel1.dtic.mil/at/.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Please be advised, this is a synopsis, NOT a solicitation. <br /><br />CBP intends to award a sole source contract to Chenega Technology Services Corporation (CTSC) as a bridge procurement for program management and integrated logistics support (ILS) services to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for managing, controlling, and securing our Nation's borders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is a 6-month base period with 6 one-month option periods. </span>CTSC and its subcontractors will be required to provide support for technically-complex and high-value inspection, detection, and surveillance equipment systems currently used by CBP/ETP to assist in securing the land border crossings, airports, seaports, rail crossings, mail handling, and express cargo consignment facilities within the United States and participating countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p>Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jan 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-</p>
<p>"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant.

<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">1. Criterion 1 - Adequacy of Response.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror&rsquo;s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2. Criterion 2 - Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. <strong><em>{An assessment of the degree of confidence provided by the proposed verification</em></strong> <strong><em>approaches/methods will also be included.} </em></strong>In the event that enhancements are proposed, the enhancements will be evaluated to determine whether the approach taken is feasible and will result in an end product/service that fully meets or exceeds the RFP requirements.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Stated experiment encompasses the accomplishment of work by the proposer which is comparable or related to the effort required under this procurement. Past performance indicate how well the proposer did on the earlier work. (At a minimum, the contactor should list/demonstrate their experience in working with the U.S. Government in presentations at meetings/ conferences for groups of similar size to ours over the last three years.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Cost/Price factors are those factors, which indicate the adequacy and realism of the cost proposal and the probable cost that will be incurred should the Government choose to contract with the proposer. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>The evaluation of cost factors will include an assessment of the probable cost of doing business with each proposer during the course of the contract. It will also include a comparison with commercial industry estimate of the cost. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;"><span>Cost will not be the deciding factor when proposals are ranked in the technically acceptable range. Technical and Past Performance combined will carry more weight than Cost. </span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received in reference to this solicitation.<br /><br />Q: What is the expected extension for the tension tests?<br />A:&nbsp; It is likely that most of our work can be performed with extensions of 3-5 cm.&nbsp; The upper limit of our testing may range to 10 cm.<br /><br />Q:&nbsp; The specifications state the system needs to be upgradable to 1,500 lbs.&nbsp; Based on the loads specified in this tender the maximum being 250 pounds, what would the application be that would warrnt the need to be able to go up to approximately 1,500 pounds?<br />A:&nbsp; We are anticipating that future samples (bone) may require much higher loads.<br /><br />Q:&nbsp; What is the application and load values for the test that warrant the need for the test system to be on its side?<br />A:&nbsp; Load values are same as indicated in tender.&nbsp; Longer specimens will require larger baths.&nbsp; The baths may be either taller or potentially longer.&nbsp; Having longer, shallower baths will better facilitate manipulation of the tissues being tested.&nbsp; For instance, we might stimulate the tissues electrically or incise various portions of the tissue being testing.&nbsp; This would not be easily performed in a system oriented vertically.<br /><br />Quote packages are due by 8:00 PM EST on January 26, 2012.&nbsp; Quotes must be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:micreenan@usuhs.mil">micreenan@usuhs.mil</a>.&nbsp; Quotes will not be accepted by any other means.&nbsp; Late quotes will not be considered.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the Dredge Goetz in the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. The dredge is of a hydraulic cutter suction configuration with a 22 inch suction and 20 inch discharge pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dredge is 225 feet long by 39 feet wide with an operating draft of 5 feet. The dredge power system is diesel-electric.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary diesel generating plant produces a total of 4,000 installed horsepower at 1,200 rpm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each generator is capable in producing 1,300 KVA at an 80% continuous duty cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Essential AC motors are controlled by means of variable frequency AC drive (VFD) components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The swing drive manufacturer is Alstom, model number MV3000. The dredge has swing winches installed on the port and starboard sides. The two winches are employed to swing the head of the dredge back and forth across the river, allowing the cutterhead and main dredge pump suction to break up and clear away material from the river bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While in operation one winch is hauling and the opposite is paying out cable under variable hold-back tension, with both cables being connected to external anchors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The paying-out cable is kept taut by dynamic braking through the winch gearing and VFD programming, preventing a slack cable situation. An operator controls the winches through console-mounted joystick controls which provide the means to regulate the speed at which the dredge swings back and forth and the degree of hold-back tension on the winch that is paying out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the dredge completes a swing from one side of the river to the other the swing process is reversed. The operator has the discretion to independently operate either the port and/or the starboard winch for other specific tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dredge operates 24 hours per day 7 days per week for about 6 to 8 months per year. During a 24 hour period, the swing winches typically log between 10 and 11 hours of running time. The remainder of the period the dredge is not swinging. Swing rates vary depending on the amount and hardness of the material being dredged. In hard material with a digging depth of several feet the swing speed (and drum speed) may be as low as 5 feet per minute at the maximum torque available from the drive. In light material with shallow cuts the swing speed will range up to 80 feet per minute at the maximum torque available from the drive. </span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The dredge was manufactured in 2005 and has been in service since that date. The two swing winches supplied with the dredge were manufactured by the IHC Company of Holland. The gear reducers in the winches were manufactured by the C. Kraaijeveld B.V. Company of Holland. The manufacturer's type designation is KA.15.E.TR. The following information is offered to provide a description of the gearbox:</span></p>

Loose fits were also observed between gears and shafts. Fits were corrected and the lubricant was changed to ISO 320 with molybdenum for the third and fourth work seasons. Maximum torque available to the gear reducer was reduced and the maximum rate of change of speed was decreased by changing VFD settings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pitting has continued to develop at a lower rate. Replacement of the winches has been scheduled to avoid a gear reducer failure during the work season. </span></p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<DESC>This is a notice to inform industry that the Air Force will be issuing a draft Request for Proposals (draft RFP) for the Enterprise Sourcing Group, Systems and Modular Furniture acquisition. The draft RFP is now available for review. The Air Force will be conducting a Systems and Modular Furniture Industry Day on 7 February, 2012. This event will be held at the Hope Hotel and Richard C. Holbrooke Conference Center, Building 823, Area A, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433.&nbsp; Please review the draft RFP carefully and bring questions to the Industry Day event mentioned above or submit electronically through the Furnishings Commodity Council e-mail address:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:Furnishings.cc@wpafb.af.mil">Furnishings.cc@wpafb.af.mil</a>.<br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) is the Air Force's primary organization responsible for enterprise-wide installation strategic sourcing. This acquisition is the primary responsibility of the ESG's Furnishings Commodity Council (FCC), an ESG sourcing team chartered with strategic sourcing Air Force furnishings requirements. <br /><br />The purpose of this Industry Day event is to educate potential bidders on the Systems and Modular acquisition, its strategic sourcing strategy as well as provide an in-depth overview of the draft RFP. The future Systems and Modular strategic sourcing contracts are anticipated to have a period of performance not to exceed five years, with a projected value of $280M during that time. This Systems and Modular acquisition will be an Air Force-wide initiative, mandated for use by all Continental United States (CONUS) Air Force procurement offices. A key component of the acquisition strategy centers on an approach that mutually incorporates manufacturers as well as their respective dealerships, allowing for the greatest level of participation by industry while achieving desired strategic sourcing results. Therefore, active involvement from both manufacturers and dealers is imperative to the success of this Air Force acquisition.<br /><br />An Industry Day Draft Agenda will be attached to this announcement, detailing other topics that will be covered during the event. We urge all interested Systems and Modular firms to attend Industry Day as it will offer valuable insight into this acquisition opportunity and provide a forum to ask any questions.<br /><br />An Industry Day slide deck will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) in the coming weeks. The FCC will not be providing hardcopy material during Industry Day. If participants would like a hardcopy of the presentation, we ask that they print it prior to arriving at the Hope Hotel. The Industry Day presentation will be displayed during the event.<br /><br />All participants must register for Industry Day by 1 February, 2012, using the link provided below:<br /><br /><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/EnterpriseSourcingGroupESG/anim.cfm">https://einvitations.afit.edu/EnterpriseSourcingGroupESG/anim.cfm</a>

<DESC><p>This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e), issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources with the capability to supply and install training aids described herein. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI, but is in need of information on potential sources.</p>
<p>Air Force Special Operations Command 27 Special Operations Wing Plans and Programs (AFSOC 27SOW/XP) is conducting a market survey to determine industry's capabilities to provide turnkey procurement of Modular Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) training sites using shipping containers, communications equipment, counter improvised explosive devices (C-IED) simulation equipment, including after-action recording (AAR) and playback technology at Melrose Air Force Range near Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico for the purpose of partnership with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) Train the Force initiatives, assisting United States forces in the defeat of improvised explosive devices.</p>
<p>The scope of the effort would entail performing a mix of design, fabrication, installation, integration, verification and fielding of approximately 600 "compound, village and urban building" assemblies on an active training range with some limited site preparation including AAR and communications technology integration, technology procedures and maintenance training.</p>
<p>The USAF has a requirement for assemblies to be delivered beginning in May FY12 through the end FY13. 27SOCONS intends to compete the Melrose Range C-IED Training Area with deliveries beginning in Spring 2012 through 2013. Our primary interface with industry will be the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (https://www.fbo.gov/) site. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) within 30 days. The Government anticipates scheduling a site visit prior to RFP release.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should supply meaningful documents indicating proven ability to execute this type of effort on a large scale. A format for providing both government and commercial projects past and present performance information is provided. In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:<br />1. A description of your company, including address, CAGE Code, DUNS and Point of Contact information and your intentions for competing for this award.<br />2. A description of your company's experience in supplying and installing mobile container based training buildings<br />3. A description of your capability to develop, produce, deliver, setup, test, and support a training area that meets the basic requirements described herein. Include information about your development, manufacturing and production capabilities (including any certifications that you have achieved), as well as any subcontractor/teaming relationships that might pertain to this effort.<br />4. Provide an estimate of the length of time that your company would require to mobilize. Address any risks that you foresee in completing the deliveries.<br />5. A description of your company's experience integrating disparate simulation software and hardware into an immersive mission training system with emulated equipment.<br />6. Identification of the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of this scope.<br />7. The Government is especially interested in the technology challenges <br />8. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy.<br />9. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 332311, with a size standard of 500 employees. Indicate whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS 332311 and if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.). Provide any rationale for proposing alternate NAICS.</p>
<p>Responses are requested no later than close of business on&nbsp;23 January 2012. Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages, excluding past and present performance reference sheets. A point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations that might be needed with regard to the information provided. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.</p>

<DESC>The following is a clarification of the previous Sources Sought Notice:<br><br>The U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), at Rock Island Arsenal, IL 61299-7300, is currently seeking interested sources of existing methods, materials or processes of commercially available dunnage to be used in the repackaging and shipment of loose ammunition items. Such packaging and cushioning materials are required to meet International shipping and Military Tactical requirements for rough handling.  The dunnage material and design must be able to be integrated into Army munitions packaging systems without loss or degradation of packaging, shipping performance or adverse impacts on the DOD logistics system.  The individual pieces of ammo weigh between .75 and 4 lbs and are between 3.5 and 10.2 inches long.   Dunnage must be able to support the shipping of multiple pieces of ammunition in one of three different sized ammo cans.  The internal dimensions of the ammo cans are:  11 x 5-9/16 x 6-3/4, 17-1/4 x 5-1/2 x 9-1/2, and 17-1/4 x 7-7/16 x 13-63/64.  The dunnage material must be able to function at temperatures between -65F to +160F and be capable of safely retaining the ammunition within the shipping container with minimal damage to the ammunition.  Any dunnage considered for this project shall be fully recyclable or made from recyclable material.  Interested firms should provide a detailed description of their commercially available dunnage system that meets the requirements above. The only new development of the proposed product should focus on fitting the listed inside dimensions provided.  Interested parties should respond by February 29, 2012 to joseph.w.hanssen.civ@mail.mil. This survey is not a Solicitation, and should not be construed as such. Any costs incurred by a respondent in connection with this market survey will not be paid for by the government.

25.  Question:
Ref. IC6 - Kindly clarify and define open source. Does this refer to algorithms?  Please also clarify what is expected by decoupled? Ref. Section 4 (page 6) - Information Category 6: What can be accomplished with open source? If not what can be decoupled? 
	EBTS	Multi versus single algorithms
Answer:  
If respondents information is reliant upon a certain definition of Open Standard, please document the definition and/or assumption as applicable to your response.Intent behind decoupled is to not have the system reliant on any one given search engine or algorithm.
26.  Question:
Ref. IC9 - Does domain refer to the Implementation Domain (1.013) and Application Specific Profile (1.016) referenced in the NIST Special Publication 500-290 Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial and Other Biometric Information?Reference Section 4 (page 8) - Information Category 9: Handle Cross- Domain Solutions
Answer:  
Cross Domain refers to moving information between classified levels (ie. NIPR  SIPR).What are referred to in NIST Special Publication 500-290 are elements used in defining a solution.
27.  Question:
I understand that the Government is not requesting Proposals at this time and is only gathering information from Industry, but I was wondering if the 9 technology areas listed in the RFI would possibly result into 9 different Solicitations, in case the Government decides to move forward with this acquisition, or if one Solicitation will include all the categories.
Answer:
The Government is only gathering information from Industry through the posting of this RFI.

29.  Question:
Paragraph 2.1 System Description indicates that the DoD ABIS is comprised of four major subsystems (ABIS Core, Search Core, Portal, and Examiner Workstations).  However, the following paragraphs describe 5 subsystems (adding the TMi).  We recognize that the TMi is intended to replace the pTM that exists within the ABIS Core.  However, can you please provide the status of TMi integration into the NGA Core, or update the description of the ABIS Core in paragraph 2.4 to reflect the new functionality/architecture of TMi.
Answer:
The Government will not provide any further information on TMi at present.
30.  Question:
Paragraph 2.8 (second paragraph) mentions that BEC ingests EBTS via Web services (e.g., AKO/DKO).  Can you elaborate on this interface?  Where are the submissions originating from?  What services are defined, and what are their interface descriptions?  Are these services defined according to the FBI EBTS 9.3 or DoD EBTS 3.0?
Answer:
This references the internal system portal.  The Government will not provide any further information on current system at present.   Services defined according to DoD EBTS 1.2.
31.  Question:
Paragraph 2.8 (third paragraph) describes a future Web Service that will allow future approved and authenticated systems to consume it and access data in the Oracle NGDB.  Does the NGDB currently organize data in relational tables, or are the Type 2 records simply stored as BLOBS?  Is this service expected to allow database queries, or simply file/record retrieval?  Will this service be defined according to the FBI EBTS 9.3 or DoD EBTS 3.0?  Can you provide access to the DOD ABIS System Subsystem Design Document and the Interface Control Document (ICD) that are referred to in this paragraph?
Answer:
This is a planned enhancement to the internal portal.   The Government will not provide any further information on current system at present. Services defined according to DoD EBTS 1.2.
32.  Question:
Paragraph 2.8 (fourth paragraph) mentions Additional external interfaces address the management of the performance and security of DOD ABIS.  Are these part of a future capability of TMi, or are these currently available through the Portal (described in Paragraph 2.7)?
Answer:
Will be available as part of TMi.
33.  Question:
In Paragraph 3 Future Capability Reference Concept diagram:  Can you describe what is meant by All external system actors will be remote capable?
Answer:
All system actors (ie. operators) can access the systems capabilities through remote access controls.
34.  Question:
Paragraph 3 Future Capability cites a requirement for Automated match response times of no longer than 5 seconds.  Can you be more specific about the start and end limits for this requirement?  Does the clock start when the collected sample is introduced into the search core?  Or when it first reached the NGA Core?  When does the clock stop?  Is this time requirement based on an exhaustive search or 500 million identities, or against a watchlist?  If a watchlist, then what is the size of the watchlist? 
Answer:The clock starts when the sample is accepted by the system.  The clock stops when search is complete and a response is generated by the system.   Search is against all records.  Watchlist size may vary, so if respondents information is reliant upon certain assumptions in regards to watchlist size, please list the assumption in the response.
35.  Question:
Given the government requirement for no proprietary standards identified in Paragraph 3 Future Capability, and the requirement for adding voice modality and open voice standards, can the government specify which standard they require for voice?
Answer:
If respondents information is reliant upon certain assumptions in regards to standards being referenced, please list assumptions in the response.
36.  Question:
Can you provide more definition to the requirements identified in Paragraph 3 Future Capability, Outside Portal to Users?  Is this portal expected to implement the Services defined in FBI EBTS 9.3 or DoD EBTS 3.0?  Are there additional requirements of the portal?
Answer:
The Government will not provide any further information on outside portal to users at present.  Use DoD EBTS 3.0 as baseline for responses.
37.  Question:
Can you provide more definition to the requirements identified in Paragraph 3 Future Capability, Quality, fidelity, and accuracy scores?  What are the threshold and objective requirements for these factors?  Or is the requirement simply to monitor performance against these factors?
Answer:
If respondents information is reliant upon certain assumptions in regards to quality, fidelity, and accuracy being referenced, please list assumptions in the response.   Monitoring needs to be included.
38.  Question:
Can you provide more definition to the requirements identified in Paragraph 3 Future Capability, Running many independent workloads at once?
Answer:
System must process inputs in parallel.
39.  Question:
Can you provide more definition to the requirements identified in Paragraph 3 Future Capability, Efficiently managing bottlenecks in data flows, to obtain right balance?
Answer:
System must process inputs from multiple sources, with varying loads and priorities.

<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong>The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will be hosting an unclassified Pre-Solicitation Conference (Industry Day) for interested vendors on February 8<sup>th</sup> 2012 from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (EST). The Industry Day is intended to inform industry of program requirements for the operation of the Cellular over the Horizon Enforcement Network (COTHEN), the competition timeline, and to provide a Question &amp; Answer opportunity<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span>CBP developed, purchased and deployed the "High Frequency" COTHEN communications radio network in order to meet CBP's tactical long-range radio communications requirements.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;This national/international network is comprised of land-based, fixed station transceiver systems, remote command and control systems, marine mobile systems, airborne mobile systems, transportable transceiver systems and many special purpose ancillary systems controlled by cellular switching technology. Each system that comprises COTHEN is specifically designed to support tactical law enforcement officers. The network is completely frequency adaptive and employs voice type 1-3 encryption. COTHEN is a primary means of long-range communications for many agencies and therefore it is critical that dedicated program management and conscientious users maintain network integrity. The network has been refreshed and modernized in the last two (2) years.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The center of the network is the Technical Service Center (TSC).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TSC is manned 24/7 to support field users in their communication requirements, tactical, emergency or disaster response such as Hurricane Katrina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The COTHEN program has been operational for 26 years.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span>The program has grown to support the Department of Homeland Security and a host of other Federal agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently COTHEN supports Air and Marine platforms and field offices and continued growth is anticipated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><br />A complete description of program support requirements is delineated in the attached Statement of Work.&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Note: This announcement is not a "bidder's conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. CBP will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to amend the synopsis for RFP NNG11346309R, Safetyand Mission Assurance (SMAS), dated January 21, 2011. The SMAS procurement was originallysynopsized as a Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Completion-type contract with an IndefiniteDelivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) component. Due to some recent policy changes, NASAre-examined its overall procurement strategy and determined that a CPFF, IDIQ-typecontract would better meet the requirements of the SMAS effort. Accordingly, thesolicitation will be amended to reflect this change.  This is not considered asubstantial change in agency requirements.  Acknowledgement of this amendment will berequired from all offerors.  All questions should be sent to David.L.Boon@nasa.gov.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p><br />This is a sources sought synopsis. This notice does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the government obligated to issue an RFP. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response. The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed below. The package should also include past performance/experience regarding projects of similar scope listing the project title, general description, the dollar value of the contract, and name of the company, agency, or government entity for which the work was performed. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than March 2, 2012. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable.

<p>It is not NRC's intent to publicly disclose any vendor proprietary information obtained during this sources sought notice. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the FOIA and other laws and regulations, information identified by a Respondent as "proprietary" or "confidential" will be kept confidential; however, the Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this sources sought notice. It is emphasized that this notice is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as any commitment by the Government.

Pre-solicitation and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the construction and operation of new and existing commercial nuclear power facilities. Office of New Reactors (NRO) serves the public interest by enabling the safe, secure, and environmentally responsible use of nuclear power in meeting the nation's future energy needs. Within NRO, the Division of Advanced Reactors and Rulemaking (DARR) Program has responsibility for managing the licensing process for new-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These include both integral pressurized water reactors (iPWRs) and non-PWR design technologies. The Office of Nuclear and Incident Response (NSIR), the Divisions of Security Policy and Preparedness/Response supports matters related to security, incident preparedness and response. Together, NRO and NSIR implement regulations and develop and implement policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities. The NRO and NSIR activities for new reactor licensing includes reviews of applications for reactor design certifications (DCs), early site permits (ESP), combined license (COL) applications, environmental reviews, and pre-application activities. The licensing activities associated with advanced reactors includes advanced reactor pre-application activities, environmental reviews, review of applications for limited work authorizations (LWA), construction permits (CP), operating licenses (OL), reactor design certifications (DC), reactor design approvals (DA), early site permits (ESP), combined license (COL) applications, and manufacturing licenses (ML).</p>
<p><br />The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) regulates the licensing and operation of commercial nuclear power and non-power (test and research) reactors to protect the public health and safety, and the environment. To accomplish this mission, NRR conducts a range of regulatory activities through 4 principle areas: rulemaking; licensing; oversight; and incident response. The technical work for licensing resides amongst the NRR Divisions of Safety Systems (DSS), Engineering (DE), Risk Assessment (DRA), License Renewal (DLR), Operating Reactor Licensing (DORL), Inspection and Regional Support (DIRS), and Policy and Rulemaking (DPR). Licensing actions include the review of requests to amend or renew a current license and/or design bases as described in the Technical Specifications or Final Safety Analysis Report. There are three main licensing actions for operating reactors: amendments; relief requests; and exemptions. The regulations for licensing of operating reactors are located in <br />10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50 (safety reviews) and 10 CFR 51 (environmental reviews). For the license renewal process, the requirements are located in 10 CFR 54 (safety) and 10 CFR 51 (environmental). In general, the staff processes licensing actions for individual plants and reactor operators, reviews licensee responses to identified safety issues, evaluates the safety implications of generic approaches to safety issues identified by reactor vendor groups, decommissions plants at the end of the licenses, and approves risk-informed revisions to plant technical specifications for commercial power and non-power reactor communities.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Sought</span></strong></p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in reviewing the myriad of documents related to the activities entailed by NRO, NRR and NSIR.</p>
<p>The technical personnel that may be performing work shall have expertise and/or experience in the following key areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive experience in the regulations and guidance of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in applicable laws and requirements, or equivalent experience in understanding regulatory requirements and associated regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and experience with the NRC's regulatory process, including the applicability of Regulatory Guide's (RG), NRC technical report designation Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NUREGs), Secretary of the Commission, Office of the NRC (SECY) papers, Generic Letters, Information Notices, Regulatory Issue Summaries, ISGs, and relevant industry standards, to the extent sufficient that the process can be applied to the potential support tasks.</p>
<p><br />Market Research Questions (Responses should be submitted in MS Word and/or MS Excel format and include the following information)<br />Page Limits - Questions 2 to 13 no more than five pages.</p>
<p>1. Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number</p>
<p>2. How long has your business been in operation?</p>
<p>3. What type of business is your company (i.e., small, 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, etc.)?</p>
<p>4. What is the size of your company in terms of employees and consultants? Please breakdown the mix between the two categories.</p>
<p>5. Do you have dedicated office space in close proximity to NRC Headquarters in Rockville, MD? (If desired, describe any office space alternatives.)</p>
<p>6. Which GSA FSS contracts, if any, do you possess? When do they expire?</p>
<p>7. Has your company worked for any of the licensee's regulated by the NRC in the past year?</p>
<p>8. Has your company effectively established teams in the past such that you could perform scopes of work outside your core competencies? (Describe the types of work and technical disciplines assembled.)</p>
<p>9. Has your company previously faced organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? How were they resolved?</p>
<p>10. Describe any other information your company deems relevant to supporting NRO, NRR and NSIR.</p>
<p>11. Does your company have approved accounting systems?</p>
<p>12. Does your company have agreed upon indirect rate agreement with any government agency?</p>
<p>13. Describe tasks you have performed in the areas of reactor licensing, design reviews and/or environmental reviews for the government or commercially.<br /><br />Amendment 1: Change classification Code from A to R - Professional, administrative, and management support services.</p>

The VA Contracting  Office VISN 22 intends to negotiate a commercial FAR ( PART 12) Sole source procurement with  University of California at San Diego, Department of Emergency Medicine, 200 West Arbor Drive San Diego, CA 92103.
 This Procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 only once responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 205-38.  A justification for sole source has been prepared in support of t his acquisition.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued; a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  Request or Quotation is RFQ VA-262-12-Q-0344..  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611310 and the small business size standard is considered, 7.0 M.  The VA San Diego is a highly academic medical center and hosts 450 physician residents sponsored by UCSD school of Medicine. Among   the clinical areas in which these residents rotate are the high risk clinical areas such as the emergency department, operating rooms, post anesthesia recover rooms and intensive care units.  Residents are required to carry code blue pagers. UCSD Residents are required to complete advanced resuscitative training (ART) provide by UCSD Department of Emergency Medicine. UCSD Art training has critical differences when compared to standard American Heart Association advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) training; Art training advances in life saving techniques are rapidly incorporated into the training in a dynamic manner, the training concentrates on resuscitation responses in the hospital environment and inter-professional team responses are an integral part of the training. If employees on the code blue team receive different training, inevitable controversies arise regarding code management, this could have negative clinical repercussions.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government shall consider all proposals received by 3:00 PM Pacific Standard Time January 26th, 2012. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.   NO solicitation document exists and no telephone inquires shall be accepted.  Information can be sent to eh Department of Veterans Affairs, Network 22 Contacting Office, Attn:  Eileen Shirey, 4811 Airport Plaza Drive, Suite 600, Long Beach, CA 90815, or via fax 562-766-2357.  Fax submissions must be followed-up with a confirmation to the Purchasing Agent via email at eileen.shirey@va.gov.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, West Palm Beach VA Medical Center (WPB VAMC).

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This action is to establish a temporary Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor Lakeside Health Center nursing home to provide nursing home services to two VA patients that reside in Lakeside Health Center. This Basic Ordering Agreement will be established for six months as a firm fixed price with an economic price adjustment.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

a)	The WPB VAMC provide care to two veterans whose primary residence is Lakeside Health Center ,the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a policy that nursing home care may be provided in licensed nursing facilities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) expense. 

b)	The VA Community Nursing Home (CNH) Program is designed to assist Veterans and their families in making the transition from an episode of hospital care, nursing home care, or domiciliary care to the community. The primary goal of the CNH Program is to maintain or restore the Veteran to the highest level of health and well-being attainable. 

c)	The CNH Program has two cornerstones: some level of patient choice in choosing a nursing home in close proximity to their home and family; and an approach to local oversight of CNHs consisting of annual reviews and monthly patient visits. Following this approach, the West Palm Beach VA has established contracts in various areas throughout Southeastern Florida. 

d)	The Contractor is to provide nursing home care in accordance with the VHA Community Nursing Home Procedures specified in VHA Handbook 1143.2. The facility has to meet all state licensing requirements including the state requirement pertaining to level of medical liability insurance.

e)	Payment to the CNH is subject to the State Medicaid rates which change semi-annually; however, our agreement allows only an annual change to reduce administration.

f)	The estimated value of the agreement over six months, January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012 is $98,930.37. 


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Lakeside Health Center is the primary residence for two WPB VAMC Veterans. This facility was chosen by the veterans as it is in close proximity to their home, family and friends, these Veterans have adapted to the facility and its staff; these Veterans and family have become accustomed to the daily routine provided by Lakeside Health Center and any change could jeopardize their health. The primary goal of the WPB VAMC is to maintain or restore the Veterans to the highest level well-being, while assisting Veterans and their families in making the transition from an episode nursing home care to the community, therefore changing facilities at this time is not in the best interest to the Veterans. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This action is to establish a temporary Basic Ordering Agreement with current contractor Lakeside Health Center, this agreement is established to allow the WPB VAMC time to execute a five year multiple award Basic Ordering Agreement.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The pricing for this acquisition will be based on the established current Medicaid rate for the State of Florida.  Based on the guidance given in M5 Part II chapter 3, a conversion from Medicare RUGs to Medicaid rates is used.  The WPB VAMC uses Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.  A negotiated percentage to the SMA Rate will be given and remain constant throughout the life of the agreement, in accordance with the Economic Price Adjustment Clause of the contract rates may fluctuate.  The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable as Medicaid rates for nursing home care is standardized categorized by geographical location and levels of care.


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was performed finding there are several businesses in the same area as Lakeside Health Center that provide nursing home care.  Market research for future agreements is dependent on the needs of the patients and resources of the VA Medical Center which is customarily administer d by Social Work service. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Lakeside Health Center is the primary residence for two WPB VAMC Veterans, this nursing home is in close proximity to their home, family and friends; these Veterans have adapted to the facility and its staff; and have become accustomed to the daily routine provided by Lakeside Health Center.  Change in care could jeopardize the health of these Veterans; therefore changing facilities at this time is not in the best interest to the Veterans. 


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  No other nursing homes located in the same proximity as Lakeside Health Center have expressed interest in establishing a contract with the WPB VAMC.  However, any nursing home that expresses interest in contracting with the WPB VAMC shall be evaluated and considered for a contract, based on the WPB VAMC geographical need, specific care needs, and quality of care.
 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  All future procurements will be posted through the Government point of entry. Any potential source who expresses interest in providing these services may be considered.  Proposed action is for six months.
